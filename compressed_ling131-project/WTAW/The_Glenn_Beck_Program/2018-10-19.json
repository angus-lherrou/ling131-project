Gilbert ... and just go\nAlbert Gilbert or Umberto and just go by Beto builders to it wider not not what you go\nBy right and when we say a year in his entire life ... what we actually mean is his entire life with the exception of time he was in public and happened to be recorded\nBecause when he was recorded it was Bob if his wife started during his campaign right I'm [laughter] I'm yes whole life yeah and that's what it was incredible about that that he really has excited hard the hard core left with these big time ... and I don't know you know is thirty eight million we're talking about\nUh you know a\nHuge Hollywood celebrities\nMean Wendy Murphy's kind of changed Texas who the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a\nOh a where you were to use them and when you're down there yeah ah yeah sort of a moderate leaning a Democrat he was also gonna\nChange Texas every time they run somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to\nIt no longer we're gonna have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return the state blue with one forever and by the way that part of it is true if they start they turn to stay with us fully do yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote standard\nBut still it's a it's not ... it's it's a way to suck the money out of small donors were throwing it away you know we keep hearing how bad people have it\nAnd I think that's true in a lot of cases ... but it's like if you have it really bad because Donald Trump is ruin your life or whatever it is is it really uh the best expenditure of your money to send it to somebody out of state in Texas was going to lose by eight or ten or twelve\nI Can't imagine that that's the thing that you should be encouraging if you actually cared about people's will be but the Hollywood crowd loves him they're talking about running him for president in twenty twenty even federal deniro a push\nTo his name out there it's written better than\nThe arrow how yeah I I mean they've got they got the name in common but I think it goes beyond that I think he likes his politics I think he does to you know [laughter] it's Bob Duvall is done it as well\nUh we Bob Downey junior Roberto Downey junior we know about that a veteran of all it's really a good collection out in the ... is a it's a big it's a big group ah Beto Brooks\nIs also a it was also [laughter] so stupid\nBut I Love it but I don't say that your name is Robert\nRobert or Bob if you're a white dude that's what you get yeah I don't even know why you get Bob honestly feel it's kind of a it's a summary of your name I don't ...

seven to nine eastern time triple eight Seventy seven be easy K oh it's going to Jack in Pennsylvania a Jack you're on the Glenn Beck river Hi\nHey pat and Steve Love you guys have a I I think you're missing a very important point and that is that over ... identifies as Hispanic and therefore you must be believe\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the band or how insensitive of\nUs mhm how hateful and dumber and ugly that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must be\nA Hispanic jak ... interesting with that sort of talk like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic or lend Native American short approved it\nBy going back ... generation try to prove it one one thousand twenty fourth yeah that that made the left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our uh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor and these things and they they hate there\nMay have destroyed or over there she handled it terribly almost like one of those things that I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is this amazing\nAh but the identifying thing there's two parts of that like\nI said as a you know say that you know\nThe libertarian sided thing right I don't care what people say they are right like it ... no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there's an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King what's to come out and say he's black when they're not black it does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it effected me in any way however we have to be able to stand up for the truth\nThe truth is that Sean King is white but\nThe truth is that right to do though is white and the truth is that Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only embraces identity politics the thick world we need to cure it\nThat is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race if a male but this is the type of thing that makes no sense I mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town to Emmett Till I mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they didn't\nAnd entire communities wet and attacked the black person is obviously going back quite a ways but it is something that legitimately as part of our history\nAnd it's surprising at least if liberals actually cared about black people and black men like they said that they do that they would want to embrace a standard like this\nTo the point behind the at I think is\nIs relatively fair and it's something that should be communicated I think to the the African American community that ... that the criticism is\nPerhaps a over done little over done potentially that the criticism here [laughter] interesting 'cause I don't think it's a it's not it does not I don't know the the uh for sure on this but what I my understanding is that these are\nThe people who are recorded this are African American that there is not like a white person doing a black voice quote unquote you're African Americans\nAre talking a and I guess the idea is that they have picked the stereotypical African Americans to do the commercial it's very uncomfortable or I don't think that this is something that French she'll necessarily using bracing\nOr by any means but it is a something that's making a lot of uh\nA lot of waves in the media because they're trying to make it seem like well this is just this Republican and who is a racist\nI mean he didn't have anything to do with the ad but besides that or is it it's an interesting double standard that we find ourselves dealing with the always\nYeah and and we get that double standard in uh to the tenth power and you know I'm I guess we get kind of used to it by now I'm just sort of used to the double standard and to the point where you almost feel silly bringing out the double standard it happens so much\nIt is and it but it's so obvious sometimes you have to for example does anyone I mean if you don't live in French hills district you know French Hill is not a major I actually don't yeah he's not a major national figure as a Congress a person\nUm so you know like I I think this wouldn't be a big national story it is a big national story today what is not a big national story is a name that almost everyone does Louis ...\nLouis Farrakhan is not a big national story today he's making no waves at all for his comments\nOr yet again about Jews now this is a person who has met with you know people like a Keith Ellison\nHe has met with several congressman he's been embraced many times but even you know fairly recently uh people meeting with him we know the ... bomber at one point apparently had met with him we didn't find that out until like he was out of office you got how the how that happens it's amazing\nBut here's the latest from Louis Farrakhan\nRear Dava ... book is a boost [noise]\nSo when they talk about ... Khan\nCall me I have\nTo come in and these semi\n\nMan do term I [noise]\nI don't know nothing about hey somebody because of their religious preference\nOkay right yeah you know anything about hating somebody because of their religion really really you just ... you seemingly just called Jewish people termites\nYeah you don't do nothing about said more clearly than that the best what he's talking about another speeches wow a for pretty amazing it to the other thing that ... that's interesting about\nLouis Farrakhan is nobody loves Louis Farrakhan more than Louis that outer sure I mean this guy thinks he's really clever yeah every every rhyming line he's got this gigantic smile on his face like he's uncovered some deep historical truth [laughter]\nOr or or or solved you know a perpetual motion machine and the guy is like he put\nEverybody in their place just now why slamming them down I don't know nothing about\nHate no religious group\n[laughter] to tell you that that might I met her mind it like you think that's a yeah he does he's really excited about himself but he relies both of those words and in age\nBut [laughter] ... what is it really should do it [laughter] he's hanging around and he's like I don't I don't have any speech is scheduled schedule one we needed speech just for this long [laughter] how excited he loves when he delivers that [laughter] things are really up about it and I don't think he got the requisite reaction\nFrom the crowd and I think he wanted more of a you know\nA gas or I laugh or something you just got a got\nA weight I don't know how to respond to that those kind of a bad state yeah I don't think I think he's going to be in trouble for that or I'll give them this though that the words do ended a similar fashion they'd do that and something that he was able to do uh-huh yeah my semi [laughter] so that's why that's why says that way our\nFull powerful\n[laughter] it's really funny man I think he just keeps so happy he looks so happy ... delivers the I Can't wait to deliver genocide above it you just big smiles [laughter] as long as he can come up with something\nThat rhymes you know people have simple pleasures and I think you know he got a couple of things he's asking for rhyming words and killing the Jews other than that yeah I just come on you know maybe a good a good cup of ice tea [laughter] you know something something simple pleasures beyond that\nI mean he's he's he's said some pretty outrageous things that get very little coverage and this is another one um people just they seem to kind of ignore him and act like a he's not there supporting Democrats he's kind of not there you know at the very edge of the left\nA but\nIf anybody on the right again this was the double standard hadn't said anything approaching that ... uh about any ... can you imagine if somebody on the right had said something like that about Muslims would that be everywhere it would be everywhere are on the mainstream media\nUm but he for some reason kind of flies under the radar and gets away with all this stuff uh I\nMean he still hasn't really suffered any consequences from talking about killing Malcolm X. even ... um she pretty much ... what'd you pretty much admitted with this you\nKnow and I do mama's another city if you attack\nYesterday the day and tomorrow [noise]\n...

networks are which is great and also get the podcast sign up for the black issue to subscribe to not only the pockets of the radio show that you hear every day with a with going back but also a pat gray unleashed\nA you know uh you can also get a Japanese podcast which we are we talking to ... her a little bit um his broadcasts of course is called chewing the fat\nWas with Joe Frazier which is I don't know that expression oh I was like I don't know you know we're talking about his yeah we're just now talk of the things over there [laughter] we've talked a little bit about the elections said today or this this update is kind of fascinating\nUm I think if you want to what a boiled down quick version of where we stand at this very moment it looks very likely that the GOP will hold the Senate it looks very likely that the ... will lose the house that you know because governors there was a bunch of stories there there's a lot of individual stories on both sides but if you're just going to summarize overall\nThat likely what we're looking at right now things can change as we know I don't know lock on either one of them I'm a things things can change in significant ways there's one thing that will not change however in this race which is the Democrats have found a way to milk there are people out of a lot\nOf money a lot of money\nThis is of course the party that constantly tells us they want money out of politics they just they can't do it\nThey don't they do not want people buying elections they don't want to do and they constantly are out raising a ... Republicans in these big high profile races you know presidency and things like that ... famously\nI'm outraged everybody in the universe and you know Donald Trump spent like nothing on his campaign twenty sixteen yeah it's a it's an under told story of that election we Hillary the if the idea if it's true that you can buy elections Hillary Clinton absolutely would have won\nWhen she had way more money far more resources or because you know Donald Trump didn't\nThrow a ... a lot of his own money into the race it they just ran it on a shoestring promote much of the time and they were still able to win it kinda disapproves every liberal theory about money in politics\n'cause he was going to go on the theory that he didn't need anybody else's money so he didn't he sort of didn't try to fund raise much no I mean he ... he he raised some money and a little bit yeah and he used some of his own money but it wasn't like a billion dollars like she did know it wasn't even close um and this is that\nLike ... you know part of that if he's a big celebrity right like he was a celebrity before he was a candidate so he's able to get a lot of TV Time for free and and everybody was covering him all the time you could see now I mean even after he's president\nThat the media the media is absolutely obsessed with him as a person I just they cannot get enough of him talking about anything every single story you know Saudi Saudi Arabia version was all about Trump every story is all about Trump all the time\nI mean this is a foreign a citizen who was living in America who was murdered in a foreign\nEmbassy in Turkey by someone likely in Saudi Arabia or you know from Saudi Arabia ... ... that's about Trump it's about Donald Trump somehow yeah I I don't know why that is yeah but it that's the case so there are some differences there we will have another test of this\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national polls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know what this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing\n'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats a to point one percent chance to really unlikely like you say that that an absolute\nNo it's not going to get to eighty three right ...\n... the models are also showing there's they point one chance for Republicans\nTo hold the same amount of seats they have now\nIt's that bad and environment the same same percentage chance the the crazy outlier possibility is Democrats plus eighty three Republicans plus zero what is the chance of\nNot holding the same amount of seats by keeping the majority about twenty percent they're saying about uh twenty percent chance they can keep the majority right now wow that about about the same percentage chance that Democrats can get the Senate\n[laughter] so I mean ... look and if they get the house if ... if all the Democrats do is get the house they're going to be able to launch investigations like crazy right they are going to it's going to be a nightmare I don't know certainly impeach a relative each in right now will be convicted no no the when I Want a ... there's no chance of it really affected unless something dramatic were to happen right\nBecause you have to get there it's sixty seven seats pay into the stuff that are that I knew it was sixty seven seats in ... and they're not gonna get anywhere close to that even if they get the majority in the Senate they're not going to be able to do that\nBut they will have a subpoena power\nThey will they will bogged down the administration in constant investigations Adam look\nInvestigating something that's real it's fine\nWhat they are going to do is not an issue not ... it's going to be ridiculous they're gonna investigate it'd be a nightmare you know there's a new story up today that Ivanka Trump may have committed a crime if you heard this no\nBecause when she was promoting the sale of real estate or in a when she was back in the day and you know doing her job was with the Trump Organization see she said things like well is is that what this one's almost sold out\nAnd it was not almost sold out like were they saying like our new building in a in in New York or you should get it now because it's almost sold out and in reality it was only like twenty percent sold out\nNow look there's a lot of guys the gate that he made right like you shouldn't say that because if someone's investing in ... investigation

the government's a a word of grants to the United states conference of Catholic bishops to provide services to unaccompanied minor illegal aliens in trafficking victims\nNow you might say well the reason why they no one's covering that 'cause it sounds really boring and that is true however it's there's some interesting stuff in there they had a thirty four page opinion and they shut down the hill use argument saying okay the Catholics were not trying to endorse or ... over to a to a religion they were just hoping\nSo that no surprise there the ACLU sues everybody over everything however buried in the middle of the this is from the federal ... buried in the middle\nOf the court's analysis was a shocking realization revelation Obama administration officials transported a pregnant miners in federal custody to New Mexico to obtain abortions in order to circumvent ... parental consent laws and other states\nAnd email exchange between to health and Human Services employees in April twenty fourteen exposed this fact\nIn discussing Maria a pregnant minor held at a temporary shelter possibly in Texas or Florida\nThe workers noted that Maria stay to she wanted an abortion and did not want her parents to know that she was pregnant at the time are we as parents who are the horror sponsors were located in Florida Maria was in custody of the federal office of refugee resettlement\nAfter learning Maria had requested it abortion according to government emails to field specials looked into the abortion laws in both Texas and Florida and reported that the general rule in both states was minors could not have abortions without parental consent\nWith certain exceptions like a waiver in dead they went the other way and took her to New Mexico for an abortion\nYou know exercise can swallow a little bit of a stroke of regulation and not not deal with it and that's why Google writes things you know they're they're heavily involved in in a lot of the net neutrality stuff and I got her Google ... like they can take a little bit of a deal with it in it you know if the guy down who's starting up something new that winds up getting punished\nBut listen we all I think we all can agree that something has to be done because of you know with what\nWe cannot ... of the things that they're going to try it or not\nWhat what we can not at all of the things that they're going to try\nIt or not it'll share the latest report from the guy who used to see a says the share of low carbon energy that we use the power transportation will need to rise from five percent or twenty five percent to forty five percent twenty fifty just to keep global warming to two degrees centigrade you something has to be done\nMm right yeah well the ... the world is that a really rough run of it in that first degree\n[laughter] I mean one hundred years she well disaster\nFor humanity and get out it it's almost killed everyone on the planet oh my gosh now sure the the population has exploded a medical advances have exploded civilization has been spread throughout the world to have a poverty just in the past Twenty years has dropped by hundreds of millions if not billions\nOr even tens of thousands of kids who normally would die just a couple of decades ago now live but let's complain about that time but what about the ice caps though what about the polar ice caps yeah why are they going that's a good point why are they gonna I\nThink if you are they completely gone if you're writing the story of the ... century what you're going to write about number one is going to be that you know the point seven degree\nTemperature rise and number two is going to be the you know point one\nOf a ... millimeter the prize or whatever it is a per decade over the past hundred years because sea level rise is the thing that defines the last century yeah everyone's like oh my gosh if I remember when\nThere were a bunch of states to the west of South Carolina in North Carolina remember that now they're all under water that's what everyone will talk about when talking about the ... century you know the wonderful advancement\nGoing back to you know uh to uh actually I'm giving their million and still not being enough it's never enough right I mean these companies it's never enough they're given we have the story about clean next rebranding their man sized issues because of the gender backlash\nYeah what did they do um the weather's been many people have complained meant doing in the story and from a\n... a clerk who is the maker of Kleenex um\nMany people have complained that man's size shoes fits it's offensive or sex right and not inclusive yeah yeah ...\nThey're all complaining about uh you know lady foot locker to write like there's there are complaining about things that are designed specifically for women know\nAre you what you're trying to make fun of those young now so I Do have a guy saying that ... are you aware of dodge the leader of the ...\nCampaign man [laughter] I mean like how to do what is it I mean I honestly I honest question\nWhat what do ... what's the difference between a female to male tissue how does that work ... well look there's a there's a difference because it's called man's size so it's just a student yes it's bigger a bigger ... yes and it's and it's just what it is and he actually said ...\nThat's what they're calling it listen man for like ... I like the term though yes it's fun and clean exit says there's no way we know way suggest that being a both soft and strong isn't exclusively\nMask lead by no way are safe way not only laying its Amanda ... says branding a suggest doors gender inequality no way no way of keeping them in science there they're sticking eye as well they're going to keep the the actual product but they're going to you know reading read the course they're going to re brand lab at what\nKleenex extra large [laughter]\nNow I'd be ... I like to say this I Believe that's fat shaming\nI live in I walked up to I Want that off that extra large stuff no way\nI think you can ... I Want to I Want you to complain colored headquarters Kleenex I Want you to complain I recently let's get him away from even the extra large cause yeah yeah\nWhat are you a triple quadruple extra large what do you live that extra large is in the name yeah so in that sense of it is actually it is it is so I mean they could you remember on\nA Dr Pepper ten which came out a few years ago yeah I still out I mean you could still have it and if that ten calorie version it's not quite diet\nWhich is zero salary be more for men right they that was their advertising campaign and they stopped at a ... for men yeah they were like and they made it was all brain it's almost like an Old Spice commercial like it was like ... with all ... you know the guys with big muscles in doing crazy things lifting cars and all this stuff\nOut of it was just a funny joke he campaign I bet they wouldn't even do that today and I ... no way I haven't seen it or they don't even talk about Dr Pepper ten anymore do they I mean now I haven't seen are supportive while they're still available and pretty delicious but why is it I Would say I'm I'm okay\nI'd be very interested to see what many people have ... equals because they also say in the story from Kimberly Clark that despite our consumer service registering consistent increase of complaints okay so what is that\nTo to to fight or or is it probably three people that are complaining more than once and I mean that's what it's got to be a couple of people on Twitter said something right in and they freaked out right\nYeah but it's like a Pam on the office and they said ah she said I doubled my sales last month and someone said with a lot from two to four and she said yes [laughter]\nIt was you know to force that yes [laughter] it's\nKind of what we're talking about yeah these are not real complaint I mean again you can always find someone to say something always get frustrated by these these uh news stories that come out to be like someone on Twitter said that they were upset and it's just like a ... one person on Twitter\nFinding someone to say any in any ... we wouldn't let her head of the nation in the English language is not an achievement it's certainly not a news story so the idea that you can find some people who are gonna be pissed off at men side I'm sure there is somebody\nSome crazy person there's probably some organization that has decided this is going to be their thing of the day to make their donors feel good about themselves as if they've achieved something in life for reality this is not a real complaint people don't care\nPeople don't care if you like man side then you make the man size thing right I mean who cares\nAnd women could buy a man's size just like if we didn't want to do we could they probably look get looked at funny\nIf they went through ... ... email us 'course not there is down side to this they be female shame too yeah they've got to be looked man chamber of a sudden you're not a man up or you can write that you can't you can't buy that your money's no good here [laughter]\nNot the way it works they like you're my ya I Do they do not yet he went\nThrough a another transition and went back about ... to three or four transition it's so going back to a female let's just say I'm and you and you were then that would be\nA a larger female\nIf you were to transition back he'd be on the large side of the female scale that that'd be fair to say yes there are ... and you wanted to go by now man sized\nTissues would this be offensive to you if you are now identifying as a woman\nVery well could be I mean I Know that are really really good but you should be okay I was at one of\nThe transitions when I was in the mail and again that was [laughter] yeah right the female 'cause yeah I they don't have a ... girl section a in the stores the fat guy section but yeah hall or whatever yeah but in a in most stores\nNot all but most stores you if you're a bigger female you have to shop in the\nMaternity section oh really and\nI Do not like the old school I I think that that we've been rectified oh isn't recently oh okay yeah I don't know if I'd go back to them you know I have to go to them\nIt's like oh okay yeah I don't know if I go back to see you know I have to go into it but no I don't think you'll have to I don't think you have to go to the
