contradiction\n[laughter] so but you took your view you guys found out that you couldn't just published nonsense exactly yeah that's a\nPoint to the right you you you you actually had to\nUm to join in on the on the grievance club is that it is that accurate\nYou really have to understand and navigate a complex arrangement of of rules so it is that we couldn't say anything that was crazy that we had to stay there than the within ... developing body\nAs theory say sometimes yes we take a bad idea like and I'm going to take home pay among adults\nWith training came in in the same men like

I mean this stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left\nIt alone leclaire Williams\nBut they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people\nI'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says when when they go low we kick them and the crowd cheers and this and he follows it with this is who the new Democratic Party is amazing\nIs who the new Democratic Party\nIs amazing amazing Michelle Obama pushed back on that today by the way of kind of an interesting way\nUm but you know what you see I think it if you are under control you can make these stories go away their craziness in the cabinet thing could probably be forgotten by a lot of voters if you look at it from the time that Donald Trump came down to the escalator to today probably his cleanest month\nWas October two thousand sixteen after that that a tape came out\nHe was buttoned up for the rest of that time and made very few statements and wound up winning the election um because people were able to kind of forget about you know started this craziness and scandals that were going on and look more at Hillary Clinton and Hearst craziness and scandals\nUm so if you look at this ... they ... they could get it to go away doing things like we're going to kick them when they're when they go low a and a few people saying it's not a mob what are you talking about that sort of stuff is not going to help them no ... and so far since the Kavanaugh saying what we've seen is really encouraging numbers\nFor the GOP particularly in the Senate the Senate has a you know we had a lot of reasons we talked about the um Robert Francis overwork versus a Ted Cruz situation where Cruz a that poll came out of fifty two forty three and a nine point lead now Cruz had been\nThere was one poll I think that had them tied a few ... most of them settled around three or four points with cruise leading\nUm that's expanded in multiple polls now to a nine to ten points I used to be more than nine or ten point yeah but pat gray who are who are not in here with us today but he was talking on his show I think it was yesterday of the day before\nBelieves that it's going to be over ten points yeah I think it'll be I think it will be between fourteen and Eighteen points to another interesting poll that came out yesterday again from the New York times\nAnd this is you know they're doing this life pulling thing I mentioned uh last hour how many calls does it take to get seven hundred and Seventy eight responses in Texas how many calls do you have to make to get seven hundred and Seventy people to talk on the phone to you the number\nFifty one thousand one hundred and Ninety to ... they had to call fifty one thousand people to get seven hundred and Seventy eight to actually participate in the poll which is kind of well you're calling Texas and\nAh and if it's marked with a New York number more and the New York times I understand\nThat uh I mean it's this is ... overall like for example York they did they also polled the eastern Long Island district New York one\nAre and what they found a five hundred and two responses they had to make twenty seven thousand one hundred and Seventy ... or you answer and seriously\nDo you know anybody that would take the time to answer that nobody does and that I wouldn't ... again if you take into account that factor which is totally changed over the last Twenty years with cell phones and and uh telemarketers and all those things it's amazing these guys get even close\nTo accurate results from polls because your self selecting a group of people who want to participate him and it's a you know who knows if they're represented\nWhy Google Home should include some sort of an F MRI so they can just read our brains and that would make it a lot of it would make it a lot easier to come to your door that yeah I wanted\nTo um another interesting poll that came out of there are times though however a was a protest of the Taylor Swift effect\nRemembered Taylor Swift after all these are all the time being silent on on politics decided to dive into it inexplicably they ridiculously ... you know again like you almost feel like with her PR team if you're going to come out and do this at least have like sensible observations and don't be just bumper sticker you know a ... you know\nQuote tweeting Huffington Post write like that was the level of analysis she provided in her little post but again she's one of the biggest celebrities in the world how does this happen as she's from Tennessee she came out in Tennessee race the biggest thing that she talked about was Marsha Blackburn saying how anti women she was and\nAnd how she didn't care about this she wanted to keep gaze at stores and all these ridiculous things that aren't true\nUm well the first of all it's come out since that um and ... uh most of the ... ... calls were uh after that\nUh fifty four to forty Blackburn leads fourteen points this was a race that was a toss up category wow now that polling holds I think we could fit a safely or understand that more people care about what Kanye West things about politics than Taylor Swift a but we'll see if that holds or not\nSo we could look at\nSenate possibly a red wave in the Senate yeah I think you know so we talked about this a little while ago to which makes sense people know that where the Supreme Court is happening and also people are in red states right and they're going to become more excited to vote more passionate about voting\nThe the the house we're seeing sort of a slight turned to the opposite effect wear purple districts um sometimes it has been a little bit lose a little more blue\nNot much to tell from it I think already the houses in real real danger I mean I it would be a surprise at this point if the Republicans were able to pull out the house not impossible it would be a surprise um uh but for the Senate real quick we had ten tossup races\nThat we were talking about before um and I believe it was three or four that they're the Republicans had to win to\nControl the Senate I think it was three they'd with three of the tent\nAt the time we talked about it but Ted Cruz race which in which he was favored by only three points was the best\nCase after case right now that's changed dramatically since we talked about that a couple of weeks ago now I'm a Ted Cruz seems to be on solid ground or any more than a three point lead\nA Heidi Heitkamp seems to be in massive danger I Would say it looks like two races were decided with the Kavanaugh hearings\nBarring some other may major development ah Heidi Heitkamp voted against him she looks like she's toast and Arthur in North Dakota now\nA Joe mansion voted for having all he looks like he's safe so those two races are not even in the ... category anymore in my mind a deadly and need to really use the cruise one which gets you down to about seven toss ups\nWhich the Republicans need to win one one of the seven will keep the Senate or in Republican hands this is much improved situation from even when it was just a couple of weeks ago the cabinet I think I think is a big part of it\nOr we don't know that for sure yet I think it will play out in the next week or so when we really have a lot of results but it looks very promising in the Senate better than it looked probably all year or so that's a that's a good thing if you care about that ... let me let me explain something or this election\nBe in that I Know ... you know technically we have three branches of government but I Believe we kind of had five we have the press and the people okay by the executive legislative\nUm and a judicial are the three in the constitution then you have the force which is the press and the people I Believe what happens in this election could put all five branches into chaos\nIf they win the house the house will go nuts and they will impeach they will subpoena which those subpoenas we'll go to the Senate\nThe Senate will be in chaos because of it because of the Democrats they will put the administrative in chaos because it will be under impeachment and it will also ah have testimony that it has to give that it will\nFight they're going to subpoena his tax records he will fight that which will go into the Supreme Court which the people will rise up and destabilize the fifth branch if you will the people as they stand up and they're starting to fight kind of back and forth in the streets you know not in a mob sort of way just as\nStarting to fight kind of back and forth in the streets you know not in a mob sort of way ... just in in ... sort of way they will the house will then again I think tried to impeach Kavanaugh or at least get him to recuse himself from anything having to do with the administration you watch\nIt all in the end of the press is already in chaos\nAll every piece of society could be in chaos based on this election\nIt's going to be a fun couple of years it'll be fun ... takes a wheel or give us a quick report maybe every day here as things start to change yeah ah and ah give us a look on on the polls I'd also like you to\nSummarize the polls that I gave this morning on the people about the you know what is it eight percent of the people are progressive hardliners\nTwenty nine percent are a conservative hardliners and the rest\nAre are being called ah the ah what was it the burned out a quarter or the or the ... the tired core\nThe people that are in the middle saying I don't want to be a part of either of these pretty remarkable and I think the good news Marie exhaustive majority exhausted majority
