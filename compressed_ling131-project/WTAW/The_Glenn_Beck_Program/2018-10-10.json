questions about what what what was the committee thinking there and people were thinking different things and so uh it was it was really two processes in one because we had the citizen committee and then we had the board or the board really want the process to be open in in public and transparent\nAnd that that's what this does uh we we bring a recommendation to the board the board ask questions or they or send us back for more data they say well what if you try this area what if you drive that area\nAnd so I think what that's what you saw a woman went through this last spring with the adjustment of high school boundaries or is that work basically that committee where it happened in public uh on video or with the board and people in the boardroom\n[noise] duct ... is a College Station ISD ah superintendent I'm so gross school district means maybe more physical growth as well\nSo where are how are you as far as your bond structures concern what's the financial outlook today what's it going to look like two or three years from now and quite honestly when will we look at another bond issue to build another school\nWow I'm right now we're doing pretty well on capacity now that we have a two comprehensive high schools are and we have adjusted the enrollment for those ah [noise]\nWe have three middle schools and we have three intermediate school so we have to pass the if the five through eighth grade level or we're opening our tents elementary school we're anticipating that we're not going to have to go to a bond friend additional campus for quite some time\nUm at some point we will have to uh put face to of College Station high school on there and that's classroom space for an additional approximately six hundred students or a third Jim\nA black box theater that's ... that's how it was originally designed and those would come in a face to ah with some of the changes that we were able to make a with a ... a high school attendance boundaries then we we've been able to push that often the future our guest right now is twenty Twenty one\nWhen we would go to a bond for that and then the next need we might have perhaps would be a third high school and that's\nIn the mid twenties or is what we're projecting on that\nAs you have John bonds that are being paid off do we see that actually the tax rate may go down and supposedly it went\nDown to point six cents this year the tax rate did and we anticipate that it will go down a more next year as we have a a as a property values go up and were able to pay off more of our debt and we have some front loaded debt from earlier bonds\nAre you ... when we when we use by money to purchase buses and um and technology we only advertise that five years and so that will roll off year or next year and so we can tell you see the bond\nRate go down and that's something that we have historically done in College Station honesty is when we have growth and we have a need to build\nCamps as we we as a community to help us by passing bond elections to do this and raising their taxes and when we can go and pass along tax rate savings to the community we do we passed that back and and know that at some point will need to come back to the meeting and say yes it's time for another phase and caution high school or an additional school\nThe best amount of planning can still have surprises in it\nAh most of the prizes we've had lately have been unfortunate that having to do with the school safety and safety for kids\nUh yesterday the governor's fifty four million dollar plane was rolled out by my breath the a TA commissioner and a lot of it has to do with mental health support so there are hardening of campuses certainly those things but but emergency response coordination um possibly metal detectors in some places\nWhere does College Station really want to be on for instance the question and metal detectors or hardening the facilities and in the emergency response\nI guess I'd say I'm In looking over the those initial four pillars of response I I Am heartened that uh it is much more than just about a sky marshals and metal detectors that it's about\nUm problems that and in his shoes for kids and a number of different areas especially when you look at mental health so that to have that in there and and school safety coordinate school safety plans as a part of the things that we are doing College Station nice day but I think things that can be improved all across the state\nI'm happy to see all of those things in there we went through a process um last spring and summer with uh our district safety team\nUh we've had at thirty seven different ideas about things that could potentially help ah our school system and be making more as a safe we ended up in acting five or six things the summer we matched those at our July board meeting and those were things like additional training\nOr for our campuses on how we deal with a intruder situations and they were hardening of our ah entered says uh and they were things like an additional support and by the way of law enforcement with two additional school resource deputies in additional mental health counseling resources so we were able to\nAddress this issue in much the same way and then multi pronged approach Scott if there were one particular thing that would ah that that would address the situation with school shootings every school would do it it's a multi faceted a issue and it requires I Believe a multifaceted approach or\nA another space it probably weren't thinking about a few years ago is a drug testing October is the first month when college stations doing drug testing tell us a little bit about how that's going\nTo keep it in a safety thing that is something that was brought to us or by my some of our staff members and community\nAre wanting to know what what's the possibility of us doing random student drug testing policy we started talking about it in March or at the board level and we talked about all the way through the middle of the summer so five months and aboard an adopted that policy\nOr at our July meeting or it's like a little bit of time to get everything ramped up and make sure we get our intention rider or consent form so that did basically go live a on October the first\nAnd the reason we're doing it is because we want a obviously our kids to be safe we want our parents being formed we want kids quite frankly it's got to have a reason to say now ah and if the marching band is important to them or the basketball team or or any of those activities are that are extra curricular in nature that they want to be involved with\nA than this gives them a reason say no to go to that party or to do what ever on a friday or Saturday Night so uh we're in the process of uh of implementing that enter um as as a part a more comprehensive part of drug awareness for our conversation nasty\nAs as a part a a more comprehensive part of drug awareness for our conversation nasty students\nDutch ... superintendent joining us a couple of things that keep changing it seems like every few years is how we measure what these students look like when they come out of our schools the job that you guys and gals are doing a story in Houston Chronicle two weeks ago or talked about even those schools campuses might have A's and B's\nCollege ready to this is really a measurement that most people are interested in and they found that many school districts that we would know or sadly lacking when it comes to\nThe kids who are really ready meaning they have to take some sort of a remedial course when they come to college do you have a measurement of what that is in College Station as far as a percentage of kids who are maybe not college ready when they leave\nI I Do but I'd like to address the the the policy implications is if I have a little bit of room to do ... um\nWhat do you go back to the earlier part of this decade that the law the land was that every student wants to be on a four by four planned for years of English math science and social studies basically all kids were being prepared in this state to go to college\nUm through through a lot of work with the legislature they realize that you know there's other ways to measure success for student says not everyone going to college but it's also getting kids ready to go into the workplace or into the military so now a as of the two thousand Fifteen legislative session\nOr it's not postsecondary reading this anymore it's see him on his college career and military reading and so that's the metric\nOr that the state uses and it reflects the change in the curriculum or because now we don't have a recommended playing for everybody we have five different endorsement plant some\nA as a result I'm a ... more kids can you can qualify to have you know great experiences once they leave school um this article went back and look basically postsecondary readiness how how well our kids ready to go to college\nAnd I would say you know in College Station I study most records are ready and they're going straight in and they're graduating as the state defines it a a college ready so the lies that I have this from the ah sixteen Seventeen type a report\nIn Seventy three point eight percent of College Station eyes de graduates were college ready meaning and again Scott that's that's done on the test said to start as the TSA the AC tea or the SAT ... friends so they got the requisite a score on that to be deemed college ready\nWell let's talk about the other side of the corner of course we've heard a lot of the facility to be ISD has been able to get as they try to work forward with career in taxi T E tell me what College Station is doing for that seat for your seat to the program\nSo we have real buster and technical education courses I'm at a both of our comprehensive high schools are in college you which is our our ... a high school choice\nActually we just start a fire school program in cooperation with teach this year so we got our first nine students in that program are really really excited about bringing that program a psychology a so we we have a a tremendous number of programs that are involved uh at at our a conference bicycles I think we're blessed to have the facilities\nAt those schools to be able to do those um [noise] we ah have not conscious played at least at this time a standalone a career in tech center I'm can't see the future I don't know if that would be in the in the ... years down the road or not but uh we've got a over fifty percent of our kids are enrolled and current legislation courses\nUm our goal is for kids to walk across the stage a reader arena wherever whenever they get to us and pre K. R. K. or when they get to middle school or high school we want them ready to enter college in into the workforce would believe we're doing an excellent job of that\nFinally today a charter school opened

don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise] um I think that's the part of the problem but but I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and\nAnd and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the action becomes an echo chamber and then ultimately\nAre we the volume just goes up up up up and the anger just goes up up up up and\nAnd we can't survive I think as a nation factional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes use a term for history will will kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I kept solve all the political things here you got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do\nI'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react to how do we respond and the answer is\nIs not to take her identity from anything other\nThan king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here and this and this focus I mean so it's to take out any for Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does and\nNot coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto we're we college my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win by by holding up signs no God hates you shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them\nAs a soul or a brother and sister not what they're doing standing up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because\nSomebody's spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I I on my desk actually right every front of me a name plate because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news I Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made it to name played it says it says lined black false prophet\nWestboro Baptist church which by the way of Cedar Rapids he does either Baptist church but but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of the members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what\nWe can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us in the book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president by oil university which is a Christian university in California\nUh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party and say legislature there in California that was tried to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well he ended up getting to understand each other better\nThe will the bill was ultimately not moved forward but dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying\nThat Christians need to try to do that and I do think that in doing so will act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically\nBecause of the moment we're in is not\nTime for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm telling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst things I see on social media I I click on a link and I find go to the bio and its first think listen thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the\nThe victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves\nOr you know story after story after story of these Christians who I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're gonna come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with Peter unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about by\nThe name of the book the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage pick it up is well worth the read\nI mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as the capital is breaking up a company that's what they did to Microsoft that's what they did to a or they tried to to Microsoft\nThat's what they did with mountain
