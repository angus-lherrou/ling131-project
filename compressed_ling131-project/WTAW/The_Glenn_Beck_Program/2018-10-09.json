is a difference between men and women who are now that can be fun you bet\nThat's fun\nBut does it move anyone forward are we talking about anything meaningful today\n\nDo you know what stopped people in Poland from helping in hiding Jews it was not the fear of opening the curtain at the sound of a truck stop and get your in your neighborhood and that if you were caught looking out the window that

want to know\nBecause then you would have to take action and fight against it were live with the knowledge and the shame that you knew it was true and did nothing we're a nation now dismissing the

ignore it and some who speak out and feel that no one's listening\nBut we as conservatives must be willing\nTo listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nOr the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for\nWhat is it that will give people value what is it when we do hit high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent Bain capital's says we will have thirty percent of unemployment and it will be a permanent thirty percent unemployment\nThat so you know is about the size of the great depression when you have that\nHow do you stop civil unrest how do you give people meaning\nAnd how do you um uh give people enough money to be able to live and and further their life it's fraught with problems and even universal basic income I think misses the fundamental point\nThat\nPeople don't want to live without a purpose and too many people get their purpose from their job\nEspecially men we can't just look at the money problem and you can't just give people stuff if you give people stuff they value it less\nAnd most importantly on this when you have a universal basic income and Seventy percent five percent of the people can work what stops\nPeople who want control and power or just basic human instinct or human reaction what stops that thirty percent from saying well wait a minute I don't have a job I Can't even get a job how come I have to live on this\nAnd they have that it will be the same old story but we must have these

remember we're the only locally owned media and ... and we think it matters WG a W College Station Bryan\nI'm Glad that for me one of the most eye opening thing\nAnd I think it was the same for you and you had to ask me something about why had I said the things that I said about President Obama in ... and it wasn't the inflammatory stuff it was why did you think he was so bad or why did you think that administration so bad\nAnd I I gave you several stories and I I remember going with the chalk board and I said there was this story yeah you know about this story is never heard of any of that you'd never heard of any of its own any of\nThem and that that was the beginning of my awareness of how loud and separate the echo chambers are and that was the moment I was like oh no people we think they know things right we think they ... they don't they don't and you know what because of that moment I read doubled\nMy efforts to read there are many times that I hear people say well you'll find that in the times actually yes that's exactly where I found out you know what I mean\nAnd so when we talk about the problem we we have those in common\nThat whether it's keeping our children safe whether it's drugs whether it's the weaponization of information and those are big problems that we need to discuss but the ... person quality of it has to happen because even though it were posting these awkward awkward thing even though it got hot\nIt's difficult to come up with a solution where one side doesn't want to talk about guns\nAt all and I'm sure you guys think that's all we want to talk about and I want to come take away are gone and that's not the K\nImpediment number two we can't hear all the options potential solutions may already be on the table but we aren't even hearing each other this exchange between Anna are prevented mother and shed a libertarian father showed this phenomenon\nOh we're trying to the S. Y.\nReasonable measures are you are you are willing to green chair to help solve this problem and to really solve this and and what that pain willing to take\nOn and on and just a sign on to the ... project which has worked very well in Virginia\nSo what was ... response to project ...\nWhat what is that whatever I don't know projects are committing you commit a gun crime mandatory sentencing you're going to the top of the rocket doctors for prosecution\nA practical tangible solution already on the table never heard of it but wait this wasn't a one way phenomenon soon after mono or mother of three teenage boys was explaining our sons and their peers consent when a classmate may pose a threat\nAnd they're called school shooters oh you have a cold shoulder to shoulder\nThey they've got that label because everybody knows who is capable of doing that\nI think that's why you know when when I mentioned earlier the red flag laws yet that's the purpose of that as a kid who in and out like this can travel writer and that enables you to go in and remove the guns\nThe response from ... a teacher a number of them who would literally just been talking about kids exhibiting red flags had this to say about the idea I had never heard that term red flag lot how is it even possible on my side I hear the term rich landlords almost daily in campaigning\nBut at least you lived in a different state and get different not\nAgain it's not about whether you think I Do at the ideas are good ones are bad one it's about the ...\nIt's not about whether you think either of the ideas are good ones are bad ones it's about the fact the other side had never even heard of them\nWhen we're talking about trying to protect our kids shouldn't every idea would be considered\nEmbedded with number three either or thinking this is another exchange that needed me between Anna are progressive mother and Mona who identifies as a Christian conservative about what each of us can do now to help keep our children safer\nI Know from my side and you know reaching out to my legislators and I think this is what I Want and if the legislators refused to take action and helping to elect people well or more in line with that thought as perhaps on your side you can get a fair but we all have a part to plant and first in\nMaking our voices heard it might be a fair trial but that's one that we cannot pay\nBut we are at an event\nOne that I Can't find the right one\nOne heck one step back and started a community level instead of relying on our legislators to fix this problem that you go into schools and you say the price of all I'm a retired Marine\nAnd my ten can go to school and I really want to help keep building secure I didn't at all I can do I can only work within the confines of my life and my time but I don't parents\nHere I have expertise I Want to do something how can we gather the parents in this call to help fortified the bill I think they're probably they're selling a restriction issue again I mean I don't know I often at all but\nTwo approaches boats don't valid and worthwhile to me but in that moment it felt very either or\nAnd a little dismissive and this happened to lunch jumping back and forth between opposing ideas as opposed to spending time discussing integrating them or combining the approaches and I just hope that the divide over the first approach the constant fight over a ... day\nDoesn't demonize up so much that we are able to work together on the second community level approach we need books not only the ruler\nSo those three impediments opinions out numbering people not tearing all the options and either or thinking we're our biggest obstacles and research together for my list and as we talk\nWe I guess as the they have to be there to help getting loud health and talk [noise] yeah I got there are a lot of danger\nWe kept running up against them but then I'll tell you about a danger to the child\nAnd never got around

five thousand of them I Would run again let all of those going just forget\nThe moment I had been fearing we reached it\nNow are you willing to put cameras though\nThey may not see that after their path because you're not even willing to let them know the impact\nSoon after and summed up how a lot of us were feeling\nComing in here I I thought our chances of getting analysts together with with I was more optimistic and I see why wouldn't we are where we are today\nAnd that that sort of ...\nThe conversation ended shortly after we all said goodbye and I sat in the room alone in texted my

sort of you know\nPassed now not even forty eight hours later had to say\nFor me I'm more than like meeting presented for all the same time like heavy issue mission maybe speaking the language and there's a new one\nAnd how do we understand someone's different language a new one like spending time with them in person\nThis is how NFL when I spoke with her a few weeks later\nTo come back and converted from server bond with a you know and I'm Wondering worked with the Iran how trainer and stuff\nAnd I got very refreshing [noise] surprise backdoor to thank God for that can sort of gave me a glimmer of hope that okay we we can come from an agreement\nThe problem isn't always the other person [noise] the problem isn't always the other side Denise explain how the shifted\nGreasy to come out to the range of than just putting your toes in the world of another person and and understanding it actually getting to see it we're not a problem in\nWeeks later Denise in I spoke about her perspective on America after our time\nTogether just a very combative [noise] ah you know very argumentative environment doesn't ... doesn't have to be in a ten agree to disagree on things you know

there was more in that moment than I had realized there's Denise just spending and I'm like saying you can't do that to her\nHair that accurate\nSo what happened in that moment I asked Denise later\nI just felt very angry that someone that was the parents to me sharing my point of view and my perspective was named blatantly disrespectful on completely shut off the main sitting next to me\nHonestly just like I needed to defend her um whether she was on my side their side it doesn't matter\nIn that moment that moment of impact the enemy line to actually shifted someone on the complete opposite end of the issue became an ally to Denise when there was a greater obstacle to overcome [noise]\nWhat greater optical so we went back to the audio around\nAnd listen to the tanks shot that I'm sick don't improve drinking any ... reasonable about ... or ... and there was one\nAgain and again the obstacles to a consensus so many of the times with the same person written\nNow are you willing to put some words you know the [noise]\nIt wasn't you know the the majority of the room shared his ideas I'm pretty much everything it was his approach to the conversation\nShe became the greater optical\nMany times we would all agree to an idea but in going around the room for contempt is we should the blonde hair for everyone around but the problem is I [laughter] I don't I Can't come out here I Am an hour to anticipating his block to a new idea a rule I think he knew he was playing\nA little before [laughter] you know we're three here I Am again and I'm asking you specifically because

intention behind it and that was because of his number\nThe number ... walking\nAids for six three ten ten or ...\nWhat [noise] remember those numbers and the sound guy was setting up and people who are sitting down and sipping their water nervously I'm Wondering how could only measure the degree of hope that they were bringing to this round table how could I gauge their commitments to finding my list to just an audio started recording you hear me asked\nThem how do you think it is likely one to ten or finding some sort of some sort of [laughter] no no John you honestly believe and then and then to me\nNumbers were privately pass to me at the beginning of the conversation and never referred to again until it was time to leave three hours and forty six minutes later he was the actual moment the conversation ended and the numbers are revealed you'll hear Rick at the end stuff it's a tough one\nCan't wait to see where our numbers come out I\nIt was\nEight for\nFake three ten ten

whatever true hope there is out\nThere we will be no Rick for whatever reason or whatever mood we've all been that person but a new one is a very powerful thing especially in a very divided America
