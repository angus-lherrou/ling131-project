looking at for the future um it's exciting it's exciting and and I think a planning and zoning and the council have had a few meetings in recent years\nBut uh but those those were rare prior to the last couple of years those are very productive meetings\nI have more than one set up thing Brian is left College Station when it comes to maintaining neighborhood integrity having temp place out there so that you can protect neighborhoods but as we move forward from this point as we look at what the future is how do you\nWhat I have said I guess the most direct thing is it seems like in College Station development has been has raced to the point where you scrape something and rebuild something that doesn't look like it did before especially in the case of single family housing\nOr you look at Bryan in the future what do you do to get people to think about hey let's take this structure as it exists a residence and let's redo it let's update it lets remodel it rather than scrape it down and build something\nDo I'm I'm not I'm not sure I agree with you totally in this K because\nThere are some areas and Brian where the the location a and for example immediately uh north of the city limit line or their west of south college\nThat location is so close to the university that economic forces are going to force that area to develop into a residential properties that support the university\nFurther into town we've had some um a multi family housing or what was the other term\nFor it I think ... is what they call it we ended up company but we know what we're talking about right\nYes a further into town we've had some of that type of structures built recently\nAnd I think if we go ahead and candy or to the market pressures close to the interstate that'll take the pressure off in areas further away\nAnd allow us to maintain some neighborhood integrity in those areas that are further away that that might succumb to that pressure if we fight the economic pressures right immediately on the uh city limit line\nWho won't let again I'm a property rights advocate you ought to be able to do whatever you want to if you want to sell it to somebody and they knock it down but I I liked the idea is if you can generate a feeling let's take this piece of property rehab but as opposed to to tearing down I think Brian is a city would\nBe better off yes I I like that idea too yeah but in that area just north of the ... uh we did a survey over six months or so ago of fifty eight structures single family structures in that area eight of them were owner occupied\nThen area had already been laws and to rental property sure so why why try to maintain it as single family structures that get rented\nWhen you have that creates inherent low density if you can clean that area and go to a high density housing you can you can accommodate the economic pressures\nAnd as I said take the take the pressure off of other areas in Bryant\nCertainly been hard I'm enjoying the seas though the mere protesting about to wrap up a long career in the elected government Brian um the other thing that happened is the county commissioners have created a mobility a district regional mobility uh authority\nNow what this does is I guess it it gives Bryan College station the opportunity to now understand how they interact with the city from a transportation or the county in the transportation standpoint and what that's going to mean for the future is both cities continue to grow\nWell uh I'm not intimately familiar with the functioning of an hour and my I have had a some lengthy discussions but they were just in generalities\nBut I think what it does it gives our region and we are an economic region or not just presidents county but the surrounding counties because of the center piece here in ... county\nAnd we need to do some planning at this point in time before we turn into an Austin or Houston you know Houston's been under extreme pressure for a number of years\nBut uh there's been a lot of changes in Austin and the last Twenty years we need to make sure that we're planning ahead so that\nWe have plans in place for land use and transportation needs Twenty years out when we don't need to start building them yet but we better have the plans in place so we don't have to say Twenty years from now man I Wish we'd had done that differently\n[laughter] exactly I think we all remember a may have twenty sixteen when the heavy winds ... through ... we'll origin and did a lot of destruction there but we also found out that dumping a lot of water in in some of the areas and Brian\nUh the city didn't handle every were was not really capable of handling some of that water we've had a lot of water here in the last uh two weeks I'm seemed like Brian has that are really under control as compared to even three years ago\nUm I I think compared to three years ago we fired much better during this week this past few weeks\nUm sooner or later we're not going to have it under control because the storm will come we are prepared for ... um you know the city government can do a lot of things about water runoff but they can't do anything about water coming down [laughter]\nWell and and again to address is one member of council um a castle gate those folks almost have reserved seats in city council they come to you and they make sure that you're aware of the problem or how do you feel about the city's response to that or that's canceled hide some sorry yeah I'm ...

do\nOn a neighborhood that's built into bloodline or that you know that that those structures are going to be susceptible to water as long as we have heavy storms I'm just I just said the city can't control the rain and water flows downhill\n[laughter] that does it ever going to change All right so you're about to finish up this elective office thing I Know that ah that you Nancy probably want to do some things that you haven't been able to so kind of what's the heart of his life going to look like from your own\nWell I'm not real sure um I Do plan to retire\nA I still expects it will retain my interest in city activities or I won't say I'll never come back a foreign elected position that it will be more likely that I'll serving volunteer you know committee appointments\nUh Nancy and I plan on doing a little bit of travelling I until this past week I hadn't been on the model T to her in about Eighteen\nMonths well do you need not again right there on one last week on going on one next\nOkay yeah so you do you do need that exactly exactly\nNow um and then if somebody came to you and said okay been your view of government that you've spent time here what are the three things that you would like to see Brian\nMove toward doing\nAs we go on down the road a that's a loaded glass\nAll along and not try to make it that way [laughter]\nUm I I think what they have been doing in the last three years is excellent they're planning their thought well uh\nThey listen you know they listen to consultants they listen to citizens um\nAnd they make intelligent decisions after they've listened\nAnd not the for the list and that's that's the real key to a good city government is a taking all the facts and make the decisions based on the facts are you got to recognize that you're not going to satisfy a hundred percent of the the ... there'll be\nTen to twenty to thirty percent of the people that aren't satisfied with some decisions but uh that doesn't mean they're not good decisions if they're made by intelligent people who are considering the community and not their own personal interest\nWell the growth has been spectacular again we've talked about things today that I don't know that we thought Brian would see anytime soon and then they move forward appreciate your support of a of a ... a quite honestly I probably wouldn't be able to downtown board if it weren't for you so I appreciate that I appreciate your service here to the community to it's a you guys and gals put in a lot of\nTime well Scott we're glad to have you on the downtown brand aboard a you've been in the community for your whole life I Believe pretty much you know and uh uh you you understand what our community needs and Italy or thanks to the time and yet thank yous you bet been hard

want to spend time on this and then maybe there are a lot like me\nAnd maybe people hit me or I'm not going to do it it's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want ... on the streets and mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten the grave and we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians ... the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to you a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means\nA but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia things have gotten even more bizarre and now now now they're saying that the a shaggy was alive\nAnd aware as they were dismembered ring him a it is just an amazing story I'd love to hear your take on it and also if you were the president or advising the president what would you do when we come back [noise]\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nAnd then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequence of that is that\nThe whole alliance against Iran falls apart and why is empowered eight times as much as they are now\nAnd so the Brotherhood\nYeah and and the and the left wing press doesn't care what happened ISIS did it have you seen one article from the mainstream media about how the Trump Administration destroyed ISIS\nNo have you seen wanted to know under Obama ISIS ran wild and killed tens of thousands of innocent people for eight years for eight years Trump gets in there and the first year he wipes them out\nBecause of math is the defense secretary\nAnd he didn't do it in a very public way it was all done behind the scenes but you can get those articles you can get those stories are even tried to get them\nAll right so bill here's here's the problem with with Saudi Arabia as I see it you're exactly right you know we're in we're in a no win situation in fact I think we're going to lose lose situation here\nStanding with people who we've known forever de de do this kind of thing all the time yeah ah they're bad people we shouldn't have been in bed with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the first place but we were and now\nThey're they're I'm a strong ally that is one of the only ones that is standing\nUp for Israel at least quietly fighting the Muslim Brotherhood and fighting Iran they we have a lot of aligned interest even though I don't want to be in bed with them but now how do you get out if\nIf a get out well but wait a minute Saudi Arabia this is different because if there is a tape of this guy being dismembered while he was alive this will set the world on fire it's different\nAnd new sanctions Saudi Arabia in a way that hurts them but doesn't destroy the kingdom that's what you have to do\nSo um but look Trump does have the heart for this he doesn't want to cancel the arms deals that are rich America doesn't want to do it and the reason that we're we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia anyways because they had it OPEC we needed that oil in the in the sixties and seventies and eighties\nDead zone anymore but now Silicon Valley takes a lot of their money\nRight so I have I say punish them you\nKnow when when it comes out and I believe firmly they did it I Do I don't think there's any doubt that they did it this guy walked into the counseling and assemble Saudi council it and he was butchered or whatever okay they did it and I believe that salt and the guy running the place he ordered it\nRight to the top so when it comes out then trout bass or say we're going to do this and figure out a way to punish\nThem um but not destroy them that's what has to happen for the good of America\nAnd do you think they'll take that punishment they've said that if we run on and they have to right\nYeah yeah I mean it's just like turkey when a letting the pastor out or the guys are going to let them out well he's out\nI mean Saudi Arabia can't exist without the United states they can't exist without the United states because it ... it will go in there and cause so much trouble yeah that'd be the place will collapse and so they need the United states can say whatever they want to say they need us\nAnd they've got to pay a price for this they absolutely have to pay a price for it\nDo you think turkey has the tape or is this last I\nHow can I possibly know back in the turkey or three times All right uh I don't know what tape they have what channel I watch I don't know anything\nWhat I I I Would think the leading national thank you sir I had just been politics highly ... gas on it I mean I Would think so too I mean\nThe Saudi a counseling is Saudi Arabian territory the Turks have no access they did go in by the way which is interesting and they say yeah we found some chemical agents of than somebody paint that something but let's just wait but I don't think anybody listening to us right now I should have any doubt\nThat this guy was fascinated by the Saudi Government\nIt's amazing how close to this is to rear window\nOr the Hitchcock movie I mean it's it's really I mean it's you know if the Muslim Brotherhood and try and swords were involved\nUm a bill always good to talk to you the book a killing the ss absolutely worth to read it applies to today shows real heroes and real real villains that got away for a way with it for quite some time\nYeah and I want to tell everybody I had back on the nose venues on Bill O'Reilly dot com yesterday for our rollicking twenty minute

led to the driving back on your bed so tell me a little bit about the battle in recap where we've been together before or was this books will tell the story\nOkay so the last time I was on we talked about that we talked about the book and we talked about than as arraigned fund um so the book is about a a a journey I basically went on last year a humanitarian work I did in a in a in northern Iraq to help\n'em with the fight against ISIS so as a former seal it was a natural fit for me to go and um and help but now I originally thought I was just going to be doing you know the the standard humanitarian thing of handing out water bottles doing a little bit of medical aid well when I got in there um the emails with a group called the free Burma rangers\nWe we ended up embedding with the Iraqi Army and um basically becoming their frontline medical support because they just don't have the resources to to do that themselves\nAnd so and I was not a medic how was it was a sniper and uh but I had pretty good medical training for my time as a seal and so we actually ended up being involved in the direct assault into Mosul to open up the um to open up the western front in Mosul and finally collapsed a caliphate in in Mosul\nAnd we were in the city for about thirty days from from the day that we entered the city to the day that I ended up getting shot on a rescue mission I was was exactly thirty days\nAnd what happened in in Mosul was just it was something I thought I Would never see in my lifetime UC evil you see pictures of World War two you see Killing Fields you you see these black and white photos and you think I'll never see something like that you know there's a certain amount of denial that you have\nWell I saw it and it was real\nAnd so in the city of death I talk about my experience of going in there and sort of being caught off guard um with the amount of violence and the fighting that was happening but more importantly the acts of heroism on on that on on the\nOn the side of the Iraqi Army and the other guys I was with it was it was amazing um to see these guys lay down their lives for others give us an example\nOf of you know that black and white film and then the heroism around it\n[noise] so yeah you look at you look at old world war two photos right you've got these black and white pictures of Killing Fields well on June second of last year it was early morning and we saw\nA fresh killing field we were literally at the very very front edge of the Iraqi Army advance and we looked out into the end of this what it used to have been a a like a six lane highway through the city\nIt was completely rubble and more holes in it was completely rubble but we started seeing bodies we started seeing bodies of dead kids elderly people there was a man in a wheelchair slumped over he'd been executed and we started seeing dozens and dozens of bodies\nAnd so instead of death I talk about how we got up there we saw what was happening but\nIt as bad as it was we saw people still alive in the bodies they were they were children walking around in on wounded and they were in shock and they'd been out there for about thirty six hours at this

blame if GOP loses but who cares I mean CNN or can you just get over it for ten seconds is there nothing else important going on in the world\nThey're not the only ones guilty of this but there is CNN in particular a treat\nLike Donald Trump ...\nLike almost the reverse of ... a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is is incredibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive\nBut like they just are obsessed with this person yeah I mean it's it's seemingly there ... all that matters are dominated by him yeah we all that matters the whole thing about living rent free inside someone else's head I mean it's so on display with CNN right now they can't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know draw does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nHow they can cut somebody up alive alive they butchered him alive

might be an end but I mean it is it as a network as a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really does dominates their lives every aspect or at least at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just look at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nMy but again like all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting because you can be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean a real flop here we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried to\nGet ahead of this or you know again it is a ... it's an important\nPolitical story for somebody who is going to run for president yeah but\nReally with Saudi Arabia [noise] going on right now with that and what that possibly means should we take a pause and we'll get some of the stock market anybody know why anybody talking about that why is it now you mean\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life\nUm and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day you're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh can we talk about today and I don't want to talk about the\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a ...\nSuch a big figure in everybody's life Ted Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job\nOkay mhm I'm Greg Abbott is just doing a good job and nobody's talking about nobody's talking about\nBecause the state's running great everything's going really well he's a great governor he's not controversial so I think the poll numbers are just how much is this person impacted my life\nIn a kind of in a bad way of oh I got to deal with this again today I got to talk about this again you can get get get get into fatigue or Indiana yeah yeah yeah and it's not a bad thing about any of them it's just like\nOh I'm so tired of this ... you know it's like the closer you get to Washington Greg Abbott is here Ted Cruz's in Washington but you know really the epicenter now and with the last president is the White House\nAnd so the closer you get the more you're like oh enough\nYeah I it's it's a it's an interesting thing I mean I it's nice to see I think\nYou know especially if ... hold on to this race would it seems like he will at the moment ah it going to help a lot of other candidates and really close races there six tossup races right now or Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Montana and Nevada all of them are are very tight um you know\nThe fact that this thirty eight million dollars is not flowing into a race in that group is a real positive for Republicans I did Democrats are very excited about better but I mean his chances of winning are very low\nAnd they've just thrown money at a candidate who has essentially I mean a very small chance of winning I Would say it's no chance for a very small chance of winning and you know that's only benefiting Republican chances of of keeping the Senate\nBut they are we here's what's happening they've made him into a national figure ... you know they're already by putting him on Ellen why why is he on that one\nHuh and what does he doesn't get done he's he think responsible for absolutely nothing right he's not he's not some like up and coming outsider right like he's a guy who's been in Congress for a long time or he has been in politics for very long time he's the whole life has basically been politics outside of his early band yours I Swear it's just because they think he's good looking\nGuy and he can he can get a good speech you know I think he's I think it's it's the bronco bomb a syndrome of two thousand for what is this guy done he will he gave a good speech in two thousand four well he should be president what is this guy done well he's been on Allen I mean it's it's it's not just that he's good looking I think that\nThere is a part of the Democratic party that does not want to go the Democratic socialism anti capitalist sort of way and Beto doesn't look like that you don't like his\nPolicies his power is ... is Alexandria Ocasio Cortez correct I mean they went ... went through them and the debate yes last night\nI'm sure some of these young yet but first of all let's start with a hit a Beddoes opening and now you may know Beto is a a Hispanic\nNo Hispanic name is Robert actually Branstad here from a Central America I Know a very recently Irish and he uh and he came out and make sure you knew how Hispanic he was the last Hispanic than war than Elizabeth Warren is chairing gee I don't know what you're talking about here's a here's the battles open\nFirst race let me thank you and Sarah from moderating tonight's debate Ken's five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people in Texas for watching this and participating in one most important decisions of our lifetimes ... or ... or ... in San Antonio\nYes the powerful see how Hispanic he is he\nCan't even stop himself from speaking Spanish ... he was trying to speak in English that entire time and just slipped into it because it's so natural for him coming from his deep Hispanic groups and that's something I Want you to make sure you understand unlike the old white guy\nOr she had gone through no he's not white or who is basically I mean it's so ridiculous Ted Cruz's old white guy who was a ... a year and a half to two years older\nThan a ... ... or Robert Francis Oregon or he's not my income ... um anyway so uh this is it was interesting to watch them because you know like as you pointed out crews runs for president he doesn't win or anything\nYou know you don't hear from him as often as you did and but he's been doing a great job his voting record is very solid I think you know anybody whether you like Trump branded like like the stuff he he\nVotes for the stuff he's doing behind the scenes with the judiciary and I don't mean just the Supreme Court I mean the ah the ah the federal courts is remarkable and we'll change the course of court decisions for very long time\nYeah he's been very involved the very involved um however Beto I don't I don't know I mean I get the idea that maybe he's a younger and good looking and can speak coherently I think that's the only thing he can is attractive to a lot of neck muscles yeah a lotta neck man who was a very shiny ... well very shining\nBut he um talked about\nAbout Cruz and his motivations remember this is a guy who's brought in the only story about Beto O'Rourke of any note if he's raised a lot of money that is his entire the entire region anyone ever discussed him because he has raised a fortune but of course he goes after Cruz over money listen\nSpeeding balancing budgets I'm only one of us has with good friends in El Paso started a small business or met the payroll every week balanced the books made sure that we deliver for our clients only one of us who served at the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats\nBut at the council members entrusted\nWith a ... a share of responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass every single year we did and for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one trillion dollars in debt when we're on track the deficit spend to the tune of a trillion dollars a year he voted to add two trillion dollars\nAnd those tax cuts just proportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash for and the already wealthy in a country that has written with income inequality unseen last gilded age why\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz except that\nOne hundred and twenty thousand dollars from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests that benefited from this tax cut\nThat's why does single for this why did they vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without ... why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses thirty thousand people to gun violence every year\nFollow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupt in Congress has become\nNow I can unbelievable hundred and twenty thousand dollars really is Ted Cruz changing and opinion over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars it's ridiculous if cruise dropped out of the Senate right now he'd get a lobbying job at some from and make millions without even thinking about it\nHe was ... I mean he's highly educated his wife worked at Goldman Sachs if we remember that there's not there's not a money\nIssue a for crews are beyond that of course Beto O'Rourke\nHas accepted or as had many ads run on his behalf ... from ... from PACs and superPACs and he's got that\nLittle uh you know that little line of ... you know I'm not telling them to do it\nAnd he's got that little a little light of ... you know I'm not telling them to do it so therefore I'm not responsible boring but again he's raised thirty eight million dollars he's complaining about one hundred and twenty thousand dollar donation to cruise to make some changes opinion worth thirty million dollars do what does that make you\nI'll tell you what it does I think thirty eight million dollars uh for some uh makes you in to a national candidate for another race not this one mhm for others who have given part of that thirty eight million dollars a in large a chunks\nThat just ... them off because\nI Want results results I gave you told me that this guy had a chance this guy was gonna do it I saw him everywhere and you still got beat and a and a beaten by how much wasn't even close\nWhere's my money where's my money\nAnd I you know I think that's how people who would react to that but\nI I Know people on the Democratic side who have given money who are absolutely that they have given given and given and they're like you know I have to tell you\nYou're you're off the deep end with crazy radicals and you're putting up people who do you have to do you have this guy this guy\nHe didn't win I I think that there are some that have given a lot of money that it can be a little pissed when a when Robert Francis or or a has to go\nBack on the you know the night shift of walking the walking the beat like all the other cops in his family [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "College Station", "day": "17"}
