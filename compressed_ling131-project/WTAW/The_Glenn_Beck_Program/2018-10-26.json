great to be with you\nAre you actually in Austin are you out on the trail\nWell I'm In Austin about to leave the head of ... painting over there I'm On a a night ... city tour right now and plenty across Texas but you know and your audience knows these laws are so important and so I'm I'm Out there talking to voters and making sure they go\nOut on Monday we had one hundred voters still in line on the a and M. campus when they closed the polls numbers have been spectacular I think we've had a almost twelve percent of the registered voters who voted early so this was uncharacteristic uh what are your thoughts on how that affects the outcome\nWell for one I think this will be an all time record for what's called a mid term election mating Icahn presidential election\nA second I think it's a great or politics or democracy or that people engaged in of all but I'll tell you this based on the metrics that I've seen it looks like things don't work out a well or Republicans you know people often say well gosh Texas is not a red state it's a non voting state\nI think people were will say two things happen in this election one we have a very high voter turnout and even with a very high voter turnout is going to be Republicans and conservatives who get elected because those are the concerns that people are are feeling like now\nWell you know there's been a population shift though in Texas we do have what eleven hundred people a day moving in some of them bring their politics with them that that does change things\nIt does change things but believe me this is my this is this the monitor all that I said there's more than a thousand people are going to like every day and it will not surprised your audience to know that many of those people that come in from California however what may surprise you is that we've been able to go\nOut of the people who have come in from California and more than fifty five percent of them are voting for me\nGreg Abbott the governor of Texas joined this morning your plan for property tax reform included a two point five percent cap on the increase without approval from to anything other than that\nThe two point five percent cap on the increase without approval from to anything other than that would be a two thirds approval by the voters now the lieutenant governor put that number four percent the ending in Glen hey you're has a plan to he's coming out with do you want to revisit that two point five percent number at this point\n[noise] let me tell you what a two point five percent number works for one that's a revenue cap\nOr we won frustration I hear from people across the state of Texas is that property taxes are skyrocketing there are too high they must be constrained\nA second is what this does oppose power in the people or people have the authority uh in the local jurisdiction or to increase property taxes more than that if they vote to approve it\nBut more importantly or this provides additional things such as ah removes unfunded mandate from Austin, Texas all local governments which is what are the biggest frustrations\nThat local governments happened and one of the costs drivers that local governments out and then on top of that what my plan does is it reduces what's called recapture all the Robin Hood funding or that we see in the state of Texas at frustrates Lebanese people because of their property tax dollars are not going to their local schools but going elsewhere\nAnd so when you dig down into the into the details of what my plan achieves it lowers your property taxes more accomplishes more good outside of just the property tax getting myself\nYou know you pointed members to a school finance commission and the two of the working groups there three working groups to working groups have issued some recommendations calling for new money in school funding\nBut for all the meetings in the power point presentations in that sort of stuff what's this final package going to look like what are you seeing and what are you thinking about right now when it comes to this information\nWell it is obviously still a progressive we won't know for another month or two but they come up with and so we're not there yet but here's what I've been talking about what I think needs to be done and that is we need to be strategic in our investment of school dollars so we can achieve a better result uh only about a or\nA school funding goes to teachers in the classrooms are teachers in the classrooms is the most important component upper education plan\nAnd we need to pay them more and so ah the school funding must ensure that\nWe're getting the highest return on investment by paying our teachers more uh that's one thing I Want to achieve the second thing is we want to put our best teachers on a pathway to earning a six figure salary\nThat we have a program like that that's been in place and the Dallas independent school district a this proven to be very effective or not only and rewarding teachers are getting the best teachers in the most challenging classrooms and it leads to almost a doubling of the outcomes of students are goal as leaders are goal as educators\nMust be to improve the outcomes of our students\nThe best way to do that is to focus on helping our teachers\nGovernor Greg Abbott joining us this morning likewise what assurances can you give retired teachers that their retirement fund will get solving remains sultan\nSher very important land that is a during this past session or we added more than a half a billion dollars to that system to make sure that it will be shored up uh we're all committed to make sure we do that once again that's coming session\nThe controllers floating a plan that he says take a portion of the rainy day fund or really called the economic stabilization fund and invest it so that that interest can be put to work what is your thought about changing up once you do with the rainy day fund from an investment point of view\nWell OK then if you'll get the credit card so we can cause they got to buy their pumpkins and get going on now I Can't wait any longer than the Tuesday we'll have a ... day

W. College Station Bryan\nBill O'Riley [noise] I Want to start with something that John Case it said uh yesterday because he was on CNN and boys and he the voice that we should all be listening to\nListen to what John Case it said about the um\nThe caravan coming from a Honduras\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nWe got to start putting ourselves into shoes or other people\nWe've got to start thinking about the consequences that others suffer and if we've been spared those by the grace of God let us be let us be appreciative let us count are blessed to stop and let us take\nMany more bill we're within six hours my crack team of ah found out who these people were what the real intention was\nA and the the press and John cases still or just say no no no the good people you want to talk a little bit about uh the Caribbean\nYeah I'm pretty sure I Know case it's a long time he used to a sub for me once in a while on or a factor on Fox I'm a good man a very sincere good nice job running a Ohio but John is a theoretical guy\nHe's not a real world guy and people want to know that\nSo he basically saying Americans we have to put ourselves in the position of somebody in Honduras\nWho uh is poor and oppressed because the society down there as violent and out of control [noise] okay\nIn a press because the society down there as violent and out of control okay but then what is the point of that exercise governor case that we allow everyone in Honduras to come to Ohio\nEvery one\nAnd the same thing with all the poor countries and the world because that's what your spouse thing by saying that the caravan people should be allowed to seek asylum in the United states that's what you're saying everyone can come here and do that\nWe would leave ... now California would be a foreign country within Eighteen months\nRight three year backlog right now of asylum um [noise]\nUh hearings and if you apply you are in the country you're here for three years at least okay what do you do arrow who does fifty percent of all immigrant families both illegal and legal are on means tested welfare\nSo there's a one out of two chance that the American taxpayers are going to have to pick up some of your bills twenty two trillion dollar debt right now for the usa\nSo if you look at the unintended consequences\nOf John ... six vision of compassion it's not compassionate all you're basically wrecking a system that does provide true opportunity for three hundred and twenty million Americans should they\nDo what they need to do to succeed you'll recognize that system governor case it do not understand that see I can and that's\nThe debate I mean I just crush them in the bay 'cause he would have no answer for any of that bill\nTell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people um\nBecause that was done it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about Soros after CBS glorified and we said no\nI'm the he's pumping in two thousand Eighteen this year alone\nTens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean they attack and smear anyone they disagree with David Brock runs one of them that's the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a benevolent mad so I Believe that these\nKinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and Honduras but I Believe they're behind a big ... big money behind as everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what even the president of ... saying I'm this is this is backed by a cube of ah Venezuela\nA and ousted president of Honduras are that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for\nAll of this or they'll have to accept our citizens\nThis is just an ongoing internal battle or in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people um and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this ... this is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government found what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now\nHe Venezuela in Cuba are together and what was formerly known as all but but they are his to the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now ... others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash going into your kid to goose ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth of George Soros or people like him did this but if\nYou know it's it's one of history's things they've done it in the past yes but the the\nGovernment of Honduras should be able to trace\n... foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here\nSo I Hope they do that if they if they believe Cuba and Venezuela actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and then by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nThere or to let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following this one uh and I would love to hear when we come back what you think the president should do uh what do you think it looks like if they do arrive\nAt the border are and how the press is going to treat this and what do sing Americans do to counter that when we come back with Bill O'Riley [noise]\nSo so um how did you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian crisis\nIt is I asked her but they have it set up where by there are tens who paid for those tents\nYou in the media

humanitarian side of this you ... you might think that they would find out is there enough baby formula yeah who is paying for it\nRight or I look we've been over ... over this we don't have a a a honest press in America anymore which is enormous story\nThat is not being covered by the decide this president going to cover themselves so these guys like you and me we do it but you know there most of the American people feel that we do have a functioning on express and we don't\nWant any level let me ask you this there was a story out this week and I know you touched on it about the um one and for college students were in Korea all distress I ... in response to the Trump election twenty five percent said they felt like they had P.

picture pretty soon though that's clear I'm sure\nI'm you know that we're going to find this out relatively quickly yeah where this guy goes I mean this is a really quick arrest it does support the idea\nThat he was at you as does the fact that zero the bombs went off completely incompetent crazy\nI mean the fact that you you mail bombs and they're finding this quickly is ... you know shows a lack of level of sophisticated on it really does yeah so we'll see we're going to do fairly quickly I think oh this guy may be just a really bad incompetent version of the\nBernie Sanders guy uh that was competent when he was trying to kill all the the Republicans are about a year ago looks like this may be our version of that guy fortunately our version if you will is a completely inept and incompetent and no one was hurt\n\nYeah I mean I if if if that's true what the van and we do\nAnd should be noted [noise] of course he's absolutely not my guy\n[laughter] no I Know that it was but there were going to say he's not my guy either yeah but you know they're going to assign him as you know\nThis is what a Trump supporter is like and blah blah blah and you know there are those people on both sides and this is why it is so a terrifying it's not going to be a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nAre going to be nuts they're going to be absolutely nuts uh and uh and that's\nWhat's frightening is ... the media just puts all of the nut jobs\nOn the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports them but they certainly say well that's not that's not you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you\nWhy is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy from burning that that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nAnd as we said at the time a Bernie Sanders is not responsible for shooting ... baseball field the nurse Donald Trump responsible for this as any logical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to note um but you know again this is we we're not gonna know enough about this this is but this\nIs a product of the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are creating\nThis um and you know it's not going to stop until both sides realize it until the media says okay wait a minute\nWhat do we do what did we do that makes you think that we're the enemy what do we do and actually listened to half the country\nThen we can move forward and create a better tomorrow\nRight and you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we have standards\nYeah you're nuts I just really hope if Jesus comes back or he's not in the van [laughter]\nYou know I'm a white van with a bunch of bumper stickers people are not going to buy it but just to me like I don't believe this guy there is no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming right maybe that's how we notice how he does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ gums [laughter] that I Would do\nSo how does how does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes with that I was ... years [laughter] [laughter] well no no no that wouldn't be slick enough you would have you know he'd\nBe oh my gosh well\nPlug yours too okay he's being a guy who would try to say we should round up all the people have than the anti Christ would be the first one to go [laughter] you know these people are nuts\nI Will be a good suspects I normally around him and his wife ... irrelevant traditionally that why do we care now spills yeah no I just wonder why I Will show that while I didn't see that one coming that's like ... like the really bad like lifetime\nMovies where they're trying to give you the big the big switch through and like it's like a it's a you know it's a rape case and you know the whole time they want you to this one person and it's a very last second you know a guy she walked by for three seconds in the grocery stores the guy who\nDid you hear like come on of course we didn't see that coming it's a nobody [laughter] well You're welcome I'm the anti Christ there you go wow same plot\nTwist [laughter] I don't know if I feel comfortable employing the anti Christ so I'm just going to concentrate on the mail bombs suspect that it's just been arrested in Florida yeah it's I I cannot believe there's not a journalist who's taken a high quality photo dissipate him\nHow is this possible they're all zoomed out from you know the helicopters and you can't quite see exactly what it says I Will say\nYou know by all appearances it does appear to be a pro Trump propaganda and now it's sort of difficult to see you know like for example a there's a shirt that was around in the elections are a lot that looked like a a Hillary a\nPresidential shirt and then it said a message on dirt that said something like a lock her up twenty twenty or twenty sixteen\nBut get could theoretically be alive an entire some stuff but I don't think you would think yeah I'm just trying to say we fish in pretty deep here I Do this all the time for the uh for the level after you know like you're trying to find okay what is the one\nCircumstance that we can be missing here and maybe that's it but it does seem to be\nA a his face in a presidential seal pretty clearly on one of the windows but again you know\nThat the media and try to make this out to be well all Trump supporters were you know evil bombers ... you know and and again we didn't do that with all Bernie Sanders supporter no they all people who have ... we didn't say that I was ... going to shoot someone on a on a on a field yeah and that guy was successful\nThat guy actually almost killed people this one didn't there's some didn't and we didn't say that when we could live with the Bernie Sanders guy\nAnd you know there's a couple of reasons why number one this stuff happens right right wing people do crazy things to there's there's plenty of them on the right as well that there are plenty of crazy does not go to one party when you get these fringe levels there are people on both sides who do it um there's a there's an ideology and we've talked a lot about this that affects many on the very harsh left\nGoing back to you know examples like Bill ... weather underground and we saw this with the Occupy Wall Street where there's some idea ideological reasons why certain types of pilots come from the left more often but still there's crazy people\nAll over the spectrum you just said hey you don't want to do it because your sights probably knew something dumb leader and you're gonna get blamed for it but beyond that it's just correct when people people are responsible for their own actions when you were an individual you act as an individual and the person who says something that you listen to is not responsible for how you take that information and how you deal with it\nNot to mention it may or not may have nothing to do with that at all\nYou know just because you happen to be a he happens to be a a a Trump supporter does that make ... make Trump's\nMaking Trump's fault that he's doing these terrible thing no and the same thing would apply as it did apply to a Bernie Sanders by the way that just a fan but campaign volunteer\nWorking to get the guy elected who then went and tried to shoot twenty five Republicans on a baseball field but again not Bernie Sanders fault at all not his fault at fault zero percent ... and the same thing would be it would apply here if this is\nHow this thing turns out I Will\nTell you there's more to find out I I Will tell you this think how fortunate we are\nIn a couple of things um go back to the bombing of the bridge in Cleveland remember that you remember that name remember anybody\nMueller bealer\nYou remember when Occupy Wall street was caught by the FBI on their way to the bridge I think they had part of it even wired did they have any of it wired but they were going to blow up bridge in Cleveland ah and they had the capability of doing it\nAnd thank God the FBI caught them but that never made any news you know it would have made huge news of the Tea Party would have been doing that rise for but they didn't\nThey you know Occupy Wall street all those are just crazy kids you know they're just they're in the Scooby Doo van there just crazy kids\nUm but seeing how fortunate we are that that didn't happen how that could have torn apart think about the blessings that not a single bomb went off that this guy may have been so damn crazy that he really thought\nWell I don't have any gunpowder bar I'm pretty sure ... sand gets hot\n[laughter] uh you know this guy is I mean you want to talk about incompetent um how fortunate we are\nThat none of these bombs went off if any of these bombs would have gone off and hurt or killed or maimed people from the other side of the world would be a different place today the media would be going crazy because look at how they're going crazy now\n\nGood news looks like we may have caught the guy yeah it's interesting and now they're starting to you know we're getting to that point where people are starting to share pictures of what appears to be the van which does appear to be very pro Trump also very pro soccer and [laughter]\nIt's an odd combination of things to be I Would I Would not assume dons a big soccer fan but who knows a but will ah [laughter] I Will say these things checkout again everyone roasted soccer people well we've said how long have we said that yeah I think ... ah I think we blame the world we're at opposite [laughter]\n[noise]\nOh my gosh the world cup\nBoots and there it is over there it is all going back to the Trump Tower and a meeting with who and who's ally yet this to Muller immediately get it right away or I\nMight be ... hard to

afford that would be a lot cheaper than what you're paying for if you go to you know one of these other places um and it would work even if you took a a you know baseball bat to it it's still going to
