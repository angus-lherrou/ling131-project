Eighteen vape pens I mean there are we to vape pens so it could be maybe they just assume their their viewers know that they're a you know I don't know\nI'm not sure what the question is what is the influence are now what causes that to happen because\nWhen I started smoking it's because you know I was in high schools like sixteen years old and one was Seventeen I wouldn't blame football anymore and so I smoked and because a lot of my friends smoke okay but that was the network at that time yeah we're talking about the network being so much more vast\nAnd so seeing some person who you don't know smoking does that includes you as much as somebody who was my age right was and I saw somebody I did know who was\nPersonally for me no I I think it's more of a peer pressure type thing with kids especially when it comes to the vaping and you know I mean they've I don't know\nWhich I think then brings in a socioeconomic situation yeah I'll situation I mean and quite honestly some of my friends were athletes smoke I mean they knew they were ... players which is you know but at the ballot nonetheless some of them would do that and again not serious smoking but they would smoke to because well the protests\nThe thing is with vaping is it's more acceptable more acceptable in other places because you're blowing out you know blueberry smelling yeah bait than you are cigarette smoke which is now obviously banned in several places and it's a lot harder to do that\nUm where you know vaping is now the interesting is I feel like vaping first took off when people are trying to find a healthier alternative to smoking and now I think kids are just starting with vaping right nothing to do with an addiction to smoking that they're trying to break it just has to do with this cool thing was so vague\nWhy is it cool is that right now because they see it on wealthy\nBecause you could get the different flavors and like Chelsea said it's not as intrusive at least that's what folks think it is ...\nAs as regular smoking would be and you don't have to go outside to do it you're right a lot of places it's okay to ... to ... in ... and we we actually had you know coworkers up here who baked and somebody who you know send in the studio\n... pretty much all day do you go in there and it smelled like ... the other thing\nIs this day thing has made it easier for people to smoke weed in public yeah now I Know he'll smells like we eat if not as strong right\nYou know day everyone sees them with this little pain and they just assume that it's a date you know that it's a it's the the smoke less or the tobacco or whatever but it's bad but in fact it's it's the there's THC in it and so\nUm especially in and I would say like festivals and concerts and things like that it's a lot easier for people to do it in public without people even second guessing it yep but uh unless you are right there next to them in that cloud of smoke and\nYou got in there but yeah and the music as

so this group would not exist if ... if it wasn't trying to show people down in trying to I'm a take them out\nI don't think so I think you just they just be at a bar like the ... they wouldn't be coming out to defend people but more importantly the the way I feel personally is America the greatest country on earth\nBecause it's not about identity politics because it's not about your accent like it is in Britain or or where you come from it's about meritocracy you come here you bust your ass\nYou at least appreciate Judeo Christian values you could be an atheist but you have to understand that that is the backbone of the country and as long as you're ... you're part of that\nYour rent we don't care if you're from Uganda Singapore you bust your ass you're into American values urine and there's not a lot of places like that in the world it's it's very rare to have that total lack of class is among that admiration for independence and liberty and hard work\nAnd we got there through a horrible list of ups and downs and and rights and wrongs and trying to correct things we had slavery or treatment of the Indians was not uh what's that what you expect for someone to whom the sermon on the mount mount with divine commanders as you can and says\nBut we we we got here altogether through all this mess and all this suffering and here we are in the ... country of the world\nAnd we get people complaining thing America was never great and and that's what pissed me off and it's ironic that we ... we get caught a white supremacist because the reason we love America is it doesn't bother with all of that crap\nGame and we have a ... for a long time I think the media basically just say antifa was a baby didn't exist they ignore them completely and as the violence has escalated their new tactic seems to be well yes there's violence but it it's the Proud Boys fault or the right wing ... have you noticed\nOr they're just exercising I my favorite is they're just exercising their First Amendment right of the assembly and Patricia of course of\nCourse I'm curious if you have if you detected a difference recently\nI'm In the approach from the media is trying to make your group\nThe real a village the real villain in this because I mean I I they were you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members and it was retweeted by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after that you become I think a central target in this is I Do feel that\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that's the only thing they have to say to America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying well we we are sick of albino violent like most\nIt's really weird concept the evil Nazis and they said we're going to rid America of the clan and Nazis now there are not so they go ... uh we got to expand the net here\nSo now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate that has to stop and I unfortunately have fallen into that that definition\nAnd it is [laughter] it's amazing that anti Islam and the media and the DNC are all in ... who like Cuomo was saying hey this is like a a match and you put it on dry dry\nGrass and then the wind just takes that I think the matches in Tampa the wind is the media and against the are starting fires\n[noise] I don't I I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the\nUh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there's [noise] you know when you when you're into a an organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and um\nAnd and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start going way off the rails and they're\nThey are they're they're the extremist party now\nIt's it's all getting into grey I mean they used to and at the same as in Britain by the way the way that it the anti uses and keep their paramilitary\nKept paramilitary wing here or the media here says the jihad is over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend\nAnd then she first language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that noted that we are not simple that's what Hillary's said when we go low or when they go low we kick them\nOr Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no peace or whatever go to their own attack then\nWe've got people on CNN saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders should be harassed for the rest of her life that's a life sentence they said the same thing about Susan Collins they're setting rice and two Republicans they got Rand Paul's wife sleeping with the gun we've got senator is getting at Texas a beheading\nAfter ... cabinet comes in I mean can you tell the difference in all those stories between people and the DNC\nThey sound pretty similar to me\nGiven McGinnis thanks for other appreciate it shares double is\nKevin McGinnis or from see our TV get off my lawn or [noise]\nThese are the conversations we should be having we should be looking inside and saying what is it I Believe what works what doesn't mercury\nSinging hymns and let them club you in the head go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and knocked punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video we'll cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least ill at this point we'll choose good\nBut it has to be really good it has to be a shining example of good it has to be over the top good\nThat's why this is where we disagree I understand you know gather in in in ah the Proud Boys what they're doing I don't think they're wrong for wanting to do it\nAnd I don't think they're wrong for thinking that it's the right thing\nBecause how is it right now how is it wrong to stand up to bullies how's that wrong how is that wrong if the police won't stand up if the media won't stand up well who's going to so I completely understand that\nAnd I can't blame you can't like I get it I just think it's not effective\nBecause what happens is the media event just takes the piece of the video that they have where somebody's swinging back and then they say it's their fault\nSo it's just not as effective do I want to get clubbed in the head no no\n\nBut if given and I can't come together even though we have big disagreements our disagreements are not on the things that actually matter\nWe're not talking tactics the things that actually matter or the principles bill of rights constitution declaration of independence Judeo Christian ethic\n\nFundamentally the left as you talked about this before shouting their abortion they're proud of their abortion and they're heroes the Proud Boys are proud of the west right and they're the villains\nOr you know I think you and Gavin ... would agree completely on on what to to be proud of or the fact that ah you know western the western way of life is it something to cherish it's a miracle it is\nAnd there's nothing wrong with with defending that at all or you know tactics are attacks tactics inside we have to if we don't defend it it's going to go away\nYou know we're all the you know we're only one generation away from losing ... says we all know and maybe it's a generation seems like it could be a week or two away at this at this rate\nSo we have to sit there and defended it it's just you know what the best way of doing it and I think that there's a there's a discussion there\nUm because I think you know I think as a ... I'm Devin would acknowledge any kind of talked about it in the interview they're going to be they're gonna be under the microscope now you got to be on the absolute best behavior as when the Tea Party was going on right when we went out and do these rallies if there were you said don't bring signs\nBecause we know if there's one sign that out of place if one person makes one sign that has any hands of something bad it will be the entire story don't even bring signs make sure you clean up when we when we walk away we want to we want this\nOr this area to be cleaner than when we got here and time after time after time that happened and they weren't able to show to say it would any evidence that\nThey were violent so here's the thing I think we were way ahead but Roger ales told me once he said you're so far ahead of the parade\nYou're about four blocks ahead they can't even see it just be walking by herself a winner or block the head of the parade you're just it was his point Ron stroll that was his point and he said you're so far ahead and I said well I I don't know I'm just doing what I feel is right and he said slow down your way too far ahead\nThat was the best advice he ever gave me I never listened to him [laughter] or a ... who is good advice and I think you know when we were talking people used to say all the time why you're talking about Martin Luther king why are you talking about Martin Luther king when we went to Birmingham I said I Want everybody here I Want you to sign that that Martin Luther king thing\nWell there was nobody shouting us down there was nobody\nDoing that and I said on stage there will be there will be there's going to come a time soon where youre going to have to decide there will be these times in our future and you have to decide now\nWe're just ahead imagine doing imagined doing a rally now we were afraid of the restoring honor rally because if you remember ride the black Panthers were going to come\nAnd they were going to engage us well the black Panthers joined with ah with Al Sharpton and they tried they just marched through they didn't cause trouble they just marched through and we let them go\nAnd there's video of people saying good things says they're saying bad things to us we're saying good things to them now at the time it wasn't like ... to ... in Portland\nAnd the anti ... wasn't there\nIf you do a rally and is\nPeaceful and asked to fall comes to attack and and we're the ones and we don't oh my gosh what am I saying good God and we don't turn away we don't raise a fist\nThat's a different story now and one that people want to hear\nBecause people aren't believing the media anymore and they're seeing these words come out of there are Democrats I'm telling you all over the country that say look\nI maybe I Believe in abortion but I don't believe in that I don't believe in partial birth abortion I don't believe in hey abortion should be you know you should be proud of it go shouted it's great there's nothing wrong with it no normal people look at that on the Democratic side I mean the voter that lives next to you\nThey look and say look I don't want to be involved in those decisions but you know I I'm I don't agree with that\nI don't agree with that out of compassion medical because I don't know people's situation yes but if that's your version of the pill and your proud of it that's a problem\nThat's who America is and they're looking they're looking for a movement they're looking for someone they can stand with who just won't call balls and strikes who are not going to say yeah that's right when Donald Trump tweet something stupid\nHey yeah that's right when Donald Trump tweet something stupid to say if it's stupid\nI don't agree with that but when he does something right yeah he did that look at that huh call balls and strikes that's where America is the first thing we have to do is come together behind those\nPrinciples I don't care if you are on the Democratic side of the Republican side or the independent to I don't care I don't care who you voted for in the past I don't care what you believed in the past\nWhat do you believe now do you believe or on the ropes do you believe this system of government is worth saving do you believe this this capitalism is worth saving do you believe the the scientific method is worth saving\nGreat that let's stand together and put our\nOur differences of approach aside because we've got a lot of work to save this thing right now\n[noise]\nBy the way Gavin has already been silenced on Twitter and voices don't start

I don't think Trump wants to go out there and be talking about how he loves Kim Jong moon publicly I think he thinks that the best way to avoid negative consequences and if we're if I got to say a bunch of words it's better\nGood we were saying the last night on the news of why it matters again the south Korea at the time to take care of that was under the Bush administration we didn't or Clinton your Clinton now we didn't do it\nAnd now you're in a situation where you have no good options well welcome to the world that we ourselves created or allowed it to be created forests same situation in Saudi Arabia let me go to\nChad quickly in South Carolina Hello Chad\nMorning how are you doing good very good do are you doing good how are you doing great or just let it you know or how much I'm enjoying the book addicted outrage so far uh gotten to chapter three because I'd like girlfriend has just made up of yesterday\nUh I just want to tell you so relate of all the ... as you open up and say describe yourself as an optimistic a catastrophe but [laughter] I I I could not relate to that uh lord yeah do you have trouble are showing people may be the silver lining whenever you're highlighting\nOr the negative aspects that data behind it are all of the ways that you can improve and uh\nUh I think it's a great book so far and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of it but I'd like to get it autographed\nAh I I just yeah I just made one to you Chad will set it off in the mail um chatted me a favor call me when you're done I'd like to hear what you think could be an\nOkay All right thanks a lot but like All right or a sponsor this half hour [noise]\nWe want to thank American financing for making this program on home sales have slowed down heading into fall but not for first time homebuyers they actually account for fifty five percent of the mortgages that have been originating now so to keep up with the first time homebuyers entering the market\nYou need a reliable lender that can process you're alone super fast and that is American financing they offer dedicated mortgage consultants and an inhouse underwriting team to secure financing for your dream home ASAP\nThey'd been in business since Nineteen Ninety nine they have stellar reviews on Google Zillow Bebe you name it\nSo if you're looking to buy you need American financing give them a call today American financing dot net eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty that's eight hundred nine zero six twenty four forty\nClothes on your house quickly get the rate loan for you American financing dot net\nAmerican financing corporation and the last one two three four WWW dot ... dot org [noise] [noise]\n\nOkay you're a busy business person you're trying to hire somebody and you've got a job site that it's just overwhelming you with tons of the wrong resumes that's smart here's what he is smart zip recruiter dot com slash back unlike other job sites zip recruiter doesn't wait for the candidates to find you it goes out and find them for\nYou zip recruiter dot com slash back has powerful matching technology that scans thousands of resumes identify people with the right skills the right education and experience\nFor your job and then invites them to apply so you get the quality candidates and the qualified people through\nThe door first and you don't have to sort through things because they already do that and they highlight the best people it's no wonder that zip recruiters rated number one by employers in the U.S right now you can try it for free at this exclusive Web address it zip recruiter dot com slash back that zip recruiter\nDot com slash ... dot com slash back fry it today it's the smartest way to hire\n[noise]\nIf you listen only to the national media you'd think America's Best days were behind us but that's just not reality [noise] I'm built forests and let me tell you America does\nJust not reality I'm Bill forests and let me tell you America is stronger than ever working with President Trump we've been able to accomplish real change which I have to start tax cuts regulatory reforms and strengthen our military we're seeing the lowest unemployment rates in decades job openings for record highs\nAnd ISIS is almost eliminated Texas families\nAre getting more of their paycheck and businesses are raising wages and benefits\nBigger paychecks more jobs more secure America those results to be proud of but Nancy Pelosi Democrats and their friends in a media want to take his mind do Obama zero ... wrote an failures like the murder of Americans have been ...
