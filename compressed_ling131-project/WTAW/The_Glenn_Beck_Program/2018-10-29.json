College Station Bryan\nGlenn Beck\nTweeted over the weekend I'm so sick of those who want to blame this president for everything he didn't express sympathy or expressed it\nFast enough stop it there's a deep sickness taking root in this country and it spread here Twitter has become the white van covered indispensable bumper stickers I'm listening to some of the responses the deep sickness stems from a man who mock sending flames hatred and bigotry\nIs not the root cause but he's fanning the flames\nYeah caffeine or you two are you doing that as well is CNN is is anybody else in the media doing that is Twitter fanning the flames\nUh watches rallies and tell me how he leads us into a unified a nation or tell you what Allison in Kentucky I'm going to take her in a minute she was just that one of his rallies uh let's see oh Glenn are you going to do an anti Semitic attack on George Soros and I\nKnow how many have you done over the years none probably too many of the couch it no none but oh yeah right Twitter is the problem will seem like it is because you don't have the facts and all you're doing is you are being a blowhard without any facts I'm not anti Semitic\nHow how how under of Israel award protected by the prime minister of where she of George Soros was paying for a anti uh Glenn Beck protesters while I was doing a defensive Israel a program in Israel mhm\nI mean I'm not anti Semitic I'm I point out the facts of what George Soros has used his money\nA really really Glen and now you're saying that he's paid for the caravan no I didn't say that he paid the pay some of the money\nFor the last caravan but I don't have anything on this caravan but let's just look at the facts\nDo feel like I'm struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to them I'm a little frustrated at the new nation I Would say yeah and I will I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what you're saying here\nUm let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nOr being an anti Semite she's his daughter is Jewish or you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively few yeah how many how many Nazis were like oh you know what\nRelatively few yeah how many how many Nazis were like a you know what yeah okay so my daughter's gonna marry this Jewish guy she's got to become Jewish that's great that doesn't happen\nAgain when you're talking about uh American Jews one of the main things they've asked the president for for how many generations was to move the capital packed in Jerusalem\nAnd the guy that did it I mean he you know look it's insane\nIt boils down to these ridiculous uh summaries\nOf what a person believes they are you telling me you can't criticize someone on the on the left that you disagree with politically because they're Jewish because then you get called an anti Semite\nAnd the same way like liberals should be able to criticize without fear of being called a racist Clarence Thomas it should be able to say I think he's wrong on the on the constitution they should absolutely be able to do that without being called racist\nBut this this bizarre thing and this is carried out today not by\nYou know Mother Jones in the Huffington Post read expected but every mainstream media source asking question after question I have a question of what part of this give me a percentage tell me please how much of this is Donald Trump's fault so here's let me let me do what the Allison just said let's make a tangible\nHere is Joe Lieberman on a very frustrating interview with CNN listen to this\nWell so shocking moment I mean I we viewed offshore on experience I I have had a life as a Jewish American\nWhich has been is not only free of anti Semitism but I've had this opportunity to be elected senator from a state Connecticut where the Jewish population as well to present and then\nAl Gore gives me the chance to run for vice president first Jewish American on a national ticket a really an ... I face no anti Semitism\nA and forgive me for going back to the end of the ... election we actually got five hundred thousand more votes and the other ticket ... which is a reflection in numbers that people were voting are based on religion so when something like this happens\nIt's shocking and it changes that reality but I Believe the reality is\nThat the American people are very fair minded not bigger than you saw it and the wholesome reaction of the neighbors who are not Jewish ... Pittsburgh and then the elected officials there it was very genuine\n... and of course this is not please CNN this is not what they want it out of Joe Lieberman they didn't bring him on to say that he had a good experience as an American you know to bring him on to fake\nPositive things they brought him onto to clarify exactly what portion of this is Donald Trump's fault tell us so we don't have to say it say he's responsible so we can have plausible deniability that that that this is exactly what we believe we don't want to come out and say at five thousand times we'll just have to what you say it OK\nIs essentially the way they lead into this next question and again he is not giving them what what they want to hear listen\nHe knew that there are those who received those to be anti Semitic dog whistles when you see them at one of the closing ad campaign George Soros a Janet Yellen Lloyd Blankfein from Goldman Sachs with dark ominous pictures and talking about the money and the international bank question okay is that something that that sends a message\nAll the first thing I wanted to say is that in my opinion this brutal murderer in pits for really had to wear was committed by a hateful loner who was probably\nMore stimulated but uh uh anti Semitism in a social media to buy anything else going around um he ... he was against\nA President Trump but it's a real a real I I was glad to see that this website as big an so down for a while and and all the social media people have to ask whether they're becoming vehicles\nFor this kind of hatred but more generally I think all of us a half to ... beginning with the president democratic and Republican leaders in Congress people in the media conventional media and the more uh\nAn unconventional social media have to ask ourselves\nTo what extent are weak contributing to the division in our society Charlie Dent that I work together in a group called No Labels trying to overcome or the way the parties have become like worrying tribes\nBut this goes beyond yet of ... and that is the one that is what would I say we're on the president makes a a statement about unity\nAh let's presume for an urge them to build on it and think about ways in which a heat you an act so that no one can ever say\nA he somehow is responsible for violence or or hatred again that the\nThe the Joe Lieberman forty seven minute response ah but I mean you get the summary there I mean first of all this guy was not pro Trump\nNot I mean he was ... viscerally\nAnti Trump in any way of he you know what I don't like about Donald Trump is he's\nToo nice to Jews that is essentially what the guy was saying on his social network over and over and over and over again so he was not a pro Trump guy that shot up this or the synagogue\nA and you know like it's important to make that distinction and how do you bring people together the exact opposite of what CNN trying to do in that clip\n... I mean without ... dip it in the nicest Joe Lieberman possible way right\nBut what are you saying is what you're doing right now by trying to make this into a situation where Trump is blamed what we should do is wrong what we should do instead is when he said something that we think helps the environment we should praise it sure certainly generally speaking we have an an issue with our discourse I think I think almost everybody would agree with that\nUm but when it comes to the shooting it's not related\nRight so here's what the media should have done this weekend the media should have said okay so what role does rhetoric\nOn social media and from the president to and from the press and everything else what role does media play in in in the life of a guy who as we saw\nThis non white male um ... tried to commit with a with a pipe bombs the guy was nuts the guy was absolutely nuts he was a loner she had finally found a cause that\nHe could you know rallied behind she ... you know was not he was nuts okay\nSo that one what role does politics play does the media play do politicians play in whining people up that's a viable aunt's question on that particular topic and not just about Trump but the whole thing\n... ... what role does the media play what about Twitter what about Facebook what's winding some of these people up what happens in the future\nK valid\nThe shooting in Pittsburgh here's how they should have covered this this guy was a anti Semite who this clearly had nothing to do with politics the guy he hated Donald Trump\nThis is just a loner just like the guy in the van and he had no friends he had no friends\nShe was a sick twisted guy what is the whole in America why are we seeing this now because it it's not Donald Trump and it's not for Rocco bomber\nSouth ... south right there's something fundamentally missing here what is it why are we changing why are kids killing themselves at a record rate\nThere is a bigger issue here than politics but nobody in the media wants to address it because nobody in the media and nobody in politics\nCan win\n\nBy the way we're doing a episode tonight on what happened in Brazil the candidate in Brazil\nAnd why does that matter why does that matter\nIt's a really important a monologue or that you don't want to miss and that is on tonight's a TV show the blaze\nAt five PM\nAlright sponsored this half hour as life lock cyber security cyber security [noise]\nYou really think that you're safe I mean with anything I mean on line I mean no no way\nNo way forward after report basically every day there was another one of these things were have five hundred million [laughter] you know subscribers or you\nKnow we're vulnerable to this particular thing and it happens I mean all the time so cyber attacks are happening\nUh people are trying to hack in and get your identity you know it's happening with the businesses and and and personally to people we've been attacked a couple of times life lock is pulled my bud out of the fire a couple of times wouldn't have known it", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "29"}
