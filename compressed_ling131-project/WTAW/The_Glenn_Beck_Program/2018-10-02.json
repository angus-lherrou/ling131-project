lifetime\nThat's the most important election of your lifetime hear of the scenarios that icy\nKavanaugh they're moving the goalposts now on Capitol and if\nI'm a ... let me just give me a couple let's say he is confirmed\nOkay he's confirmed box this kind of perjury stuff is percolating and they just make hay out of it um we go back to normal and\n... the GOP loses the house to the Democrats the Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump because they're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records\nBecause they're going to impeach him and the White House responds by going to the Supreme Court and says that the president of the time to do this yadda yadda\nUm and the Democrats than watch a cabinet to recuse himself\nShe won't do and she won't do it doesn't happen a and the the house then moved to impeach Kavanaugh guy so we've got a year or ... or ... okay uh let's say he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller okay\nThey just don't believe him and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN and they just like whoa you know and where you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate\nWorst case scenario if they don't get they don't get them through down because the Republicans and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless and they don't come out with a huge play yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know that it was going to work I don't think it'll work okay\nAnother scenario he is confirmed\nIt was a house impeached is Trump the house or in peaches Kavanaugh on perjury\nThink that is\nIf they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt and they will attempt to Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate\nThese things are happening and there there was no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump OK mhm\nThe only one that seems good to me\nIs I'm\nA ... ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nAnd the only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote\nWhich could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it um however Donald Trump comes out and while he says yeah that's over here's the guy he ups the ante\nAnd you get a guy that all conservatives are rabid about\nGuy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a ...\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's\nFavorites I mean they're okay with them but no I was willing to die in a sword for em em remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge for from Trump and there's lots of them the item leader I personally think the best course of action is to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go\nYou know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great Donald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next a nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy\nYou know yeah that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion or the ... the ... place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt\nConservatives getting to the polls\nIf if you put a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder and that and world versus Wade was a terrible decision you then have\nOver Republicans running to the polls and you'll also have Democrats but I think that your best case scenario if Laker Collins\nWe we do have I mean we're unlike any other nation on earth when it comes to guns in our history take me through like a either Sam colder or buffalo bill who am I ...\n... ... probably the most amazing Americans that ever lived I mean not only was he an engineer and and just created this incredible innovation where a person one from firing one you know must get shot once a minute or maybe twice a minute to shooting five times in mere seconds\nHe was also just an innovator in in in marketing in selling himself in\nAnd using the press to to to sell sell to other people and using and using\nEngineering to to create something that he can make cheaper so their normal American than normal man the normal woman can get their hands on it and um changed the west it change the way that the relationship a person has with with a weapon and I'm\nHere so I ... you know he was before Henry Ford he was using interchangeable parts it was like first industrial revolution so he was just amazing man and almost it was my favorite chapter to right I think\nShe needs you know more ... to check on him yeah\nSo I'm here we are at the the one year anniversary of a Las Vegas shooting of Las Vegas [noise] um did you and you're looking through history did you ever find another time in American history and I should say you know a\nPre progressive uh where guns had been viewed in America as anything but good\n[noise] no I I sort of actually you know in in the in the nineteenth century guns were sort of idealized romance books and things of that nature it wasn't until the thirty is really when I started to think about a ...\nFor some good reason people running around with machine guns shooting up places you know what else where so I mean there was a legitimate fear that some people had [noise] um but before that time no one even thought to limit\nGun ownership in any way I mean certain places in the west may be they have certain areas where you couldn't have a gun because everyone was drunk and fighting but generally no one had to go and ask the government the state uh for a gun I think in fact that when you think about\nThe second amendment how you think about the ideal is behind it tells us a lot about how do you think about freedom in general I think you're pretty authoritarian if you think that the individual shouldn't be able to defend themselves and rather should rely solely on the state\nIs you could have um you could have had a gambling and I think you can still buy a gambling I'm legally ah but you could buy a gambling gun but we didn't have those you know the mass shootings or one it's a little harder to conceal of gambling gun in a violin case\nBut also because the government's prohibition\nOf alcohol led to the formation of these huge terrible and powerful mobs\n[noise] yeah and you know they used Tommy guns and you see them in a movie and movies and um\nYou know it's kind of fiction it's fictitious only and that that the gun has come you know big blow back and it's not that easy to shoot and it was almost never really used in criminal activity there was more scare mongering by people who want it to ban I'm not I'm not saying people should have Tommy guns and driving around in their cars but I'm just\nSaying I I Am yeah I'm okay with that if you're responsible citizen I'm fine with that that's true that's very well so it's so I'm David I'm when we were together how long does ten years ago\nI I don't know if it yeah almost\nYeah so ten years ago if I Would have said to you in your lifetime do you think there will be a serious move 'em that either comes close or does\nTake away America's right to guns you would have thought that was a crazy question if I'm not mistaken do you think\nCan you\nActually yeah I Do but I Do feel\nBetter about the second amendment than I Do the first for the fifth and others have because there were four hundred million guns out there and I think that the people who who are part of the culture that I'm writing about and talking about will not hand them over that easily so I'm I'm less worried about them than I Am a\n[noise] a certainly a First Amendment I think for most but others as well\nWill you lose the second and you definitely lose the first ... I Wonder\nI Wonder uh you know I Wonder what it's going to take before people wake up to the road that we're we're sadly on uh the name of the book is first\nFreedom a ride through America's enduring history of the gun is a great read David harsh sunny first freedom it's out today you can get it as Amazon or wherever books are sold David thanks so much\nFor having done\nSorry sponsor this half hour his ex chair [noise] now I Love it when a a client is the also somebody that I I use that I Love I'm an ex chair in my office and I love it it is I'm\nI'm kind of a wheel two ways on this one still mhm\nI'm a visual guy yes and\nUh I like the visual a window especially in our studios here I like things to be visual I've never noticed but yeah I haven't noticed that yes uh and so I remember we bought these chairs um I I Can't remember what they're called everybody knows what they are those really expensive\nChairs some big designer made\nTheir ...

tell you when you life not like there's no such thing there is no way to do that think about it and it's incredible and it's one of those things that I think most people take for granted if you pass a

these out of the box ideas you know the like and nobody's talking about that yeah I got an idea OK okay we administer sodium Penn is all\nTo a Ford Kavanaugh\nAnd the entire committee mhm okay okay

there's nothing support it but maybe she's telling the truth I don't know I'm not God\nSo if I have to put them in a room and choose one or the other I'm going to choose him because\nI don't think she has enough evidence for me to credibly say yeah he's a bad guy and even if I kind of believe term I still would ... there was a ... there that it's not him he's none of it's not right to prove a negative correct so I I Hope he didn't do it\nUm and I don't think she has proven that he did by any stretch it out I don't mean beyond a shadow of a doubt I mean just a preponderance of evidence there is an inclination I mean I honestly at this point I Do not believe he did it\nAre you afraid I don't need to do not believe I don't either I'm now that's not to say I'm as you point out we're not God even though a pretty cool\nUm so it's possible okay uh but yeah I I don't I don't believe that he did right so we've plow this field over and over and over again\nHow come nobody is plowing the field on how much\nThey've destroyed her life\nSenator Feinstein is destroyed her life they lied to her several times lied to her she requested\nAnonymity they released a letter anyway causing a chain of events that would obviously reveal who she was um\n... obviously they lied to her about the Democrats are the Republicans not willing to come out and take her testimony in California yeah she was surprised by that\nI mean look to be Frank I mean she's told many lives in this process as well um and you know I I don't have those realize what low things like you know she never fly that's why she can't make it to the hearing and then oh well yes I Do fly often\nYeah I'm not sure like lives like that was her lie or of that was ally coming\nFrom her attorneys I mean it got her name on it and so yes but I think there were those around her that were also\nWilling to help her\nDiscovers some of those\nFairy tale [noise]\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with ... with the ...\nAnd we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we I think we ever be him out more we have uh\nThere's really no evidence and the forties so we I mean like we came out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alison case however\nUm what's interesting about this\nIs that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight is a split there so you assume that if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation\nDo you what do you believe from her because she's got a more recent allegation\nShe'd actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's an infinity\nAmount times more evidence in the elephant case yet only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five\nPercent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court if if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh that there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you\nIf there was amount on cabin no I wouldn't yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same ... yeah I was\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower at the lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there is in the legal standard because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply I Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships\nMany many times when he relationships breakup or someone feels jolted say things that are not true I having all that I agree with all the way you know in this case I'm\nKeith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and\nHe should we should assume his innocence unless I at three point in which he is and if especially with a case like this where it's very recent that should just go through the legal system\nAnd when he comes out of he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see\nWhether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone a in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAh investigation go through and and and the weather the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that you do not ruin people's lives over it\nI mean think about the amount of tons of evidence that there is a whiskey dealt in overall you more which everyone I mean even a lot of people in the right where like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for ... much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you get when you went through this process where the presumption of innocence agree\nSo but what I Know about she fell assumes the evidence against him okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago\nIf for ... would come with that evidence I have letters I have a photo of lead bruises on my arm\nI have um ah\nI can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not would you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge this situation wrecked right correct\nHere it is with Alison and again this is why it's important just like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever\nI also think it's extraordinarily dangerous\nTo have a guy who may have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the\nAs the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and does anybody care no this shows you that nobody in the media\nCares at an iota for this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it what they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh if they care they would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just thrown out of the Minnesota attorney general this is the guy whose second in charge of the deep what they did in the ...\nThis is not a a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America\nAnd is now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state\nAnd you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about them no no it's not it's not what about ... and I apply the same standard to Allison that I applied to Kavanaugh\nYou weren't doing this to Kevin I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about Alice yeah and look at\nBack to why it's rocket why was Brock Obama president right broke about was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight previously he made a heck of a speech and what two thousand four right\nAnd that two thousand for an election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week to to start a campaign but it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of junk residence gay at this point\nI'm trying to think too many Amazon commercials\nBut ah Ryan was his last name\nAnd he was a legitimate challenger to Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it as a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did it they went through his divorce is sealed divorce or um hearings and ... and paperwork\nOut to the public and in there there are accusations by his wife the actress who it said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true I added my horse proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of yelling Ames yeah and that's why you don't just believe them that's why they're already old because they went and got them unsealed in a democratic state\nAnd they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for a bronco bomb and you've got eight years of him\nThat it sort of thing should be always\nViewed skeptically every claim\nOf a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused and here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against Kavanaugh with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five\nPercent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat\nOnly five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to a Keith Ellison to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left I mean nothing on this story they do not care about whether for with abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise]\nAnd how your life could be destroyed\nYou are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way\nI think you've seen the issues to change\nAnd up positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they let somebody else be fine [noise]\nThis is why we must have a standard we must have a standard [noise] getting dangerous to be an American [noise] that's a frightening thing to say [noise]\nI've been telling about gold mines do silver maple flex bar that ah the maple flex\nBar here still can you open this up and and uh and break some people's pieces off what it is it's it's a it's a\nIt's a bar of silver\nA ... and it's it's made by the Canadian meant and what you do is you take it and you break it apart and it's in one tenth of announced one quarter of an ounce I couldn't get that one open either leaves open\nI think it's a trick when I think the glue that one of the uh the fake birthday candle yeah there you go okay so what you do is you take it and you can it's like a credit card size and you you break it up\nHills we're breaking with like beautiful and I think you know you break it apart and you can break it into smaller pieces now this is for silver", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "02"}
