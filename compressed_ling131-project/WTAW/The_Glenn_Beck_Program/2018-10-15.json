scholarship\nPart one introduction something has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities scholarship base less upon finding proof and more upon attending to social grievances\nHas become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly the bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this is all about and let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot ah they learn something\nA quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really\nDr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a doctorate in math or background or in physics uh James how are you sir\nGood Glenn how are you\nGood um so tell us what you were told us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into these fields to find out\nWhether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideologically biased that if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments or that they might be willing to publish though so long as they fell fell in line with the political views\nBut they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you you submitted a you got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers\nAre back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving ... literally Thanksgiving a day of are we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to hope that the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us to a very complicated\nThey call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand\nUm but it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed\nWe passed ... got regulatory reforms that strengthen our military we're seeing the lowest unemployment rates in decades job openings or record highs\nAnd ISIS is almost eliminated Texas families\nAre getting more into their paycheck and businesses are raising wages and benefits\nBigger paychecks more jobs more secure America those results to be proud of but Nancy Pelosi Democrats and their friends and a media want to take us back to Obama zero ... roads and failures pluck the murder of Americans have been gone to see a bill forest and I want to keep moving forward if you agree I'd be honored to have your boat\nI'm Bill Florence and I approve this message pay for ... for

launching loaded radio ... dot com sixteen twenty WG a W College Station Bryan\n[noise]\nThese now published studies are a just a tremendous uh I mean I don't know how if you guys had beers before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these are but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog park\nThe or the thesis is dog parks are re rape condoning spaces\nTell me about tell me about it was kind of funny actually I'm I'll tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this kind of like as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland, Oregon\nToo I'm ready for this project to come out publicly went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right I got off the plane I took an over next thing you know I'm walking caters dogs after the dog park\nWith our filmmaker and uh we get the dog park and there's this this dog they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dog's hunting them down hunting them left right and center the the owner comes over ... the\nThings the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll only now he wasn't being abusive and then stop hunting and then we get to as I lean over to the filmmaker and kind of monitor\nThat gets a little too loudly that maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given one going down here and then this lady yells out to me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this paper is happening for real\n[laughter] so what is what is the thesis\nSo the thesis for all the original idea behind the thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train man the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture and so I thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure\nTo Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day I'm ... said let's work in some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working in and just you know absolutely absurd ideas from what might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world or\nThe paper grew into that and so we made it about so called clear performer pivoted and human reactions at the park and then ended up including things like the ... we we should be able to leash man released dogs ... to prevent rape except if not politically feasible and uh gosh\nWould be great if we could put shocked collars on men but that's not okay either so we have to shock him out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them and get them from their behavior we the thesis of the paper was though that humans\nReacted differently to gay dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men or far\nDog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men were far worse about this than women and then we concluded that this is indicative of\nRape culture and we called the dog park rape condoning\nAce loosely than whites to nightclubs with a great night clubs are also right condoning spaces was no evidence for that whatsoever\n\nSo there was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry it's a little more out there but\nIt's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted\nAnd reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized\nA yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial being periodically exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the research done and in the writer\nA and in the right yeah yeah\nThat was that low to the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because ... again it wasn't like these these these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review in saying specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and it proved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that's by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project with that the papers got published or that they are award in some cases are one case and all of this is fine I says a lot in his disturbing but the reviewers comments show that the\n... which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they\nSaid our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that\nUm you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about were dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we were today and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we\nIndicates that we're human about dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dogs they go home to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being not dogs and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little video we put out to announce the project\nThey're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and going out and so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... the ... what I mean\nYou got me man [laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a a veterinary office [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which that is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle\nAnd they say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who we claimed that paper and he actually has a professional body builder or Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this\nPaper for fat body building was just kind of all areas\n[laughter] because that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean it some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking what it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a is this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit not on who did it\nAnd so a lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in ... which was very common names on purpose I actually used\nA a a I roll dice to pick up ... off of a list of\nMost in common names for certain years and the way that would blend in with lots of people\nOkay hang on hang on I got to take another breaking it will come back in and finish a white and why you thought that was important in and go through\nSome of the other studies are back in a back and just as a\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some\nSums are educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the field topics courses I guess is the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nThe gold standard journalist wasn't some fringe of journal and education this was the gold entered feminist philosophy journal hype Asia that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist which we don't might be going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called ideal laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just\nOpinion some of them are prejudice some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they wander them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've basis program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem\nJames one or the other ones they've found um disturbing or was the uh H. O. H. two ... two was was accepted can you explain explain this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that paycheck stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was a ballot writing academic hoaxes that code namely gave for convenience what they argue is that that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor\nTo make fun of or or do satire to deflate that which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will do that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this\nThis set of of\nFields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison bally hoos huge in the education literature\nThey say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but introduced the concept of twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody with privilege it's been particularly white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges Clinton question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because of privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there we just took him to step further\nThan it is interesting guy because the one about hoaxes is interesting in that if ... to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper and that was\nThe idea yeah it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ... to stand\nBy the paper that they accept it and publish or right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest in old feminist them will need to cite cost in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more to Glen ... on the ... you talked about this on the scary front at the feminist mine comp or\nWell you also did the white man my income if you did to one time and this was accepted in the white man wasn't right\nCorrect correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because I didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on them and hurt the state's her own experience as a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected\nPartly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position as the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently ... or whatever to critical race ... ... so there was a there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was\nWas rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying then that took\nMind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with a with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it an added a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things so get past plagiarism check and things like that so yeah that was a\nBit started with scanning through mine comp picking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white miss ... than\nEditing around it or the feminist one didn't do it quite the same way the feminist one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace it with with men for example it actually is the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party is chapter twelve and what its members would be expected\nTo a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that have to make the Nazis\nAnd we replaced our movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that\nWith intersection of feminism nor solidarity or allies share something to do with with the feminist movement\nAnd criticize the idea that\nUh some feminists do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism\nThan she is doing feminism it feminist for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing saying that no no the responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices and stand in solidarity with\nOther oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nHad to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later\nGoing good God this is bad am I right\nExactly that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I\nJust

the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how\nHow how can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of\nLook this is wrong but we do want to make it any worse he's trying to make it sound as if um the police\nThis is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their two nothing's\nSo they have no way to win it's a great observation there are two or political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes they that this is the job of being a mayor I get the job of being a leader\nYeah I suppose to actually have an idea and do something in which I think he did by the way I think you're right what did you went on a speak is dismayed right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes he's he's opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side\nBut yeah the ... more on the end of a side\nAnd you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI the FBI building in Portland is is under siege for ... I mean think of the balls and these guys\nThey take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building\nThey call for police police say ah we've got a call the mayor why I'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor\nGoes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what mhm\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIt's a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right it's certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that ... the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people that these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThe woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life that I think they've had to move out of the city her and her family um they took her stuff destroyed it a threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean they're just ... they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets no they're not\nThey're not punk have you paid for them\nBecause I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when but read enough history usually people are who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they're in power and they let this they let this stuff and go until the people that have had enough and then they\nDo what they want with those people and they you know use those people as\nCover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane meanwhile Alex ... Alec Baldwin who ah has a new show on where where's this new show starting to you know a\nHead to own top the top of my head I think it's yeah he's got a new show ABC coming to an ABC jeez yeah so

before the election and then right after the election as well so lots to talk about Glenn Beck dot com slash to her [noise]\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nAll of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nI was embarrassed that has allowed this in security I realized that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThen I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away\nI think I can enjoy it\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I become so anxious there were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker\nI started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility it's just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was since insecure enough already I Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is\nFascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael ... was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered if it was ever going to get old to him because what\nMakes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is a it is so in ...\nYeah he loves it I mean you can tell when you see him live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it completely\nHe says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes but when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy I've learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own style and now know critic can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I'm just seeing the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking about he's because he says\nI miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink orders and pizza place some video games and jam they came over and we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought\nWow this is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has spoken people are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that other stuff\nSo here's what he's here's what he says exactly to the reporter he pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude to deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world and prayed for us\nAnd showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in American watching Europe breakup there's never a better time for music\nThen he suddenly stops quote this\nIs my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nThat's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media\nAs if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he's got other interviews scheduled or like he's had a whole press tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that\nAnd you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in every day\nUh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nUh and and he seems to have I mean he he is making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that\nUm because he just wants to spend time with his on how many times you hear those excuses I'm so according to that and more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know and it's nice to see\nThat he he got through it\nAnd has made it into a good thing you know I I have I have ... probably more respect for Michael boo play than any other professional that I ever met in the entertainment industry\nBecause he has found a way
