pivot point for our country and if we fall down on our job it will change and it will go away and I think it will become very bad however\nIt's not the battle that you think it is you've been convinced by media and social media that everybody is thinking this way they're not\nDavid has a David Barton is with us he has a book out called this precarious moment uh he's written that with the James Carlo was a just a great great guy and good thinker 'em and they have the stats and the book and they have different things we've ... we were concentrating just for a second on millennials because\nI Know David is seen it and I've seen it because we're doing it with mercury one\nAnd when you present the facts to millennials\nIf you're not trying to when\nThey say wait a minute what\nDavid talk about a few of the millennials we've had in for our two week training course and they have actually come\nA little hostile tried yeah we have a number of Columbus skeptics here to disapprove us and showed that were all wrong and\nAnd it's All right you know we don't we don't run from that situation would you advise them and say let's have a conversation as long as you and gauge and the Congress right and so we start asking them questions and you know they have their opinions but we just ask them questions and it's kind of like they sit back and uh I don't know\nAnd so what you ask the questions that lead them to the information\nIt's amazing to see that they didn't take those questions or go back to those that taught them and change that we literally we have a girl that came in that you know learned all sorts of stuff she went back to her professor started asking her professor questions\nHe got all befuddled 'cause he didn't know the answers he now has asked her to meet with him once a week and teacher teach him what she learned and and all these classes it's amazing it's amazing\nAnd and she said she wrote a report and he said you are either a liar and you're going to get an F\nOr this is the best paper see me in my office that's right and she he said okay I Want to talk to you about your sources and she had him nailed down and said he had never here's a professor they didn't know this stuff\nAnd economics professor and he found out that founding father John Witherspoon had the greatest impact of any person in American history and American economics and he didn't know that and she showed him that and then shut them the documentation and he said okay I I Want more because I clearly did not\nBut that's the thing of asking questions with relationships and we take these these guys that come in hostile or otherwise\nAnd just because of relationships and as we tell them we have a lot of fun with them I'm quite frankly we tell them that sarcasm show love language if we don't make fun of us because we don't like you know there's the so you know we we we kid and joke and they have a great great time\nBut they come out transform and there's some of the most mature individuals and these these guys are all\nIt's in their mind to become leaders and I tell you they are so so good and it's just amazing\nWe were at a meeting in February and we I don't think I've uh notes this formally uh may I may go for it um we are going to do black history month a museum here at our studios in February\nIf you don't think that's\nA little controversial um but we have worked on this and we're working on it with the Lincoln museum and uh it's going to be a little mind blowing and really really eye opening to a lot of people on both sides\nUh and it's black history but you know not all the black history that everybody knows let's tell the black history that really nobody knows uh and that's going to be here at our studios in the month of February and yesterday we decided that because they're ... they're going to we're going to have do since we're gonna have people\nThat are going to tell these individual stories about these people in the here on stage Nineteen as you come through and they're all going to be\nI said yesterday let's get some of the kids that we met there even Fifteen Years old\nThat just we'll learn it and really know it it's really quite exciting just seen millennials what happens when they're on least and told the truth\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language there started to create signs in German they're starting to create documents and German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing\nHe said we have immigrants coming in which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration than in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separating from Great Britain 'cause he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration it's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nSimulation I mean ... the tears Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in their early youth these old principles with their language they will transmit to their children the proportion to their numbers they will share with us in legislation\nThey will infuse it into their old spirit warp and biased it's directions and render it uh as heterogeneous incoherent and distracted mass he says the solution\nIs thought better to discourage their settling together in large masses and they should distribute themselves sparsely among the native for a quick or assimilation\nThis goes right with with this\nIt seems to me necessary this is Frank Clinton seems to be necessary to distribute the um the Germans the Germans are more equally mix them in with English established English schools\nThat are now where they are now too sick we settled I Am against the it I Am not against the admission of Germans in general for they have virtues their industry for ... the great farmers he's just saying we have to get them to be Americans this is the opposite of what we're doing no Dearborn\nMichigan I mean we we want people to simulate and we don't want them reading a parallel culture where there's almost a no go zone now for for a place\nOf Somalians in in um Minnesota exactly\nAnd we got groups in West Texas creating their own separate communities and that's not it it's assimilation you want to become an American you don't come to America to take over and move it to whatever your country was you come here to be an American\nNow that's where the professors the elite groups really are and that all Americans really bad ... you know we need we need to be like Europe or whatever\nOne way to lose it is is to not pay attention to what they did and one of the things we try to do in the book is we don't we're not in the government solutions we tried to give things that every single individual can do because America gets healthy from the bottom up not the top down\nYou say that racial healing is\nFairly easy all we have to do is do it ... what what what is the plan for racial healing\nYou know that there are several things one is you've got to change some of your knowledge base as to what we find with millennials they are taught about race from the way the professor said and we shut them seven things that everyone needs to know about race and generally they don't their historical\nBut remember all stuffy I'd well those are oh yeah there are several things of this the first permanent ... permanent slavery was introduced in America by black man Anthony Johnson who sued ... on other black men\nAre we show the fact that a ... forty three percent a free blacks in South Carolina on black slaves\nThat wow one out of it yeah nearly half a one out of eight a Native Americans own black slaves and and major tribes\nAnd that didn't stop that and even though they masturbation proclamation winded slavery ... didn't\nStop with the thirteenth amendment when we abolished slavery in because we only abolished slavery in the United states but Indian nations are their own nations that right down by the way that they stopped it was years later it was probably a decade later before slavery stopped in Indian nations\nDo what we do show slavery as a human problem it is not a black white problem despite what your professors say it is a problem and the way you view humankind\nSo we go through and and show for example Tim Scott and James Lankford in the U.S Senate have come up with with this thing where you invite other people from other races to come eat a meal with you on Sunday come into your house and you know learning and touch you don't solve racism institutionally you saw that one person at a time change in a hard time seeing people different\nAnd not having this black white polarization that we often try to make today how\nWorried are you David about\nThe level of anger now [noise]\nLevel the anger is a real problem but what it what is derived from is is the bigger problem and the stereotypes and and and all these\nThings we really don't know each other and once you get to know each other and what you did this inter relational stuff like with millennials unlike with folks of other races and other groups once you start doing individual stuff that's where it breaks down\nAnd that's where you're able to demonstrate that you know what you thought about may or what you thought about this group is not accurate where individuals were made in God's image we have equality and we can get along great if we'll sit down and talk to what you're doing to your book Glen I'm an addicted outrage ... that's exactly it you you sit down and have conversations on bigger things\nSo real quick just one last gimme the six things that you say are these are the six urging steps\nTo sit there actually six or generic what we've got to do an immigration what we have to do in our relationship with Israel while we have to do with millennials what we have to do with the people of faith doing a terrible job right now is when people of faith or so we go through those six areas and\nLet me lose touch on Israel our relationship with Israel is pretty good it is right now you're concerned in the book about Christians are starting to become anti Semitic\nThey are becoming anti Semitic what has changed just last well we don't know the scriptures well anymore and that we have the highest level of biblical literacy of any generation American history\nAnd so we're ah we're seeing sixteen hundred anti Israel events a year on college campuses uh people don't know much about the Palestinians but they're told they're press people in Israel is doing it so we have a real\nIndividual turn against Israel and a lot of denominations are coming out against Israel denominations that used to be very pro Israel now you only yes absolutely absolutely\nYeah these are the more liberal churches though their their their water called mainstream the nomination so that so that that you know this kind of like the United Methodist Church yeah usa those so they had never been anti Israel before but now they are they're they're coming out and they're wanting to do to BBS kind of stuff to boycott the messenger and sanctions\nSo there is a growing anti Semitic movement among people of faith in America which is certainly a problem\nNow this administration is an ... job on restoring and it's just as if an absolutely amazed yeah but that doesn't solve the individual problems we have a college campuses and at churches and people have said\nDavid Barton and James Carlo the name of the book is this precarious moment six urging steps that will save you your family and our country we are at the edge of the cliff\nAnd as a as the the righteous among the nation's a woman that I met a in Poland a told me were you there David\nYou weren't there were I don't think on that trip I was ah and ah she said the right just didn't suddenly become righteous and they just refuse to go over the cliff with the rest of humanity\nThe righteous didn't suddenly become righteous they just refuse to go over the cliff with the rest of humanity we are at that cliff\nLearn to stand teach your family to stand this precarious moment available everywhere books are so thanks so much\nAlright from hurricanes to earthquakes cyberwarfare everything\nAmericans should have a plan for any kind of emergency it was not racism that stopped the United states from doing more in um Puerto Rico\nWasn't FEMA was out of money never in the history of America have we had six major disasters happen in a short period of months there were six there's NO PLAN for four or five natural disasters at once\nThat's what happened FEMA was out of money as they said at the end of that year they said everybody needs to prepare for themselves because we're not prepared for things like this great place to start is storing your own food left up to twenty five years you can build it up over time\nMy patriots supply is the ... are the people that if they helped me with my food storage and I remember being overwhelmed by it I don't

just talking about memory but let's talk about another thing that is a misunderstood or under utilized to\nYou know are gone last forgotten in American that's bravery\nI have no idea what Malcolm Gladwell political bent is I don't really care um I like him I think he's smart what he votes for I don't care I'm he could be conservative we could be liberal bill no again don't care\nBut let's let's just say maybe he's liberal maybe fifty fifty shot\nHe just came on this program\nAnd he talked to me about a portion of the Kavanaugh hearings\nWith out expressing either condemnation or support\nHe spoke about memory and how it applies to both Kavanaugh and Ford you know how dangerous that is for him\nBut if you were on the Glenn Beck program strike one\nYou talk to them about Kavanaugh's strike too you didn't say an opinion on Kavanaugh strike three you're out yeah I mean any whether what\nRegardless of his personal politics a lot of this listeners would be from the left\nUm and so you know but that's like but he doesn't care the ... well I can hear the care it's something that we need it is it something that we need people just being willing to be honest and and\nJust talking about just about what we we can talk about things without making everything about politics even though this story the reason why I had him on is because it's very ... today\nBut that's heated the podcast before cabinet yeah nothing to do had nothing to do with it and so when we talk now in light of this can we just talk about what you found on memory right because it's important but it's the reason why I honestly I Would listen\nTo him on Brian Williams yes because he's credible if you're a chill mad out came out and so I understand filtered did that I wouldn't you know it didn't ever but like Malcolm so credible because he's not doing he's actually looking for an answer right yeah and that's what I think it is so absent\nIn so many places right now I mean it's you know it's it you don't oh wait you're not always right um but\nIt it's okay to keep your principles and and maintain your arguments and and believe things are morally correct the way you do\nBut there's no reason why you can't entertain them be challenged by someone who has a different opinion I feel like that's what you know one of the things that's been interesting about the Kavanaugh thing is because the those on the left here and you know the prominent ones in the left have been so\n... I Want to use the technical term bonkers on the story so over the top so ridiculous and so many ways um it has taken it has increased you know enthusiasm for Republicans which will be something you'd expect\nBut it's also taking people who are already planning to vote and changing their minds towards the capital\nAnd that is something just because I don't even know if it's because of details of these stories it's because one side looks unhinged and the other one does that is what you talked about them in our one today\nIs the point of addicted to outrage and this cabinet or the hearing and the way the Republicans and Donald Trump of played it is perfect is perfect it is the plan in addicted outrage Iran works at\nAll right All right let me ask you\nWell let me set this up and then they'll me what you say All right\nI watch the last ... when they were going to vote it vote him out to go to the floor and where I Know you've been talking about Booker ... add this king\nI really support us okay go ahead\nKing\n... partners okay go ahead but\nHe made this statement right before he got his little ball and he is the name plate laugh the room he said I was in senator flying than though is when she got out of four letter\n[laughter] yes the pretty thoroughly ... they're All right\nOkay so did he know mad the letter to\nYeah I I mean etiquette is really clear I thank you for your phone call um and it's a kind of like talking to Lindsey Graham [laughter] I'm a ... ... you know it's obvious that this leak came from somebody I personally think\nThe ah you know the the authorities should should look into the leak I think it's really rotten\nWhat ah what happened to Ford\nWelcome to the program thank you could you know you hear it it really it it it it really is you and I we can just say that no and you can't think of any other place could you know that I'd rather be yeah no so your experience with cabinet because we went into this last night on the news\nAnd why it matters if even if you miss last night's broadcast the news and why it matters you should listen to it because uh\nThere was quite an expose a\nReally nice here I Believe ... violations yay yay or less yeah night before last starting ... ... ... and you notice depressed ever picked up on it you\nKnow I Know I went to yeah they don't they don't care yeah a when this happened to particularly\nMen writing can then men on the right right they don't care they don't care and I I'm not going to go into it here but you were there were there I was you know it I was so\nWell we live very near a Yale for three years\nAnd I went to ... you went to Yale yeah so um so and so the cabinet and I distinctly remember\nYeah oh I don't even want to bring it yeah don't even I wouldn't\nIt July I have a a a fan in my uh bathrooms\nYou know when you turn on the light of my bathrooms I have a fan there yeah every every but because of of that memory but anyway [noise] so what are you [laughter]\nSo what are you delete 'em ... so uh so it was just code so [laughter] so [laughter] so I'm pat\nWhat's on your mind today a well of course Kavanaugh is on my mind he's always on my mind never far from my thought is uh and uh\nI it's it's fascinating to see how are you know just kind of outlined how the Democrats wanted investigation got one wanted it expanded still got a ... a wanted it delayed so it was and now now that it's all been done and\nWe're wrapping up and they found nothing now they want even more investigation and when we just ever end\nI think in two thousand twenty is when they went in if you if you are yeah I let him continue this process but ah\nThe latest thing from the roommate who knows who knows for a fact that cabinet was lying about his drinking habits and those words in his year book in high school ...\nDo bring them up uh I don't do bro don't bring up\nThe word no do booth do sell Fritz by and devil's triangle don't ... she 'cause you know what those are about obviously ... they're a well at least his roommate knows that they were a sexually charged words mhm which would make a huge difference in whether he should be a Supreme Court justice forty years\nLater if he was heading terms that were about ... he asked the Supreme Court ... then it's OK yeah as a teenager right as a teenager dangerous don't do that no only the networks reckless heinous serial killers they usually start to show signs of serial killing ... around sixty\nYeah that's usually what happens most serial killers are and I think we talked about this the other day do you guys are you familiar with the word moved 'cause I've yet to be millionaire with that and it's yeah it's pretty widely understood to be\n... it's interesting bomb three of us off is a different thing yeah all three of us had no fan of uh recollections of what that word meant India might actually was the sexual use I remember was that both yea or boss\nBoth boss I think both sides both would be really\nWho you know it's kind of OJ ... but like Glenn had a a drug reference yeah and I thought maybe I'm wrong\nBut I looked it up and they are big area and it is it's also a drug reference and then pat ... bought yeah was the farting thing yeah which is amazing I mean I honestly when I read that I was like ... he's probably trying to cover for himself because in my thought\nThat is actually what it was it was like a sexual term but then I ... I mean we all three of us yeah people have different recollection of a different area right different schools where a different backgrounds different you know I mean like that so it could mean anything they really could not get triangle I never heard of I don't know what that is yeah\nI don't know what that is well let me explain [laughter] ah but\nThe way the way everybody cares about this stuff when and I think you guys mentioned the certainly in the show when there was a president who admitted to far worse than this stuff\nNo nor worse then we don't have it on tape and if we did have it on tape gonna lay it right now\nI think I was a thug [noise] for a for a big part of my growing up I I I was I think I was a\nVery typical uh uh uh getting rapists areas [noise] a mischievous child as a as a young boy\nI just think I'm by the time I was an adolescent and moved back from Indonesia and was struggling with\nThese issues of a racial identity and the father not being in a way what straw racially Tennessee I think that a ... you know I reacted by a by engaging and a lot of uh uh that that's not a typical\nWhite males\nAre across the country ... ... with that\nI played a lot of basketball stereotypes of black male or buy a ...\nThan take school that's seriously watch ... that's what all I got into fights Wang was to play a black on black male drank drank a he drank totally different than white who are consumed substances that are where we were legal yeah not a legal\nUm uh and I think\nGenerally pretty away it was a yeah acting out in ways in ways that when I look back on it I understand uh you know the next day and it got me through those years was was\nUm [noise] a natural aptitude for ... or not I didn't have to pay attention too much into my grades as soon as\nHe goes on to say or think you know it takes too long [laughter] he goes on to say that he would drink a six pack in the hour before class yeah and in and out on a soapbox but I don't go to the last drunk yeah I mean nobody cared about that stuff\nNo no no more about it and by the way where was that stuff when he was running where was that right where what we have to we have to have an ... calendars ha ha but uh this guy has that the press\nDid it and no one in the press and they would be a right to not do it would would hear that and ...\nI eat to not do it would would hear that and say oh well he ... he's look at look at his temperament I mean he was right he admitted to fights he admitted to fights he admitted to chugging beers with our emitting an illegal activity his temperament\nThey would've never set that which is more important he is there's only one executive cabinet I was going for ... a position where he's won nine of the court far more important for the one guy you know to be able to have that this position to be able to have that temperament and be able to have that\nJob you're like here's why here's why because he's not white\nAnd he's fighting the patriarchy that is the real reason why it does matter\nIf you're fighting the patriarchy and the white in\nThe history of colonialism and I know this sounds ridiculous but read the book\nIt's post modern is\nIf you are doing that did you see the did you see the the um the the bogus studies they were just published demise read that amazing hugging credible we haven't even talked about we have to talk about it tomorrow um these studies where they where these these three I'm a scientist\nRealize this post modern stuff is crap and it's changing science and it's completely unhinged so they started writing papers to see if they could get them peer reviewed unpublished\nThey wrote papers about how the rape culture is really even fostered in dog parks because dogs\nWill help each other and that the one dog will be a traumatized and the other dog didn't ask permission and uh it's it's just\nPerpetrating a rape culture in America it published and it was an award winning essay and it was totally made up in bogus okay wow that's how insane", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "College Station", "day": "04"}
