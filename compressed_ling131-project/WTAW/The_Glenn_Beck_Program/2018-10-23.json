possessed by a gym [laughter] I mean you know this is\nThe thing we were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday talking about nationalism\nAnd what the definition of nationalism in its history is is at times very disturbing lane um however you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing the really bad examples of nationalism as an as where we are trying to go if you're Donald Trump or not they would want to be like those terrible countries\nHe seems to be referring to it as like look we're the best country and would you morale Roddick and we regret the best you know culture and he went and we should be\nA you know patriotic and and and be ... up you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you when you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I kind of saying that because you've probably been possessed by a gym or go this is the gym tolerated and now it's a different kind of June ... was that I've had a lot of of\n... or in my life I got to say it's trouble yeah it it gets you into job believe it in the ... of it all adds up ...\nSixty shots of beer on a program recently alive on the air right can be an issue but I think I'm OK thing that a culture that embraces women as equals is superior to a culture that that puts them but won't let them drive and and forces them to address a specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that I mean they\nArrange emails or alter but those are all just social construct\nIt maybe it's just a good social ... sometimes things are built and they're good to know the good piece of can no you're not you're not from the west not from the west which brings me back to the caravan when we come back\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away\nAnd I want you to listen to all of the people on television that are now saying we are a country that has always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our values\nOr have always our greatest strength is our tolerance and are welcoming spirit\nReally is coming from the left because I've always felt\nThat way but you always told me that we have a rape culture not a tolerance culture\n... ... ... ... I've always thought we welcomed immigrants in but eat you'll always told us that we have anything that is foreign\nI've always believed that our our laws reflected a nation of immigrants but you'll have always said that our laws are racist and a half from the beginning ban a system of oppression so which is it which is it how can you tell me\nThat we've always been a country that is welcoming immigrants and our laws are set up as a nation of immigrants and yet telling me that we are the most depressive monstrous society ever that only embraces that rape culture\nYou can't have it both ways which are we\nAre we a are we a\nCountry that is that embraces a a rape culture\nOr as or as any rational\nNon Marxist post modernist might say\nAre we a little of both\nAre we are we a country that tries to be this way and sometimes we fail\nTo see you can't really say that because then you can throw the baby and the bath water out\nWhich is why we've been saying hey baby is a good thing the bath water may need to be changed but let's not throw the baby out too and that's having your argument the radicals\nThose who don't believe in any kind of border security at all your the one leading the charge that we do all this land\nThis land doesn't belong to us\nThat were all afraid because we're white people and white people are bad\nAnd now you're on TV saying that we've always had this culture that welcomes immigrants wealthy [noise] um [noise] it is true\nWe've always had a culture that has welcomed immigrants we are a nation of immigrants but we have also felt that you've always needed to come here and not want to dismantle us\nThat you came here because [noise] because you saw the American dream\nAnd most immigrants do most immigrants seeing the American dream and they've come from someplace else you noticed these guys are coming from Honduras they're not stopping in Mexico why\nThey would probably have an easier life in Mexico just blending in they speak the language why why would you come to America and why not just walk through America up to Canada they've got free health care\nThinking that\nThey have all kinds of his anti hate laws and speech laws there are progressive utopia they have free universal healthcare why not just marched through us and go to Canada\nBecause one of two things either Canada is not the beacon\nAmerica is for all those who are the poor and the tired and the huddled masses\nOr this is a political move\nAnd you're not going to Canada because it's not about you your life the job\nIt's a political move it's to destabilize to help push a country over the edge now I don't know which one it is but I Do know this\nSeventy five hundred people coming across our border in mass is not helpful and shouldn't happen you lose control\nOf

of this guy and they're just land and planes and Sea Tac the tower is saying hey guys guys guys wait a minute wait a minute what are you doing can't land here can't land here would you be okay with that\n\nOr would you think that might cause chaos and might be dangerous what'd you think that if Sea Tac airport cannot control the skies if they lose control of their airport they're not really an airport\nWhy does that work for an airport but it doesn't work for a country we lose control of our borders\nAnd people are just coming whenever they want and they can just get a big huge mass of people because of Seventy five hundred people can do it surely they can get twenty thousand\nAnd they will try twenty thousand and they will work and if you let them through congratulations\nYou're

I guess her tone wasn't acceptable to Alyssa\nOr but I mean you know she has a very fair question it was a woman who is supporting an ideology in a movement that is a brutal to women all over the world much worse than uh the certainly much worse than what you know these than sorry did or Louis the K did or in or the founders\nOr or the owners were so oppressive really have you seen Sheree along yeah it's\nNot not good ah so I mean I just it's a totally fair question and the fact that they continue to embrace when to start stories the door and say hey you know once you bring to the table you know she's just the I guess you just crossed that line if you're going to be radical and you'll stand up and you'll keep saying radical thing they will embrace you no matter what\nI remember we did something years and years ago about why the um the sar soars and the key thousands were brought into the movement a and it was a decision to ah make sure you didn't lose the Islamic vote in the future so they went out\nAnd they found it I'm not saying that those two but they went out and they found\nYou know connections to the Islamic community and brought them in and gave them positions are inside to make sure that we we lock up the Islamic vote and so that's at least how they got in\nIs they were saying well we have\nTo have a broader tent we have to have a very big tent no no you really know now with people who are saying ... yeah no you're outside the tent\n... really comes down to the media has not held the movement accountable remembers is someone who you know and I because there's so many victims of really terrible things sometimes that occurs but it's more than that it's ideology\nYou know and one of the founders of the me too movement or what has shown that she also had a accusations against her from a and she did sleep with a very young cast made in one of her movies\nShe was dating a Anthony Bourdain we now know obviously killed himself later on but with at the time uh CNN employee paying off the person who was making the accusation\nI think that I mean it's amazing to me that no one has said that contribute to his death\nI I've had the same thought\nI mean it's you know in you know look suicide is unreasonable so you're not in your mind when you commit suicide but there are things that um\nThat that can be so disjointed\nIn your head that you can never sold for them you can never repair them if if he is at CNN and he really does believe in the me too movement and he really believes he's on the right side and he's having to go to work with a bunch of journalists who say you know we gotta throw these guys away and look they all do that\nAnd his girlfriend has done it to a guy a kid and he's now paying a bribe to shut him up that concert that internal conflict in an unhealthy person has got to the GOP to play a role\nIn his suicide as to\nNobody's willing to look at that\nI don't know if you if you're a psychiatrist [noise] called me and tell me how I'm wrong on that but that cognitive dissidents\nTo have played a major room or at least a big role\nHis uh you know settlements in court that could have been done months ago you know they're they're just they're all set with him now there are many of those things didn't work out yeah so they moved down to something which is intriguing there'll be at the Planned Parenthood setting up his office I'm sure soon\nI'm sure I'm sure he's got to go someplace listen to this and this is the way the media does these things right now George Soros reportedly had an explosive device in his mailbox or over overnight mhm which needless to say but we should say it anyway\nOver overnight mhm which needless to say but we should say in any way\nIs a horrific idea if anyone were ever to do that and you are an awful person in every respect or if you were to be responsible for such and other days for the rest for\nMy entire life up until last five or six years\nI Would say it it goes beyond saying that this shouldn't happen\nBut now you have to you you've got to because if you don't say that well what does he look he was condoning it\nYeah and and beyond that goes to what we're talking about yesterday with Nancy Pelosi harassing Nancy Pelosi well she's out in the street these are terrible terrible ideas heroin you'll be the left don't do the things they're doing we've seen that the left has been violent or ask people who are playing baseball this congressional baseball game\nOr you know we've seen that before we've seen uh the harassment of officials in places I Would much rather have the on our argument\nA ... as as in our repertoire of argument that we're not we're not the ones doing that they are so don't plan to that I I Know no one in this audience would ... and we have no idea by the way who did this I mean I certainly the speculation is is a church service opponent\nUm you know someone on the on the right but I mean it would be his wife I'm just saying we have no idea who it is right\n[laughter] um but listen to this coverage from the New York times now look I get that they are liberal I get it\nAnd I understand that they're not going to look at George Soros may be the same way that I Do and I was just to the point of like you checked out mentally know write up a piece of a story that says this come on\nThough Mr ... name has become a trigger for a subset of Republicans and conservatives but right off the bat you're just condescending right it's not that he's done anything you could possibly disagree right trigger a name and forget there several countries\nHave named him an enemy of freedom not like I'm In rural poor people but like they pass laws against [laughter]\nYeah it is a subset you know it's just about six countries have ... named him in it you know a a a danger to their freedom in a band any of his money you know from coming into the country\nBut that's just a small subset so how do you have any country [laughter]\nIt was a ... you know ... and the work trigger thank God it's normally ... conservative and say like some uh students here's a word they don't like and they go hide in a safe space that they were triggered right and like it's a condescending term again\nFor a talk show host for ... for Huffington Post blogger in lying to us on sort of like for the New York times did they uh the Mr sources name as a as a trigger a\n... for a subset of Republicans conservatives\nThis is this is how the airport and who he is a\nHe has said that his main goal is a political activist was to see a return of bipartisanship [laughter]\nYou know the ... world do you have to believe that the court to everybody says they want bipartisanship\nGeorge Soros is that a bipartisan figure he is one of the largest donors in the history of the Democratic party and he ... he launched a foundation that is funneled money to every crazy left wing calls on the planet but we're supposed to without question\nThere is not like an argument the only thing we hear from conservatives are triggered by his name\nWhat's his name George so very sorry it's it's so it's just happens sometimes\nHe said it's you know it's a crazy is you know who's more bipartisan the Koch brothers totally further yeah they're they're they're not conservatives they're libertarian which\nMeans they give to both sides sometimes they're on this side sometimes they're on that site foreign socialist on social issues almost exclusively with them or they're not conservative now and yet they're not bipartisan they're evil\nIt's ... it's in comprehensive coverage let's do this on this is from uh New York times as well this is their story about how anatomy does not determine gender experts say that's a headline\nLet me just say that again but it would you say that again and now he does not determine gender experts say God and now this is of course to push back on Trump's policy to use biological sex as a as the ... factor and and I guess you don't get to just make it up anymore\nI'm ... I mean listen to this and I read this several times ... and it's actually changed and meaning as I've read it but listen to this\nHow do you define identity researchers say gender identity comes from the brain not the body\nSome put it more bluntly it originates between your ears not between your legs now what they seem to to be describing there is something different than we're describing what they're describing is a feeling\nRight like I feel like I'm a woman now you can feel like you're a woman I Believe ...\nAt one point felt like a woman\nAnd I'm actually still doubts I assume she does fluid but it's ... who knows a but like I just say that you feel that way is almost in a in a in a in a roundabout sort of way a criticism of transgender as I'm right we're a conservative would say you're not transgendered you just feel like you're a transgender that's a different thing\n... that is what it is that would be in the ceiling\nWhich used to be called if I'm not mistaken gender ... for ya and any that feeling it was a was categorized by\nMedical scientists as something that was harmful to your mental\nHealth right but I was there and and and certainly there are cases like that or where at least there used to be that there were admitted as a as a you know a real problem with in in mental health however there are other cases to wear like for example we use the term tomboy\nRight for a girl who\nSeem to like to do a lot of the things that boy did maybe acted like a boy a little bit and you call that person tomboy you didn't call them a an actual\nBoy was it was a nickname for someone who was a girl but acted like a boy and I guess my question here would be if it's true gender comes from the brain not the body or into originates between your ears not between your legs\nWhy do they have surgery why do why do they change what is between their legs if it has nothing to do with what between their legs why these two things associated all they seem to be talking about a collection of personality attributes right like\nI like I like sports I like you know I like action movies I like you know giant and prime rib eye have generally issues at our interests that are with the male therefore I'm male they're talking about male interests or something\nYou know who will be able to explain this who's then be able to make sense one way or another explain both sides is a doctor Deborah so\nYes she be great let's call her up have her own tomorrow because I'd like an explanation of\nWhy bother getting your gender those changed if it's got nothing\nTo derive genitals and isn't that just gender this for a a and haven't we at times said that's bad what research has shown us that it's not bad\nBecause suicide rate remains the same\nWe we've ... we've said this what this was bad because the genders foray leaves all kinds of different things and general unhappiness\nThat's because the genders foray leads to all kinds of different things and general unhappiness okay so what research said that if we say that it's not bad and we go through with surgeries and everything that it will lead to a different outcome\nAnd I think that's an important piece of it I mean I think the outcomes are not all that positive\nBut beyond that whether the outcome is good or bad there is truth there is no I don't know like I don't understand like the word gender meant sex organs forever mhm okay\nAnd if you want it instead of changing the word gender ... to mean something new\nThen instead say okay actually this is an interesting a personality trait base the they seem to see themselves as a man and and isn't that interesting and they can do what they what they want I have no interest in what they're doing to themselves\nOr from a perspective from a libertarian perspective I think it's not what but like there is also a fact earlier\nSo let's get into this tomorrow because the fact on gender when you say well used to be sex well yeah it used to mean sex but it doesn't now and the guy who changed it was a psychopath yeah oh yeah and uh we'll we'll start with that and let's see if we can get a doctor so on tomorrow's\nProgram to go over [noise] All right my patriotism life\nWhat do you think is going to happen the stock market is down four hundred and forty five points right now uh it's had a it's been it's been pretty bad lately what happens if the Democrats take control of Congress and we have seven thousand people on our border\nWhat do you think happens or what do you think the economy is like next year [noise]\nAnd it's pretty bad may I suggest a that we are just in the same fragile position that we have been for a long time it just gets spooky spooky here we are just right on that edge I Hope we don't go over the edge but I Will tell you I have my family prepared to do you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "College Station", "day": "23"}
