[noise]\nWell a lot of social justice warriors were excited when they heard that Whitey had died yesterday but a different Whitey this was the mob guy I'm Whitey Bolger he was eighty nine years old found unresponsive yesterday at eight twenty in the morning\nHe had been in custody since Monday they were transferring him they moved in from a prison in Florida are and how to stop in Oklahoma City before moving to West Virginia\nHe was attacked by three men in the general population sector of the prison or one of the men used to lock tucked into a sock as a weapon said Dr seuss thing for I mean ... is our wean Dr seuss we should write that anyway\nUh and then the group attempted to gouge his eyes out\nOkay I mean you know why I'm John Johnson but everyone around here likes to go to Nancy\nA so this guy is eight and ... by the way the guy killed him what a surprise a mob it man I'm at least that's who they think guys and the tourists a legend in the ... world here's a clip from a documentary about him\nBut he's just staring at me in just grinding his teeth you kill you owe stabbing and then I'll kill you don't like holy\nTo my team and kill ball just if you want to one of my head and shoulders\nVery people they're very people there and he went to sleep there\nThey were over twenty five years where LBJ or ruled the organized crime while he was never charged with even a misdemeanor\nWhitey Bolger this hospital maximum life in prison\nThis isn't really a typical criminal trial this is a lot about getting where they don't you want to know what really went on [noise]\nIs a government excited about having Bolger comeback some people certainly are but there are others who have many sleepless nights about what James ... just going to testify to\nThat question I get the money [noise]\nThis is from a documentary great documentary called Whitey United States of America versus a James Jay Bolger the director is job earlier and he's on with this now Hi Joe how are you\nAre you good for me\nUh so so for people who don't follow a Whitey ... give us that give tell his story\nA it's a it's a long and complicated tale but in a nutshell a you know he uh ran south Boston in a neighborhood called south the and over a twenty five year period he basic\nIt's called ... and over twenty five year period he basically was allowed to kill with impunity and as we later found out he was um you know\nAllowed to be an informant for the FBI or the FBI's mandate in the eighties was to bring down the mafia are and to do that they used Whitey and some of his associates or as informants and which in and of itself\nIs okay but they then turned a blind eye you know when you're an informant for the federal government it's not a license to kill a and uh he was he was allowed to basically run roughshod over the streets of south Boston or he had a strange hold over the neighborhood as well\nWhat was it that it practice due to the story why why did you make the film and what did you what attracted you to it and what did you take away from it\nYeah I mean I thought that ah you know\nBolger finally bring being brought to trial because there's there's such a myth about the guy there such folklore [noise] you know\nIn our society ... unfortunately we tend to glamorize it erodes out of criminals are Bolger probably is the greatest example of that so much folklore surrounding him so much hero worship um films that kind of\nDownplay the grizzly side of or the or the aftermath of of what he's responsible for even if it does show the details\nOf how people are killed you know we we celebrate criminals in this society which is\nWhich is an odd phenomenon and so the idea that he was being brought\nBack to trial finally the face the music I thought would be a great opportunity there kind of separate fact from fiction and to really understand the crimes that that was my going in assumption\nBut sitting through that trial and witnessing it and getting to know Bolger are in fact I was the only journalist allowed to actually interview him because the defense attorneys basically trusted me versus some other journalists in part because of my previous worn films like Paradise Lost\nUm uh you know what fascinated\nMe and ... and what my big turn was was just how ... the government has been in allowing a killer to run roughshod over the streets of Boston\nAnd how you know he is informant you know if you're going to allow somebody to evade justice for twenty five years you would hope that the record of\nWhat you got what he what you got out so rock solid and I so points to like oh my God this guy was invaluable but I ... the evidence was just not there for me you know he was it was in ... he was in the logbook says as being an informant\nBut you know if you really drill into it there's very little information that\nThe feds didn't already have and so then the question is why was he allowed and even if he gave the best information on the planet and is directly responsible for the end of the mafia in New England as we know it which was not the case um ... you still have to\nQuestion you know ... of the government allowing somebody like that to commit murder and they knew it\nJoe ...

some reason George Soros is being rehabilitated again in the press a and\nNow they're ... they're taking it so far by saying that\nUm people are saying this caravan a is a is now being funded with Jewish money\nAnd when they said Jewish money what they're actually saying is George Soros they're saying that people said that George Soros is funded this but to make it sound more anti Semitic they're saying people are claiming that this is now being funded with Jewish money\nSo who's the anti Semite here who's the one line\nFirst of all this caravan we have absolutely no evidence that George Soros is involved in this or any of his money is going to fund or support any of this we have zero information\nWe do have information that two of the uh uh organizations that he helps fund were directly responsible for the last\nCaravan in April\nBut probably next week we're going to go through a the puppet master and I'll bring you the absolute facts\nBecause the media has gone insane

front I mean that's crystal knock\nThey can't even call those people I'm a mob and so we ... it comes to us to set the record straight will do that next week on George Soros ...\nFrom that was making

hundred and Ninety thousand dollars a foreigner Ninety million dollars over like five years well the companies shipped out the first\nUm turbine but the company was told by China hey we need to see everything we need to we need to know every step of the way what's going on what they did is they got access to the servers they hacked in they downloaded everything they got one generator\nThan they cancelled they said yeah we're good will they found out that\nChina had hacked in got all of the blueprints everything they had they had one that they were made by Americans and they brought it into their factories and said okay just make a bunch of these\nThat's what they're doing to us all the time to me that's not a trade the problem [laughter]\nI mean depending on what ... ... ah information you're accessing it's an act of war I mean it can\nBe they have access to our power grid they have access to I mean I'm telling you if we ever go to war\nIt's going to be lights out that these China and Russia this is what well boot and said World War three will be fought with ones and zeroes not bombs and China is doing the same exact thing so why don't we do more about this [noise] I think probably because we\nOwe China's so much money nobody wants to make an enemy of China nobody wants to say anything we probably do some of this stuff not stealing things but I'm sure we are trying to hack into into their military as well so I think it's one of those things where\nYou know everybody's listening to each other right you know so let's not talk about it will all deny it but we all know\nWhat China is a different animal China is is the\n... the largest transfer of wealth in human history\nHas happened in the last ten years and it's all fast from China what they have stole from our corporations the plans are the ideas what they have taken from our our corporations and our country\nIs the largest transfer of wealth in human history and it's all ill gotten goods\nRoute so that that separate from that's separate from their rules like so China has a\nVery restrictive rules in their country\nAnd they these are these are non tariff barriers rhyme mind which basically say hey you want the access to our ... billion and a half people access to this market or you're gonna have to do when you come over here is give us access to your technology\nAnd willingly ... corporations do this all the time they go over there and they say well I mean I Want to have access to the market so I guess you could have it\nThat's a ... a terrible policy\nBy choice but also this that he should do it they did it this theft\nThis is them getting in like the wind turbine mhm okay getting in a having a basic\nAccess okay we're going to buy these will buy 'em for four hundred and Seventy
