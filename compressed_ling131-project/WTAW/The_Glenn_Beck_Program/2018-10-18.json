without any basis whatsoever another problem with this is the teachers the people that are paid to be here are committed to the same thing with us\nLast week superintendent Clark elite talked about the return of random tests on our show\nWe want kids quite frankly I got to have a reason to say no and if the marching band is important to them with a basketball team or any of those activities that are extra curricular in nature that they want to be involved with than this gives them a reason to say no to go to that party or to or do whatever a on a friday or Saturday Night\nThe school board brought back random drug tests following request from the athletic director of consolidated in College Station high schools a combination of factors is credited with a drop in discipline issues and

you're going to carve a punk and what are you going to do with the guts when you're done see well you can either take your seed listen to you yeah man I met in the past high end air ...\nAir ... no ... no but see that's the deal this now does that you have to understand we need to recycle when you'd use all food we need to use everything that ...\nNow there is to just put 'em out I don't know like in the yard and we want to feed the birds we take care of horses goes that goes into jello and what we do is you know now ... cars that compare um you have such a way with words and ... so on appetizing\nDo you like sunflower seeds yes how are you going to ruin those Serino pumpkins or just right\nDo you like sunflower seeds yes Hi Gail where are you going to ruin those furry no pumpkins or just writes hundred degrees forty five minutes\nI have had I had that pumpkins hardest part is cleaning them from the ... good point\nGood point there's pumpkin juice punk and you know uh if you're in the juices in smoothies here ... makes up for a healthier dishes if you want to get to use the guy you could do that when you compare it with apple cider and some spices and make a good drink okay

Tulsa with olive oil and sprinkle liberally with some kosher salt in any other spices you want to\nOrange trees for half an hour or ... or you could just let out your inner child and have a food fight with the punk and\n... that might be pretty good so I think that's a that's a shame to do everything to the whole time can no reason to throw it away no reason to do the right are men's reaction\nTime peaks at the age of thirty nine scientists elevated men are evaluated been from a twenty three two eighty on a finger tap reaction found that the reaction time is best at the age of thirty nine so maybe something for you to look forward to or something and say\nWell I've ... I hardly missed out on this so orange is the new black gone oh really ... canceled yes are you missing it now and okay you get it was canceled his ... well yeah I got a lot of talk last year especially got a lot of trouble yeah\nI watched I I guess like the first four seasons or possibly and then um yeah I mean I've I've started the fifth season but I just can't I just yeah now I have that same deal nominate isn't it I Will\nSay though I you know I I had picked back up they said the U.S right and I watched the season finale of season too so they are currently in season thirty so I just finished up season to last night\nAnd I think I remember why I don't watch it very much as I cry during an episode yeah there you go that's what I don't get why don't people one man in Crimea is so good it's got a lot of good feelings\nTo route if it if it is and you know that's the other thing is they're ... they're not all ... that a lot of them [laughter] and he says well written and ... so so well written ... or\nThings that you guys watch the game last night the baseball game now okay well I didn't know if you all had any thoughts on that are at play\nThey get it right on interfering in what what has who is this fans don't they need to get rid of the fans didn't kick him out\nThe chronicle was on it they had already gone down and like talk to the guy run after it happened and they didn't kick him out\nBut it would have been a two run home run instead Jose all to be called out and guess what they asked us lose by kids who are why did not the way to kick him out say sir you're an idiot your goal so I I think I guess from Houston perspective they think that maybe\nIf they kicked him out that would be admitting that he in fact did reach over um duty\nI think he did well are you from the angles but there is one fan who's got his hand\nOver the kids you know yeah the wall and the yellow line on top and he's got his hand over the wall oil inside a play and he's reaching over he's not reaching behind him and I don't think he's reaching immediately to his right he's reaching powered yeah and so he he's there and then there are several other fans are there yeah I think they did barely reached over in the field of play\nWhat kind of an ... what kind of an\nIdiot wants to inject themselves into the it's just it's reaction you know which is not you don't think so no okay\nWhen it clears the fence that's one thing but if you to reach over is just that's that's just yeah\nWell in ... and somebody brought it up how about moving the fans back you up you know there are two or three you know oh that's a little by little you've gotta you've gotta space and ... of course you know I follow a lot of ... and and people that are fans of the strode than that no way that their opinions about by it but there are plenty of other people too that believe that\nUh you know it wasn't fan interference because a fan if the ball is in the stands the ban can touch it\nRight it's just if a player I mean if a player goes in the stands and say a band hits his glove but the glove is in the stands then that's on interference because that's the fans domain right but if a fan reaches out over the bill to play and touches it and it's hard to tell from the angle but I I think they\nDid so I'm going to agree with Zach on their reaction thing I think that when you're a fan and you see a ball coming to you at least some people's reaction is to catch it or try to catch it now you have\nTo be mindful if that's where you're sitting but obviously in that split second that guy is not thinking he's not being mindful and um I Do think from what I've seen on replays and on Twitter and and what not like the video and that the the photos\nI think they made the right call but it was really close well now that\nGuy's gonna have to live with ruining the lives of twenty seven multi millionaires on that baseball no I Hope we can learn with that\nWell they still got I was in game seven yeah they're not out there and it was their first getting there so toast\nThey're so done that's crazy [noise] for the given up fourteen runs in the last two games that about right something like that I ah yeah long runs yes sixteen run right so there are just so you um so after\nYears of blurry vision a one hundred and two year old woman in China so she finally decided to undergo surgery because it was affecting her ability to play video games\nI Know now it's not for knife is the or call of duty okay uh I'm not\nEven Angry Birds that she's played uh-huh hardcore solitaire ... says two thousand and two she's been having trouble playing because the her cat around so now that arise size better the hundred and two year old has been told she can play your favorite video game for up to thirty minutes at a time\nOh wow man her yeah if you're if you're going to you know if you had the money or you had the means and and that's what makes you happy go for it\nYou're supposed to have two elevators but when you have one elevator then it means you have to wait and then you have to ride on the elevator with people who have to stop at other place\nI get Florida actually I don't understand that at all white ham folks\nYeah they are you trying to be nice I mean do you do you want to wait and then let people get on and off and then they chitchat and then the doors close slowly\nThat either the coming here to the stairwell it is kind of creepy yeah well that is true 'cause life don't come on if if nobody's walk by and preserved motion sensors\nUm but you know like folks granted Scott was coming home from a long hard day's work at three hours\nBut for us you know we're coming we're coming down the elevator and folks are have already pressed the button like on the third or second floor tired of waiting right and so then they just leaving it ends up stopping there but there's nobody to to get on the elevator with understand well anyway\nWe we've got an uh taking care of and inducted Beck is here now and uh so we understand that good morning doctor how are you getting morning thanks for being with us sorry about the scourge of one elevator but that happens every once in a once a technological a problem force are are you a Houston Astros than I Am I'm a little bomb you're watching it last night\nI did watch some of it or did you see the interference call did not OK er and while I was going to ask your opinion I didn't see it I was gone and we were discussing it earlier and uh you know fans will keep their hands and you know in in the out of the field of play as far as I'm\nYes it ended up being a ... a game changer\nDid so anyhow we got that are going to have good morning and thank you for spending some time with us up I bought a recap a couple of things we've done news stories on first of all you know one of the things he essentially says something that you put in place and um it seems like you're getting some benefits pretty quickly on this\nWe are and the central ages to remind everyone has a\nIt's a partnership it's an initiative\nThat we created Brian ISD homegrown we didn't buy it we developed it and we did that collaboratively with our teachers and we're just real excited about it we we\nHand selected eight traits that we believe that making life ready and we want all of our students to you know and to model as well as are adults and so we started the year off\nWith um that after on all of our teachers received in a full day of training\nAt this summer but we started with kindness during the month of August and September\nAnd now we moved into tolerance for October so Scott remind you that means desiring to understand and accept others it's part of the challenge was to make definitions find the definitions that were simple enough but yeah meaningful and asked for kids to relate to\nPull it again like anything else they learn to school at the parents are aware of and can do a little support when when the kids get home it it helps\nTo wet Texas is really um internationally in the news today because of a a state senator Royce West of legislation that he wrote that there will be sixteen minute video that each student much watch before they graduate from high school about how to interact with police officers and\nAnd uh what is your thought about that and what games can we get sources can say\nWell I'm I haven't actually seen that this morning really did not watch the news on my ... getting up and getting ready to morning which I normally do ... and I will have to educate myself on that specifically I think\nThe purpose is you know anecdotally we find out from police officers or constable or sheriff's deputies whatever it is\nHow you should behave when you stop by a member of law enforcement because now there's video cameras there that can help capture the situation make you aware of it but now senator West is asking well the legislation is that you cannot graduate\nUntil you have viewed the sixty minute video and the teachers will have background material and I believe a sophomore starting sophomore classes when they want to introduce this what are your thoughts on that\nMy thoughts are that that goes really on hand in hand with a few of the initiatives that we've developed from our safety task force\nAnd one of those is cops shops meaning that we are trying to create a positive environment for officers both sheriff's officers\nDeputies brand pd to enter our school's walk through maybe grab a cup of coffee were trying to work with I've got a lot of parents interested in how can we provide some snacks meals\nFor them to stop maybe do a report but do it on our premises and then they have it increased presence and so um to me that goes hand in hand with a moving away from that fear of the police but knowing that in most cases police are there to help us and uh that's certainly the relationships I see our\nSchool resource officers building in our schools certainly have those in all of our campuses fifth grade enough and rolling in our elementary and so it's important that they have a positive that they're there to help\nFor duct Christie what Beck joined us the superintendent of the ISD 'em to that to that point then and of course respect for authority is something that that that needs to be taught and they they need to understand it should be confrontational situation\nBut return on investment is like anything else in in education a Hearst Newspapers in Houston Chronicle read a story a couple of weeks ago where we have a grading system in for any number of reasons they're people who are unhappy with and understand why we're going to a grading system what they do is they looked at schools that had received A's and B's and the Houston area\nYet they found that there were a high percentage of students who had to take remedial classes once they got into college\nAnd the numbers they had for for instance the ... school district we're we're pretty discouraging and that they had about forty percent of those kids who had to take some sort of remedial test you have any figures on what what kind of situation we have for the ISD graduates and what kind of remedial courses they might have to take as they start college\nI Do um I think when you look at that data though remember you're talking kind of apples and oranges so ratings are based on a compilation of as things mainly star scores but also graduation rates they're based on a college and career military readiness at the high school level\nWhen you look at that component that the article is speaking to a it's very heavily um how does a child do on the SAT or ACT so for example um for an SAT they needed to have I Believe it was a\nFour eighty on that now than at five thirty in the reading or vice versa I project on how the article in front of me shirts that say is and it has to be both\nOr vice versa I Apologize to her article in front of me shirt but say is and it has to be both so a student might be better at reading than they are in math and may fall ten points short of that on the first round of testing that doesn't mean that they're not college bound it just means that they may need to take that test again many parents actually a\nPurchase in and work on um ways to help them do better on those tests I Know I did with my students I put them through a little ... [laughter]\nAnd made them go through that little prep class to raise the scores so it varies and so you have to kind of keep in mind what is that piece of data rated on but when I'm looking at for Brian is um is data that we receive every district does\nOn the percentage of graduates in the Texas Institute of higher ed that complete one year of college without remediation gray and so it's a two year lab because they have to wait and see them follow through and all that so in two thousand Thirteen fourteen Brian graduates or that went on to attend college\nState average of needing remediation ah let's see without remediation was Seventy percent and Brian I esteem was Seventy six points ...\nThen in fourteen Fifteen state average was fifty five point six and Brian I assume it was sixty four\n... tell me what you think the I mean I don't want to build to foreigners statistics but if you go from Seventy percent of fifty five percent statewide that's a pretty precipitous drop as long as I Know I'm hearing that that's\nThat is correct on the state average but for Brian I see it for us it was again and it but it was a drop from the overall yes right I don't know why that would be across the board dot digging for\nThe interesting it'd be interesting to know that a ... million last week and what color station school district is doing it again measures measuring sticks or difficult and I know that you want to be able to measure accurately what\nColor stations doings are joined about fifty other districts to come up with the idea of community based assessment is that something to be all you do have some interested in it and how would you formulate\nThat well I think formally community based assessment I've been here a year and a half that has not been on the top of the radar in terms of my most important\nInitiative is it happening\nYes it is and the fact that we're looking to what does our community want from us as we go forward so for example right now have committees forming survey so we can actually assess our community and say what is important to you that we focus on and from that we'll build our twenty twenty five strategic plan out\nWhere are we headed and what do we want to do a the community based assessments as I understand that from the state they're great because they give you that\nHomegrown concept of what what does do our folks want but they don't take you away from the rest of what the state requires on all the accountability so you don't get to just substituted so to speak for that\nOne would you I mean you're saying twenty twenty five now that's I mean that's seven years from now do we want to have some do you want to have a community\nIs based assessment in place prior to that is there a time table that you would want to see that happen so to be I guess the students you could say this is what we the people in Bryan have told us we need our students to look like and be like and this is where we are based on those those funded\nWell the the term twenty twenty five is only a work backward or like where do we want to be where do we want to see the ice tea rated how what kind of problems do we want to have in place you work backward and you begin now you don't wait until then so yes I Do see those types of things but as far as a a community based um assessment\nMan a man of adding All right there you go buy a broadcast things they do not want to tell you the College Station Bryan [noise]\nPresident Trump is about to meet with the secretary of state I'm Dave Anthony Fox News the topic the presumed the murder of a journalist at the Saudi consulate Denise ... boxes Rachel Sutherland live in Washington\nThey shot the urgency diplomatic missions in Saudi Arabia and turkey secretary of state Mike Pompeo is set to have a long talk with President Trump about what may have happened to two mile ...

[noise]\nI'm Sorry man look here's the thing that's not cool maybe it was different in the nineties but today I think we're all understanding that there's a massive power imbalance between an intern and the president of the United states right I mean forget in trying to present with anyone as a power imbalance President Obama texted me I have trouble you up a [noise]\nI'd have to let him slash [noise] and then he'd be like I actually I just don't know if you're watching the game and I'll be like oh yeah I knew that I knew that of course I did yeah [noise] and also of course Henry trying to deflect and make this about Trump like you're not in a position to be throwing stones at someone Henry especially when you literally sitting in a glass house\nUm other than the power dynamics thing while he is saying there is is really amazing because nobody takes around like that on the left\nUm but I don't buy into the power dynamic that nobody can say ... or no to the president of the United states of course you could I mean don't you wouldn't you certainly tried to raise your children to grow up to the people that would say no different than the United states yes absolutely yeah you don't you don't let him do whatever he wants to because you're the he's the president and and this is a side thing may may be a longer conversation\nBut Monica Lewinsky is not a meat to victim she is not ready as it is she was a willing participant in an old fashioned affair is what she was\nAnd he could have said no could have said no she absolutely should have said no he obviously should have said no and and from his perspective you know he's the price of the United states he is doing things that he should not be be doing\nBut like it's totally different than Juanita Broderick or Paula Jones\nThat these are totally different stories she was a ... she was in love with the guy she told a literary trip she was in love with him like she thought that they are eventually we're going to be together and be married [laughter] but this was not a situation in which she was like oh wow I'm I'm I'm scared for my career for example like that's the thing though that was a power imbalance well\nThere's an implication even if the person doesn't do it there's an implication that maybe they'll ruin your career if you don't hook up with them or which first of all is prosecuting crime before it occurs like you get your just assuming the person's going to commit a crime and ruin your career over sexual stuff but that's a whole different story that's not what happened here\nShe was she was a willing participant in an affair she was she was into it and she was also by the way in one point is that is valid from Hillary there she was an adult\nWe we should not be excusing all actions by twenty three year old women right or twenty three year old men you were an absolute you were responding for your own actions at that time no question yeah Tripoli Seventy\nSeven B.

I mean that's amazing meet your rationale of\nOkay you but you let this guy on who did much less than they are and you shouldn't you shouldn't have let this comedian perform on your stage fright and the fact that nobody cares about these other people the same people right by the way\nWho want him to shut out Louis CK didn't care about Clinton didn't care about any of these other circumstances but he's supposed to yeah and it you know I I Will say he he was really smart about this I mean he made some\nGreat points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was just constantly trying to say well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed and try out it personally on him as to why he made the decision which is an interesting part of the story but I mean he made the point is well\nOf look what it's aligned\nWe don't allow him Lucy K. to work so what does that mean does he go on the governmental\nDoes or cutting working other jobs any work what if Louis the cake hired by Walmart would that be okay\nI I think it's it's a fascinating I ever support himself in life yeah again and the idea that this guy has not been punished for English sanity yeah\nThe Manhattan was making ten million dollars a year and he's probably now making the making of the comedy cellar appearance fifty dollars maybe five hundred dollars I don't know nothing may I wouldn't be surprised if he just walked in and does it because he wants to do it\nOr he has you know paid for this and in a large way um and you know it it certainly affected his career in a big waste last movies he's lost jobs but I mean we saw this with Charlottesville there was a guy who can again we're\nTalking about a consensual act the ... yeah yeah a contentious time he actually did it yeah it was it was intentional\nAnd ... there was one case in which as we discussed the will to them no\nAnother case on the phone where we don't know what happened another case where he started doing it and the woman left because she didn't want any part of it will be good for her or him that's what she should she should walk out and keep the loser and tell every all of her friends that he's a loser for a um but that does that mean that he should be losing jobs ten or Fifteen Years later\nCharlottesville is another great example of this\nBook we use other people we played the video and the and the audio of a you know Jews will not replace us and and all these crazy chance from the real dirt bags\nOr in in Charlottesville carrying torches and ... you know the the deepest darkest corners of the ... right and ... one of the guys who attended a rally and was in some of those videos\nOr was identified as a man who worked at a hot dog stand in California\nHe was fired from his job at the hot dog stand now how is this a good outcome for anyone that look if he is saying to black customers I won't serve you because you're black obviously we get that\nBut if there's no indication that I'm In the kitchen if that ever happened he did his job at the seemingly right for every one he was serving hotdogs and making hotdogs and it was not like you know he was not at the high levels of finance here [laughter]\nAnd so now we we we can all feel good about ourselves the dynamic of a hotdog vendor though is church that are still intimidated or other people that's true so so I get that we can all feel good about ourselves but the fact that we are instead of him having a job at a hot dog stand instead we will support him with our tax dollars\nBecause he's going to be at home and all these projects and programs that liberals have created over the years to support people in need are going to go to this white supremacist who can no longer hold down his job at a hotdog stands create a good word to morally above him\nBut I ... I don't want to ever hang out with a guy who would go to that rally and carry a torch and say Jews will not replace us never but I mean do you do what we do is we just find every one of these guy you wanted you to replace you [laughter]\nOf course they never consider you want to I Would rather not by anyone [laughter]\nI never have considered that include uh gee I guess I guess I don't why they gave me\nOr anyone else yeah it does include that uh but I guess [laughter] I really don't want anyone um it's just a it's a weird thing we're dealing with because\nYou know finding someone a in a video and identifying them on line gives you the sort of a rush of I've out of this terrible person and I can punish him who really punishing\nI mean I argued for certainly you're punishing the taxpayers of this area who now have to support the loser\nWho actually somehow was able to hold down a job selling hot dogs and now has to sit inside probably playing X. box well you're paying him to do it and you know water when but don't celebrate that one I I I don't know it's a strange direction for us to be going and there's an ad\n... yes yes it's not it's absolutely crazy\nOr so maybe the answer is um they just can't be alive anymore I mean is it almost comes down to that because if they can't support themselves\nAnd certainly the state you don't want them supported by your tax dollars right so I guess all people who are accused just starve to death now yeah I I guess that's what it comes I guess that's\nThe way it works and I I Would be nice for us to find some consistency in this world would you know the fact that like you know if you were to say the me too movement I bet to most people\nAre you sure you get hurt you get Harvey Weinstein mentioned [noise] um and you might get more maybe Kevin Spacey or one of the other two you know few few big stars but what you would almost definitely get is Donald Trump and Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh and every conservative are anyone even ...\nAnd Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh and every conservative are anyone even supposedly leaning right that you can think of that was accused those have all had huge play in the media\nThe I mean what's the percentage Ninety five percent have been on the left ... it's all Hollywood and news media people and I mean it's been almost everyone has been in those industries and those industries obviously an incredibly to the left\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like the people who are on the right pay the price for it or people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and\nYou know I think you have to get to a point where someone like Lucy K who was I think are accused ... correctly of being a dirt bag right to his ... to his own admission\nBut not not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assault at least it's not as reported\nYou know you have to look at these things at the state I mean these are is now doing shows again\nUm and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back a uh Glen or what the heck is his name you know get wrong thrush right used of uh of harassing you're young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird why I mean Mike Tyson it's pretty clear the man was convicted of rape not not ... time convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling\nOf the media he comes on and you get the silly appearances everywhere have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean and look he served time and he's out right now\nUm and so you could make the case as the left has made forever that people who go in felons should be able to come back and vote you should be we their programs to give felons and convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused just gives you that really doesn't make any sense\n... seven twenty seven back is the phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who uh is traverse thing currently or the Mediterranean Sea\nIn a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is the week so [laughter] but he's doing it alone alone which is amazing\nWhich is amazing I I don't know if there's a Web I heard that there would be some uh there'd be a boat going next to him with a webcam so you could see all the action but uh no I think he had passed a webcam to the canoe and\nAnd it's just it's just just him canoeing across the Mediterranean Sea wow it must be a water but it must be like a go pro because it would have to be waterproof but yes it's a long long journey we think he's back Monday but
