so you're just about to give me more good news\nWell the other good news is again you you you do not share your emails with Google a lot of major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do ... but bad news\nIs that a Glenn Beck dot com uses Google Google Analytics and so what that means that everyone who has ever visited your website is tracked every single thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best now do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in the\nYeah well sure but you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and their products are so good so but you don't realize that these aren't real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform\nUh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is a film that you mentioned the creepy lie has\nA when ... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peters fights or on your show recently though is uh uh he's the one who would who really got that film running\nA ... it sure wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tense for for rental or sale and it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just go to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you're not\nWell when I when my research\nA first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter] I have these amazing screen shots that like\nThey're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have three and shot showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay um let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last seven ten\nTen of these that your followers can altogether okay out an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when a K here we go this is called\nPath as the er the search suggestion effect and when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestion that you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWill buy one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay we're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what\nWe're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the creepy line [noise]\nAh it's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're absolutely right they have literally unprecedented power or two is shifts to people yes shift unstable people's shifts anybody\nUh and and they know they have this power uh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their\nEight minute film called the selfish ledger you want to get creamed out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape human kind\nOf seen it it's terrifying\nSo [noise]\nBefore we because we are going to run out of time what do we do\n\n[noise] ah well there's there's things that we can do at the individual level especially for parents I which I Am an\nA and there are things that has to be done at at a at a much higher level of you know governmental organizational so the individual level you know we can take some steps\nAre to protect our privacy and privacy of our kids so I have an article very easy to find on line that's called seven simple steps toward online privacy um you know I can give your your your staff a link to it\nYeah we'll send it out in our new letter ... not ... uh seven ... [laughter] that's okay we'll send that out today if you sign up for our newsletter if you don't have it not tracked by Google um but ah we'll ... we'll send that out today and also make it available Glenn Beck dot com um\nYeah so there are some things you can do in the ... one of the many things it's not on that list as you shouldn't be using Google Analytics which Glenn Beck dot com is using\n[laughter] so that the\nIndividual level now as the as the organizational governmental level there's other things uh you know\nSo it's not ... you shouldn't even be using a Google Chrome browser I'm ... but even if you go to is it Microsoft browser that it's powered by Google\nOr information I mean there's you know about ...\nNo matter what no matter yes I Do know which I have no matter where you go Google is there a Google Now pays apple computers nine billion dollars a year to be the default search engine when people are using safari\nWhich is which is apple your browser Google is paying apple nine billion dollars next year they're supposed to pay them twelve billion to be the default search engine\nOn safari this is for any any apple device at all so Google is everywhere where do you think Syria guesses answers from\nIt gets his answers from both Syria is is you know\nApple's personal assistant so I mean I could go on and on and on but\nTax they asked the institutional level there are things that he has to be done uh one\nOf them which I'm helping to work on with people now and we need money so you know if you guys have money out there you know step up a but we we are building monitoring system as it's you know basically filled with people's permission to look over people's shoulders and see what\nThese companies are actually showing ... and how they're manipulating people\nI Would love it but I'd love to be a part of that um how can people donate to that\nWell they can go to my Google research dot com my Google research dot com that's a very simple way to donate\nThat supports the research shows that I Do but also a that's helping to provide funds to build monitoring systems which which must exist they don't exist I did build one and two thousand sixteen but we need\nLarge scale permanent monitoring systems to keep all these these creepy arrogant people under control\nSo I Am very I'm concerned\nI'm about a GI and a a sigh I'm and I'm I'm\nConcerned that in two ways I feel as though we need some sort of a Manhattan Project to make sure America is the one that gets at first but on the other hand I don't know who I trust to have\nIt I mean you cannot put the genie back in the bottle but when when we had a GI we are in real trouble are we not\n[noise] ah ... you have no idea [laughter] if you if if no seriously if you if you knew the stuff that I knew when you were looking every day at the numbers I look at you wouldn't even get out of bed\nOkay All right well I'm going to go back to bed though\nI've I mean I've I've I've read a lot about it so what do you suggest\nWhat do you what what what should we be what should we be out in I mean I mean Congress has just useless our government is just they're not paying attention to this at all and it's moving so rapidly by the time they would enact something it will be too late\n[noise] that is correct so regulation law is not going to help us too much because I just moved too slowly and and ... it was extremely fast so ah you know that doesn't mean we shouldn't you know contact our our our our our\n... a congressional representatives correct should should try to keep the pressure on uh I've I've been a speaker uh at at meetings of the attorneys general the state attorneys general in there and those guys those guys and those women can move they can move fast\nThey do things so [noise] you know a lot beyond\nThat you know you you've got to start at the individual level I mean if you're using Gmail right now that's insane if you're using chrome that's insane if you're using an Android phone that's that's all Google\nThe ear nuts you're crazy to use products because those are all just surveillance platforms that's all they are that they're they're they're just ... feet up surveillance platforms they're just they're just excuses Google has come up with\nA for us to just tell them everything about ourselves do you how much information Google has about you\nKnow\nThey have 'em just based on your age which is I Know roughly a they have the equivalent of about three million word pages of information about you oh\n[noise]\nSo I I mean\nI guess I mean I guess I made a point to where you don't get up out of bed like you I mean I ... ... so it's overwhelming so what does that mean what I mean how do we there's no way to get it back are you familiar with solid let me go here you familiar with solid and interrupt\nYou're with solid let me go here you're familiar with solid and interrupt\nYes\nIs there any chance that that is going to play a role in the future is that a pathway\nA ... ...\nI it's hard to tell I'm a I'm going to have to say probably not because it's it's very very hard uh you know Google and Facebook in particular\nAre are so powerful and so imbedded that you just ... ... you can't really cut into them people people don't want to leave them people or you know they they love them\nAnd so it's hard you know I Know lots of people working on alternative kinds of you know and services and\nA and a lot of people are talking about block chain and so on but I mean the reality is you know we're talking about Ninety percent of search around the world is done on Google\nUh these two companies are serving right now more than two point five billion people that all the past four billion within the next three years they're just growing and growing and\nGrowing by leaps and bounds so it's concerning what they're doing in China I mean I mean I don't know how I don't know how they sleep at night\nWell that's outrageous that is ... so they because they're actually\nThey're actually partnering with the Chinese government to participate in the Chinese government's ah aggressive a program to control all of its citizens and Google is ... ... and that I mean literally making it easier and better\nMaking that kind of the easier and better that's ... that's that's outrageous\nDodger I Would I Would love to uh fly you in and spend a couple of hours with you and and have you on regularly to to be able to monitor and help in any way that we can to get the word out this is this is the thing that I think America and the world\nShould be concentrating on and no one's talking about it the world is being redesigned by a handful and we're just not aware of it and it's going to change overnight a doctor thank you so much

[noise]\nJust one week ago the Senate confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh was far from a sure thing right we didn't know\nDespite a very well coordinated and well funded opposition from the left Kavanaugh was confirmed just Saturday afternoon then quietly sworn in as a Supreme Court associate justice\nMeanwhile hundreds of protesters outside treated this normal constitutional event as if an earth killing astronauts as an asteroid was early our way\nThe irony of all of the rabbit resistance to Capitol is that the freedoms that these protesters are now\nUsing or theoretically in safer hands if he turns out to be a constitution list the media can barely mentioned this new conservative majority on the Supreme Court without\nJust throwing up a little bit in their mouth but no one explains\nWhat this conservative court actually means what does it mean well hopefully it's not going to mean it's not going to mean\nPolitical and hopefully conservative court means one that looks at the constitution and reads it as it was written\nIn other words read the bill of rights not the south African constitution as Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she does a good thing for Americans who like freedom\nBut the other irony about these protesters and their ... is that apparently they've never heard of John Roberts in other words we don't really\nKnow how Kevin always going to rule on any given case he could be you know end up being the last second favorite justice because our BJ will always be number one but since originalist\nIs a bad word for the left meaning somebody who looks at the constitution as those who originally drafted it\nThey're already working on ways to get around this conservative my job a majority there so freaked out about\nJust last week the press was saying that Donald Trump by putting Kavanaugh on was actually packing the court now have you know anything about history you know that that's not packing the court\nNowhere in the constitution does it say how many justices there should be but traditionally we have nine\nThere was only one person that ever tried to change that and that was FDR and the people didn't go for it or Brian Fallon the executive director of demand justice and the top spokesman for Hillary Clinton's twenty sixteen campaign\nTold the New York times this confirmation vote will not necessarily be the last word on Brett Kavanaugh serving a lifetime appointment on the Supreme\nCourt and quote so what does the left have in mind well for starters winning the mid term election the house in the Senate next month and then the White House in twenty twenty they if they win the house they will start the impeachment per se\nCapitalism should be shut down and freedom of speech needs to be curtailed\nI Am against that\nOne

say almost we had violated every single one and we\nDo so almost on a daily basis to all of them now we are\nThey going to re adopt those and say no you know what the reason why we're having so many
