a late last three weeks and now you get up this morning and we're hearing Willa remnants there of going to head this way or and or you know there there isn't an office or that hasn't\nBeen affected somehow or even the city secretary's office you come in they have plastic drape from the ceiling going into a funnel into a large trashed pocket\nOkay so did you have the candidates for city manager tourist city hall while they were here yes we did how did that go\nThey said what are you building a new city hall [laughter]\nWell as a matter of fact in an irregular meeting this week you are going to look at a thirty three million dollar contract that we are\nWe are and uh you know that's that's important um you know everybody has heard about steel costs and everything else all kinds of building materials going up with terrorists and so forth\nSo it's important for us to get moving as quickly as we can uh we have an architectural committee that has already met with the initial architects because we did give out that contract a while ago\nAnd the idea is to have a traditional style building similar and we're doing the same with a new police headquarters and even the library a library was bit of a challenge because of that arched roof that it has um but uh still we were able to\nWork with the architects and make sure that it's going to be kind of in line with that\nThe idea is are are you this will buildings will no longer have a date stamp on that when you look at them\nUm I Know folks come by city hall particularly folks out of town and they go oh I didn't even know that was your city hall um and yeah sure in the sixties you know somebody would have said wow that looks cool\nWell cool doesn't last very long you know what you and I thought was cool uh our grandkids now of really\nReally outlets are assuming that that uh that is approved of what kind of a timeline are we looking at is when construction would begin and then all things at the stars aligned when was the complete\nProbably twenty twenty um and uh we're actually going to have a dedication of the site of late well let's see next month um and so that the current members of council can actually go over there and\nPut a shovel in the ground and say hey I had something to do with his uh and end up probably in within two years of will actually start moving dirt ah and by twenty twenty two we should be in it if not sooner um\nWe like it to be late twenty twenty or twenty Twenty one but um things happen so uh\nUh our goal is to get our staff in there as quickly as we can uh you know because\nIf you're sitting in an office and uh you have to move your computer every time it rains a that's a morale uh it it just it makes it tough\nTo work well so you had the three candidates go through um any takeaways from that that meeting of course you knew more about these uh these guys and other folks did but what ...\nWell I think you know of one we were very pleased with the work that a ... on the search firm did for us uh there were some questions or on a several candidates and they dug deep into the weeds or and so we were able to know\nWhat was going on a there was a you know something that came out of another media outlet and uh\nWe were already aware of how that issue came about how was dressed addressed and a rectified um\nThe other things that we knew we talked to folks from other cities in one particular case of one of our council members has a tie in with a prominent citizen in a neighboring town of which gave us\nA little bit of different insight because you think about it here we are we have Brian next to us and ah you know College Station and a guy I think it will be safe to say on some matters we have a friendly competition going on a and that was the same case in in this particular scenario that I was referring to\nSo it was helpful to know that a a candidate had that kind of experience and ah that yeah you want to work cooperatively but yet you want to make sure you're doing the best for your city as well\nHey possibility the hiring will be part of Thursday is meeting\nIt could be it could be a council is going to have to take a look at contracts we do this routinely every time you have a new employee a particularly at a high level or and there are five positions to report directly to counsel\nSo we looked at each of those contracts and make sure that we're comfortable with it sometimes law has changed a little uh or or even just the way that some of the conditions of hiring some times change a little bit\nSo we're we're going to take a close look at that uh probably an executive session and I would expect or we may be able to come out of workshop and actually take some action in public\nBecause this would be your last option to take action before the election would it not is this your last meeting\nWell we yes uh because uh let's see we don't meet until the second Thursday in November So yeah this will be the the last one in October that were actually together so\nWe're we're actually going to be you know taking good hard look at it we've extended our executive session time uh for tomorrow a little bit just so\nThat we can give adequate time to that discussion\nWould you prefer to do this and this this case it rather than a scenario where you had to have especially called meeting for this specific\nPurpose you know I think I think it's in the best interests of the citizens when we can be consistent with our meetings and meeting times and days and so forth um because this way they can come they can hear of like I said we won't take any action we never do an executive session we always\nUh like I said we won't take any action we never do an executive session we always wait until we come to workshop when where the citizens are present that's the whole purpose of it is to have that level of transparency\nCall Mooney joining the mirror of College Station I hate to make you sound like a construction superintendent but you got a lot of things going on so the other thing is I think a five hundred eighty five thousand dollar contract to having to do with the old arch council building now in converting that's so what's the timeline there\nWell there there were moving um the arts council is just about out of there um and we're going to be jumping in there or you know the Myers were kind enough to give us funds that we could apply to that so it really didn't have to come out of the general fund\nOr and or we're going to get that going so it becomes the community and senior center or that we approved and ah it'll be a great place I mean what what an outstanding location I don't think we've really fully utilize that whole festival area\nRight out there I'm On the top of the hill\nAnd uh to be able to do that a and with the seniors having active programs there I'm hoping that they'll be able to come up with some ideas and\nYou know we can draw some of the folks not just those who live here now but those who are considering about coming to College Station let's show them why we're so such a vibrant\nCommunity okay so what do you think you open the doors as a senior center you probably late summer okay I'm going to circle back to city hall for second you're talking about all the things that you've had to make do with that stuff costs money [laughter] or how how do you find what you're just stopgap you're having to do right now\nWell for example one of the things we're able to do is um we're able to use some of the return on investment dollars if we get some from enterprise funds are particularly the electric utility\nUm that is going to help us reduce some of the costs so we don't have to actually fund or go into debt for some of the some of the amounts for the city hall\nOr we're going to utilize what we can from what we already have go when we go over there I'm a you know I was uh on my office at the university isn't temporary quarters right now um and when we moved into those temporary quarters we saw that all the\nFurniture from the previous occupants was left because they got brand new furniture oh right well we're not going to be able to do that right away and part of that is to try to have as much of a cost savings as we possibly can ... so we're going to be looking at different ways to\nReduce our costs but still provide ourselves and the citizens with good services through efficient use of tax dollars\nBecause it's our job to pay attention to things that go on in the city we necessarily are aware of things more than the general public might be more and more this has happened the latest latest example this was a yellow bicycle so I mean now there are other people who are understanding and now who weren't paying attention I notice on workshop what do you expect to hear about [noise]\nYeah I I expect well one city has revoked the permit for ... to do business in town um some of the promises that were originally ... made to the university into the city or simply haven't been kept 'em\nYou know we the city has a escrow account um and that escrow account has been tapped into\nUm awful has not been able to provide the pickup services that they promised a\nUh in speaking just the other day with our interim city manager we know that uh they have reduced staff uh and uh\nThey used to go around with a rented enterprise fans are and pick up these bikes that were had gone astray well that's really gone way beyond what they expected\nClorox twenty three percent and ... twenty three percent ...

of news must go through some sort of Trump's filter to see whether you can blame Trump or excuse Trump or ... no one can just talk about an issue anymore but through at the ... about halfway through the story\nYou get this and I was fascinated by this discussion\n'em how to define identity\nResearchers say gender identity comes from the brain not the body some put it more bluntly that originates between your ears not between your legs\nAnd so yes I Would say like that strikes me as I read it again almost like a conservative critique right of\nThat come in between is not your leg right exactly\nRight and this is supposed to be what the researchers are saying and it struck me as I was reading this that\nWe're discussing two different things like the reason why you would want someone to register as a male or female let's say on a government health care for right would be something because not because of the feeling in their brain right like that what they really are at like you would have to cover for example ah you know birth\nRight of something that a man can't do that again that stuff out of their ... controversy of of Obamacare and other things but the the point being\nYou know you were there was a reason to know these things in theory\nWith the government not because they're tracking how the feeling they're not tracking um how you feel in your brain right they're talking about specific things that that\nBody parts can do and you know that it ... you know there might be a higher risk of breast cancer or higher risk of another site type of cancer that doesn't change because\nYour mind feels like you're more like a boy than you are a girl gender has they have gotten away from one traditional definition of gender which is male or female\nFrom one traditional definition of gender which is male or female um ... what the other part of the definition of gender is describing traits\nThat is really kind of you know a feminine that is a traditional a masculine gender may those traits the tomboy the tongue boy that's a masculine gender trait\nOverly front but those are traits no we want to talk about trades okay but we're talking I thought about saying that you are actually a woman\nAnd that's not true\nSo Dr Deborah ... is with us she is a journalist insects researcher and a and has her head screwed on rights and isn't afraid she's Canadian I don't know what's what it is with the Canadians having more guts than us but ah she's a Canadian researcher and a has spoken out about this and\nThe sex change and everything else is not changing those suicide rates so why are we taking the the gender is more for you and say hey it's totally fine when it's not it's not the suicide rates were bad\nUh I Would agree but when we talk about his coma bitty I Do think many people who are coming out is transgender nowadays\nProbably have some other psychiatric condition that isn't being diagnosed because clinicians aren't able to do their job properly\nSo if someone comes into your clinic and says that they are transgender I don't work with patients anymore but um if someone comes in and says that they're transgender a clinician really does have to take that at face value they're not really allowed to to ask deeper question because that scene that's trans Celtic so I think nowadays because it's seen as very trendy to trends\nThat can be part of it ends up someone who has\nAnother form of psychopathology it's manifesting is something that has to do gender even ... I think that you said um\nBut with regards to why transitioning shouldn't be seen as something beneficial in research that show\nFor some people that can help I Do think if others things happened ruled out\nThat it it can be beneficial for somebody um I think ultimately adults should be free to do what they want with your body\nSo so do I don't get me wrong so do I but I I I think was a a I was getting to and you just answered is this trends phobia of is this just hurting everybody into Ashville questions is dangerous it's just dangerous for people\nAnd and when we we should look in the end you're an adult you get to do what you want to do and I'm fine with that but just the silencing of thought and in this case science and medicine is is terrifying\nYeah but I mean going back to the difference between gender disoriented if something like anorexia with people who are gender just for their brains has been partially either ... or send an I\nWrite and direction I got out of that the gender they'd done if I write the thing is\nThese studies that show that in the brain ... are also conflated with sexual orientation so if you have a study on trans women say so these are people who have borne out that identifies female they are also attracted for the most part two men\nSo when you to be spraying studies we're still not clear on it the differences we're seeing are due to then identifying female\nOr do to them being sexually attracted to that because there are a very strong neural correlate that are associated with sexual orientation that that's the other thing that people aren't talking about is that this has a lot to do with sexual orientation being gay\nAnd so the brain call it that people are talking so much about how transgender thing transgender is in the brain it's not really accurate because when we don't know for sure yet\nTorture Denver so thank you so much appreciate it\nOnly enlightening talked to somebody who was not politically correct\nAnd it

College Station Bryan claimed that\nThey must be ice skating on the lake so fire and held today [noise] because hell has frozen over a ... a member of the media has now actually admitted that he shouldn't have dismissed Juanita broad Rick's accusation against a Bill Clinton\nNow this is coming from a columnist for the Washington Post where his name is Richard Cohen he's worked at the post ... sixty eight [noise] and he just wrote an opinion piece titled I thought one either Broderick was incredible\nI was wrong\nNow Juanita Broderick is the woman who alleges that Bill Clinton raped her when he was running for Arkansas governor in Nineteen Seventy eight but since the me too movement exploded over a year ago there's been a title shift in the culture culminating in the tug of war over allegations during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat one of the biggest takeaways from those hearings according to those on the left is that you always us believe the victim\nDuring the hearings Anita Hill was once again in the spotlight brought up over and over again and her accusations against Clarence Thomas universally believed to other media\nYet somehow some of Bill Clinton's accusers still haven't been extended the same sympathy as Dr Blasey Ford and need a hill\n... that's really why is it's so unusual to hear a Bill Clinton supporter at MIT\nWhy is it so unusual to hear a Bill Clinton supporter admit that they may have been wrong about Broderick it's Twenty years later now this has been obviously influenced by the me too movement but Cohen now admits\nTo dismissing Broderick claims during the Clinton presidency is just another wild accusation made by twisted Clinton haters NBC's Lisa Myers recently told slate I tested Broderick story every way I could again and again and again I'm quoting\nAnd no detail ever changed it never got better it never got worse it was always the same and\nQuote Cohen\nNow wonders why Monica Lewinsky is now totally characterized as a victim while Broderick is ignored\nIsn't that interesting\nMonica Lewinsky who has always say she says she wasn't a victim is now the victim and Broderick who is always claimed it was not consensual I was raped she's ignored\nCohen says it might have something to do with Broderick bring being a Trump supporter come on I could never have anything to do with it going writes\nI remember refusing to deal with the Broderick allegations because I simply chose to believe Clinton was not a rapist my position has proved naive\nMe ask you a question\nUnlike Broderick who had all of the evidence had witnesses unlike heath Allison who the witness is very credible has nothing to gain everything to lose\nThe evidence is overwhelming those two things you can look at and you can say there's evidence there you'd shoot you chose to ignore it with Kavanaugh\nThere was no evidence but if suddenly there was a bunch of evidence\nAnd it was presented I Would be fine with saying wow okay new information looks like Kavanaugh did it why is it that no one on the left is willing to do that\n\nWhether dealing with Clinton or the capital cases all political camps should tread carefully in their certainty about the truth certainty always seems to get us into trouble requires a huge dose\nOf something more elusive than the truth to be able to survive today and that\nIs humility Cohen seems to be exercising humility and for that I think the Washington Post columnist\nThank you\nFor being willing to step out of the crowd go against maybe some of your peers and say you know what I think we were wrong about this one thank you Richard Cohen\nIs a pretty big moment we recently went over the details that Broderick accusation like to have her um yeah she she would come on I think she it was interesting to see that because I honestly the same thing had a similar reaction to it at the time or in which\nA lot of the accusations but affairs and stuff seem to be credible but you know rapists I mean the the\nThe accusation was really brutal ... at the time she had five corroborating witnesses that she told at the time or she talked about seeing a I think it was a prison\nOr in the outside of the window ... um which was confirmed that prison was there she was confirmed to be at the nursing cameras that was there he was in town like I mean there was a lot of it was on like the she knew that she knew what hotel was that\nAh and she knew the time period I don't know if you know the exact date but everything else you had pretty much locked down pretty ... I Will tell you I\nAlways found her credible I found her more credible than anybody else you know Paula Jones\nYou know I don't know [noise]\nBut ah\nBut Juanita Broderick I absolutely believed her from the beginning and she has been one woman who has been so wrong\nOver and over and over again\nIs completely undefined I mean you know I asked you out you said no I asked you out a second time and now I her rapist yeah Murray I mean it's it's crazy and confusing\nAnd I don't know you know as a as a twenty something Boyer\nFusing and I don't know you know as a as a twenty something boy or a Seventeen year old boy\nWell anyway\nWell it's in there who would argue its consequences ... right like they should yeah I I Am I getting real that by anybody I'm not getting in trouble with anybody I mean\nIt's really not much for it not consequences for it right yeah not at all um I mean the the pastors that are in the score some you may remember glad I don't know if you know Doug Wilson but he um he got famous because he was debating Christopher Hitchens you went around and he was the he was the apologist green apologies that went around with him and\nAnd so and so he laid that all out about how you know destructive this really is to relationships and how it's the silent killer\nBecause there's a stigma with with pornography like if you go into you know your church is your testimony and there's some sort of\nYou know like a drug addiction or something like that you know there's a lot of sympathy for you and and people you know roll out the right guy but there's you know if you come up and you're the porn guy right now it's like you don't how many how many how many times have you seen that testimony or church I have never seen it right and so and so\nAnd actually the numbers and the studies show that even church leaders are are falling victim to to this so I Know there's a reason why they're not bringing it up there there's a fear that they're going to be found out too\nI Know in you know in in in my church\nAnd you know my church is a good way to to you know [laughter] I don't drink milk [laughter] and it it it's the number one reason families are breaking up is the number one cause of of problem is pornography and it starts out as pornography and it just spirals out of control\nThey too if you're if you're ... you know you're having a porn addiction issue like you're probably not going to want to stand up and front you're right because the stigma is big\nI think it's interesting about what you've done here is like ... that the same way that the the negatives of what has happened with porn which is the stigma has been taken away 'cause you could just do it on line and your own right like this course that you have is kinda the same it takes away the stigma of having to admit it necessarily\nYou can kind of go through and and here these things without having to stand up in front of your church I don't know your neighbors\nAbout it I mean I Know you're ready I Know it's really I Know it's I understand the stigma but it's the same kind of stigma as you would have as a as an alcoholic twenty five years ago you have to um there's ... it is\nThis is natural as you said God gave us the sex drive and it is different between men and women\nAnd men are driven by their eyes it ... and we just are\nWe're very visual women or not is visual as we are when it comes to sex and so there's it's it's normal media normal yeah you would have this Dr what makes us not an animal\nIs trying to say okay some of that is good some of the too much of this is bad\nRight right and then what we're doing is like I said we're pressing the reset button and showing you where God has laid out because cultures gone so off the rails and that's part of that's been infused in the church I mean even the stuff you let inside\nYou know the stuff we allow ourselves to watch I mean 'cause you can talk about pornography and say oh hard core pornography yes that's pornography but what do you watch it on Instagram which feeds are you looking at\nI mean is in ... I'm not like the women in bikinis showing their butts right now I mean like only when I got in the rain when you're growing that all the way through\nI mean you know not be considered part I think I think some people could make that case it didn't make a strong case this is an argument that the movie you know\nMy wife and I have all the time a because there's almost nothing that you could watch on Netflix or Amazon yeah that unless it's an old TV series or something there's almost nothing that you can watch that doesn't have this\nYou know so you know is click click click and it was go ahead and and um you know fast forward through some of that crap and that's the argument is on my wife like don't stop watch and we have stop watching it honey let's just zip ahead of this part you know\nBut is that right right is that right you know it's not ... ... ... ... in the course like how does it have recommendations for filters is it about that type of thing what would\nWe mentioned those things because they're good like having Internet filters and accountability partners and things are good but what we do is we really just tried to get to the heart of it because those things are band aids they're they're\nRight the Bible says our hearts are deceitful above all out and so it's your your heart's gonna find a way if you're still desiring that your heart's gonna find a way around your filter you're going to find another device you're going to know how to\nDo this and that to get around it Jovesa we tried to rewire your heart and show you what God will give you a positive vision to shoot for you can't just say don't do it right do it right to give me some of the stats um while I'm you know two thirds of all Christian men have you'd porn monthly they admit that I\nWould assume too that's if that's the admitted to number it's titled we I think that's probably I really just to hold on higher I think\nIt was something like I don't have one in six church leaders have admitted to struggling with this that's church one years six and so you know nine percent of churches only ... only nine percent of churches actually have resources dedicated and and I and I believe because ... is is just you know me\nSort of projecting this you know I'm guessing this but because of that and the ramp and you know numbers that are here\nI think that there's probably a little bit of fear and some of these leaders because they feel hypocritical\nYou know coming out in and saying like let's fight this thing because they know they're struggling with with themselves but I'll give you one more\nUm ah kids are being exposed to porn I mean my kids went on Syria the other day and actually said something and they miss under Syria misunderstood and came back with like a sexual thing um and my son was like what's that all about oh I'm so kids are accidentally or intentionally getting exposed at pornography as young as ten and eleven years old\nAnd they're getting married later so now think about that if you start getting into port at ten eleven twelve years old and it becomes a habit for you um and then you don't get married until you're twenty eight or twenty nine years old you've been poisoning your brain now\nIn how you view women for ... you know two thirds of your life who thirds of your life and an hour and ... people to to be a good husband and it takes more and more to excite you yes I mean it just it a gateway it the gateway it is you start with porn and and we we\nLook at affairs and that's the other thing that ... where does that usually start it didn't start just one day you wake up and say I'm going to have an affair with my secretary [laughter] started in the house\nIn your phone you know and like and we can talk about this but I guarantee you our voices right now we're hitting the numbers don't lie the numbers don't lie we're hitting you were not getting your neighbor were not hitting somebody else I guarantee you there's somebody sit in their car listening to this\nAnd and it's hitting home right now because it's the silent killer and you've been walking around with that would that shame and guilt and so that's why\nWe made this course set free course dot com because you know God wants you to be free from this he he wants you to live in you know shame free guilt free from this and he's given you the tools to fight it and so that's what we want to thank you very much Dan thank you thank you for having me\nYeah I guess he's doing something with his life [laughter] after this\nSet free course dot com is the place to go get it and the Israel thing is coming up to where we have the ... documentary I was talking to Dan a little bit earlier today about some of the experiences of seeing the media as they cover the Palestinians versus the way they covered the lessons and old to go over there now over the media and yet that's what this documentary became because\nThe media was if you didn't stay with the gaggle\nYou actually ... you actually observe something above the gaggle down that they're just never aware of\nLaw and and even more shocking Glen is when the gavel so they're they get the story wrong I mean it was\nOh and and even more shocking going is when the guy goes there they get the story wrong\nI mean it was unbelievable to me you know because we went there to watch from you know actually do what the other presidents didn't do and and open the the us embassy there in in Jerusalem and so um that's what we were therefore but then what we saw was how the media can talk to the narrative that's completely false\nUm and I'll I'll tell you a quick story of you know for some some context I downloaded in a while I was there called red alert and so you can try this at home and tested in the if I'm if I'm I'm full of it\nBut it's called red alert and what it does is it you know you know those annoying alerts you get on your phone when their land flooded it's allowed well it does that whenever a missile or rocket has launched into Israel 'cause we wanted to follow okay there's rocket found out I rarely go we're going to go find where they are and so I downloaded this app and so I went off a few times over there\nOr I get home and you know all of a sudden it like two in the morning like my my phone's just going bananas and like all day for like three days in a row like on and off I'm getting these I had to leave the app because it was so annoying\nThat I was that these rockets were getting shot and Israel all the time and you know and then they might be a show that the picture like bears the contact like their rockets are flying in from Gaza all the time\nThat the media shows up and it's like look at these Israeli you know evil soldiers just gunning down innocent hapless and the protesters there on the on the Gaza border ... why do you think the Israelis are taking it very seriously when they're burning tires when they're burning tires and they're\nTrying to break through the fence they're taking it seriously because all the rest of\nThe days are getting rocket shot [laughter] damn thank you very much at All right\nFor more than three ah three years of software
