W. dot com or just don't sixteen twenty WTO O. W. Twenty years the College Station school districts education foundation reviewed it this week CEO size the board meeting\nA presentation by director Theresa ... many highlights for instance\nThe foundation has risen at one point three million dollars and more than five hundred teacher grants five hundred and fifty thousand dollars or five hundred eight students scholarships or the nine hundred high school graduates on during the educators among the most to them you know eight thirty four hundred educators and sixty five thousand dollars presented in the store educator thank you program\nMore than two thousand middle and high school students using the success twenty four seven online program\nThis is the third year of two programs one were more than one thousand had started to pre kindergarten students will receive ten thousand dollars in butch also one hundred thirty first year teachers have received gift cards\nThis is the second year of course these calls that were more than two thousand students have received clothing in a program that's involved in a hundred volunteers here are more like Trump Theresa bending the director of the city of science the education foundation beginning with their employer given campaign\nWhen we first started this program we didn't know what would happen we didn't know where we would go with this\nFirst year Twenty one percent of our employees gate Fifteen almost sixteen thousand dollars\nThis past year we just finished up our campaign ad for this school year of course we had our twentieth birthday as our thing and we were able to hit fifty percent of our employees giving and they have pledged a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars\nTo our foundation which I Will tell you personally it's a very humbling because to me that is who we serve we're here to serve our teachers and our students and if they're the ones that are ... you know they they believe in what we're doing and so they're willing to put\nPut their money in the pot as well so it really is um I get kind of emotional to be honest with you because\nIt's an emotional that many people are are willing to support us um and we've almost raised half a million dollars just to this program at that will hit that next year\nTwo years ago we really decided that we needed to do something a little different than just depend on the menu can cook as our main and razor\nAnd so and talking with other foundations across the state I knew in in your campaign was was the way to go and we decided to call it are partnering program so we put this together two years ago in two thousand Seventeen we rolled it out\nAnd really it's kind of a one stop shop because no but what was happening as I was going to our donors and saying hey well you sponsor fifty men we use sponsor hall of fame will you do this\nAnd this is what this does is it kind of roles that all into one program and give them opportunities to have\nSponsorships and recognition all of our programs all of our bands crises closet all the things kind of roll into one nice donation and they loved it [laughter]\nAnd I loved it because it was a nice easy way to to pull everything together and to even raise more money because what happened was you would start talking to people about sponsoring pitching men but they didn't understand what the money went for\nAnd with this program we really sat down with people had an opportunity to really share and show them the impact that were making with our programs and our activities\nSo this program as we're only in the second year of it and we're just\nYou know still working on are getting our donations in this year that really we're we're going to hit probably half a million dollars in the in the in these two years of with this program because it's just been that successful and it's we've been able to have more of a chance to talk to more businesses and\nSuccessful and it's we've been able to have more of a chance to talk to more businesses and I think they like that and it shows that we have ... shows that we were doing what we say we're saying we're doing and it doesn't hurt that see a chart saint Joe came in at twenty thousand for our twentieth birthday this year either so that was a nice bonus so\nI wanted to show you all kind of a little pie here where the money does come from and I'm really excited that dark partnering programs really thirty five percent of the money that we do race now comes from our partnering program which is really important because after a new campaign and that's where the money really should be the bulk of it should be coming from\nOf course we still do really well a Fifteen minute can cook thirty percent is coming from that employee giving is a huge chunk now Fifteen Percent\nAnd of course we still have money coming in for a scholarship\nWe have several people that are still in doubt scholarships and and that's always a good amount and then we have minor money coming in from our other smaller programs\nWe also do pretty well on our investments because we have a board restrict amount which I'll share it with you in a second so four percent of our money actually comes from our investment\nWhere does the money go once it comes in and this is kind of a nice little chart that shows you most of it does go out to the teacher grants scholarships or a large amounts\nWe also have a border restrictions bond that we have set aside kind of a rainy day fund if you will that we hope to help pay for some of the um overhead costs to get her overhead costs down a little bit\nThat some of the money does go back to our campus rebate one thing I didn't mention to you in our employee giving program\nIf you're a teacher at a campus whatever you donate to as the following year half of that money goes back to your campus an unrestricted funding so that that campus can use it in any way they would like to do that so it gives gives us a way to kind of get money back to those ... each campus that they can use it for their what their greatest needs are\nAnd then this is just kind of a financial that a glance\nStarting it's Nineteen Ninety nine if you look at the funds raise the first year a hundred and Seventy five thousand but as you can see I'm going off a lot of what we had last year 'cause those are my official numbers and have a full year to show you the last year we actually raised for five hundred and forty five thousand dollars which is almost half a million dollars we have a board restricted accounts [noise]\nObviously it was a zero and back to the very beginning\nBut now we have eight hundred thousand dollars and we hope to get that almost to a million dollars for the next year or two and like I said most of that money we're hoping that the interest that has created off of that account will do to help pay some overhead expenses and keep our overhead down\nWill defeat using our interest money to pay for that and it's also nice to have that for a rainy day in case something happens with\nOr donors or the economy you just never know it's good to have that in the bank\nAnd then of course our total assets you in the beginning of the first year they had a hundred and twenty six thousand now we have one point four million which that means we're in good shape\nThis is a Fox News alerts on average Denison Saudi state media\nIs

the business and he's not he's not a legislator he's not somebody who does this for a living so God Bless him he actually open up a discussion\nLet me give you and I found from the Washington Times during the break and this is from a two days ago headline news perceived threat long tangled history put to show the in crosshairs\nTies to Saudi intelligence Muslim Brotherhood and political activism may have led to journalists disappearance no again we know now that he's dead Saudi Arabians admit that he's dead how he died big limit or some fighters somebody who knows\nThere's a written by a person in guy Taylor over the Washington Times the prevailing narrative about the bazaar case of us based Saudi journalist ... is that Saudi Arabia is hard charging young crown prince ordered him kidnapped and perhaps killed in order to silence say particularly effective critic the road widely read disparaging columns about the ...\nIn order to silence they particularly effective critic\nErode widely read disparaging columns about the royal family and the crown prince his own ambitious reform agenda but Middle Eastern center season deeper supplies played into this show these disappearing stemming from his long career political activism ties to Saudi intelligence end\nMr to show these past relationship with the Islamic group the Muslim Brotherhood restricted she'll be fifty nine years old he disappeared\nAs the Saudi conflict new stumbled on October second is said to have withdrawn years ago from any formal affiliation with the Brotherhood but his past ties to the trends national Islamic group are believed to have been a source\nOf distress for Saudi group a crown prince\nMohammed bin some on the thirty three year old prince rented the Brotherhood of terrorist organization and one of his signature moves as air to the Saudi throne was to cut all ties\nWith the rival Gulf nation of Qatar the prince blames do offer financing the Muslim Brotherhood to foment unrest\nAgainst the powers that be across the Arab world in particular Saudi Arabia is leaving Saudi Arabia for self imposed exile in the U.S last year new stricter show he has worked to create an advocacy group called democracy for the Arab world now dawn to promote Arab Spring style freedom movements\nAcross the middle east All right so as they walk away from this I said to myself okay here's a news source of the Washington Times that says there was a Muslim Brotherhood connection\nHere's the news or the Washington Times it says that he was critical\nThe reforms that his crown prince wanted to put in place that those reforms are in fact pushing away from from Islamic law well how to use them and as I read this it also seems to say that he was\nHe was for democracy in the middle east so I'm Still confused now I don't need you to call in and try to an confuse me because again I'm going to go buy a viable ooh sources so what I have is people telling me rush said that this guy was grocery law was pro Islamic rule\nWould have got here is the Washington Times saying he was critical of the reforms that would seem they seem to coincide makes sense\nAnd then I've got but I also have the same story saying that this guy was promoting a democracy in the middle east\nI mean\nThat that's interesting to me\nThe last sentence or some say Muhammad who was a reputation for quickly identify new crushing any threats to his authority was well aware of Mr ... political activists uh activities and likely more concerned about them that his journalistic effort as a columnist for the Washington Post so there could be something here buddy surface that we don't know about\nThe suggestion here by this writer\nIs that this was not about journalism this was about his activism is activity about promoting an Arab Spring like a movement in in the middle east by the way to get an ... guy wrote but anybody who wants more Arab Spring is an idiot\nI don't think it's getting killed oh you should\nDie because you say that but the Arab Spring was a horrible mess it melted down the entire region\nThis was promoted by supported by Obama it was horrible\nIt was horrible it was the worst thing that could have happened in that region in fact the military had to take over Egypt I'm from the Muslim Brotherhood because of how horrible it was they were there were there were instituting I'm sure your law immediately Islamic law immediately and the military said screw that we're not going to stand by what you do that and they took back over so\nIt's an interesting story certainly does President Trump to do with it no that I could I could do was walk you cash for a while with his rights to allege that the son in law the president Jared cushion or do you have a hit list to um to this guy or the crown prince and then the crown prince acted on it now it's disgusting but he said that\nAnd he should be lost out of office there should be an ethics investigation to walking Castro he should be censored\nAnd he should not be reelected in this election coming up he's going to be 'cause San Antonio for some reason loves the Castro brothers doesn't matter what they say or do but that's horrible what he said it's disgusting actually I ate at eight nine four one packs a day to day nine four one Seventy four seven\nThere's anybody on this uh ... I'm going to go to a bill you need to get a bill I've got literally thirty seconds to make it out but let's go\nI'm just saying I'm a first thing I thought that's kind of strange when you said viable news source which I think honestly this day and age most Americans believe that's an oxymoron yeah maybe\nA secondly em I think it's very clear that there's a whole lot more on this story you or I Can't see someone\nBasically this memory and individual because they are trying to get [noise] be able to put more media against them um that so I'll leave that bad but I agree Trump I have\nNothing to do with our bill I appreciate you know I think you're right that's a hundred percent right to me\nThat there is a lot more to their story than we that we have any clue about we don't know what happened to this guy but as we get more details are bringing to you and I love you guys but if you give me some news source that you can't say I can't really go with it and it eight nine for one pack Joe ... when we come back there you're listening to show [noise]\nIn the house and Senate are only one of these in in the house and it was one guy a Watson or in the Senate\nIt was one guy Strom Thurmond and those are the only two Dixiecrats who became Republicans are all the other state and lived and died in ... in the Democratic party and have been lying eyes the Democrats their buildings in Washington DC named after them do\nObviously people like Robert Byrd\nOr who is the guy with not only in the Klan but he's still about ... the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four I Believe he's worked for fourteen hours straight or a record and sell this\nAll right back to Nineteen sixty four I Believe he's worked for fourteen hours straight or a record and so this these other democratic he\nWas just the Democratic party one claim that now\nThat Hillary Clinton's mentor by the way Robert Byrd it is a ... to\nGo and get the DVD destination if you haven't seen it in the movie theater you've got to go read the book as well to get everything else that he's done as well it's really a great education every single time and I love when people tell me it's been debunked him and I asked him well which factor exactly why aren't allowed to ask them I'm not really sure which one it was I'm Talking about Hillary Clinton the top trending thing on drugs today\nWas that she might go for a one more time and twenty twenty\n... delusion here in her or or do the Clintons still have a stronghold on the Democratic\nParty I thought that they were done well\nThey're they're not done I mean here's a proof of that um we've had the me too movement or and it's taken out a number of people\nOn the program at the last ... noticed it hasn't taken out Bill Clinton or if it had the Clintons could never have announced this speaking to work and what did you have to pay hundreds of dollars just to get to hear them\n\nAs a Bill Clinton continues to me to a certain degree lion ice in legitimate in the Democratic party how these people have managed to stay one step ahead of the odyssey for three decades I I think you've got to admire that from a distance it requires an unbelievable what's possible\n... yes but also there has to be delusion there she lost she is now I think are approval rating is about thirty thirty five percent something like that which is probably artificially high because of the media does these things I mean for her to think that she's even still ... has a chance\nAs she will do hold me too movement has exposed her it still doesn't really expose him your right for some reason he's still the golden boy but did expose her horribly for how she treated these women that came forward again with allegations against her husband\nIn this day and age where the leftist pretending they care about women in particular they care about sexual assault how could she ever be prominent again\nHer not ... he gets away with it\nIt's really obvious that the last ...\nDoesn't care about these things and here's the smoking gun proof of that or just a couple of weeks ago really we heard from Christine for about ... and the idea of what these women need to be heard we need to have justice for victims of sexual assault\nAll the highest rhetoric now noticed at the moment the Kavanaugh if confirmed\nChristine Ford became a non entity articles about her suddenly the whole thing has disappeared suddenly the media and wanting to get justice for the victims of forgotten about all the victims and I'm\nPretty sure that in probably a few months we'll have difficulty recalling my main do and so all of the shows the degree to which these are people who are being used as instruments of\nConvenience the moment they stopped being a human grenade they end up positive safely in the trash\nThat so it's a very good way to put a you're exactly right I mean the fact that find started selling these allegations of this letter for two months in men exposed a leak turn me which you didn't want it out there shows you exactly how much they don't care about these these victims were these alleged victims that are coming forward\nBut as soon as a destination go and get the DVD it's out now do they go to the death of a nation dot dot com or ... movie dot com\nDetonation movie dot com or you can just order and directly from my tunes any of the places that you get and then eventually later this month you'll be able to get it in red boxing Walmart and everywhere when the physical DVDs out that's still a week or so away as do the digital downloading and streaming now\nThe media didn't ashes ignoring mostly what's happening to Portland in Portland, Oregon ... which are\nMisnamed it's a misnomer they are the fascists in our society are closing down roads telling people what they can they can do they're pulling people out of cars that are threatening people's lives they're damaging their vehicles and the police are actively standing down and they're being told to stand down by the mayor and those who are running the city\nIs this just exactly what we saw eighty years ago or Ninety years ago in in Germany and Italy is this how it starts you shut down the road to let anarchy takeover\n\nYes the the key to the a fascist and Italy and he's ... he's a black I'm a black shirt and then also Hitler's brown insurance is that ultimately they were protected by the state uh and\nEventually they of course when the Nazis took power they merged with the state they became part of the state apparatus\nUh sometimes people will equate I Will say you know and if it's not a problem let's remember that there are these white nationalists\nAnd they are the real danger I'd antifa nearly trying to stop them um and the problem here is that while the white nationalist sub politically and culturally and significant I mean if the if the Ku Klux Klan and where to have a rally tomorrow they'd be lucky to get to a hundred people and memory five times as many protesters yeah\nThe problem with aids and he's like I said that they are protected they have the Democratic party behind\nThat they've got the meat\nEating behind them they have powerful elements in Hollywood and then you know they're powerful elements in government the mayor of Berkley Jesse arrogant as a member of sound antifa Facebook\nWell ... the mayor of Courtland will call the top down so this\nIs a domestic terrorist group you might say that actually has friends in high places\nWhere it really does I mean and Chris Cuomo is it like my idol when it comes to media but he's here's a guy who's got a show on a major media network who has said yes it is okay to let them do that\nAs long as it's going against the people that you just talked about the the the alleged so you know All right or white supremacist or whatever I mean they are they really are saying it's not equal when it comes to the law if the lawbreakers are doing something that we agree with\nAnd remember what the fascist and they basically said listen the Jews control the economy that Jews have in in in simulated then in city insidious Lee into all elements of government so we have to fight the Jews with with\nWith the kind of weapons that they use against us ultimately when Hitler was talking about the big lie he wasn't saying hey I'm not a big lie he\nWas using the Jews are perpetrating a big lie right eye so ironically Hitler was the one he was lying he was the one in wanting to take over the economy he was the one in line to salvage to rounding up control but he was rejecting those accusations onto the Jews and then using that as a pretext for his own lawlessness\nAnd are busy or and I appreciate your one last quick question from ... or get death of a nation on DVD is out now I'm ... years here's the thing that I say and and you either right or wrong and you have no problem telling me what I'm wrong\nHitler was charismatic I thought the guy was kind of ugly so I really can't compare him to a really good looking person that's running today that's getting a bunch of press but he was charismatic and able to grab your attention with the way that he spoke\nWe're seeing that with a ... now in Texas because the court has now in New York you're seeing it now in Florida with Gillum you've got left wing socialist who are admitting that they would like to impeach the president or or abolish ice or open the border or shut down the police I mean this guy or worked in Texas has called police the modern day Jim Crow\nBut these people are generally speaking good looking charismatic good speakers looked nice on camera is that what we're seeing happen again like we saw with\nA Hitler back in the day Hitler came to prominence because people want to hear him speak\nPower of Hitler in ... was that they were able in a very shrewd way to tap\nInto a deep vein of frustration and discontent ... much of that in Germany came out of World War one the feeling that Germany had been screwed over by the treaty of Versailles and Hitler was able to sort of massage that discontent\nAnd ... or a sigh and Hitler was able to sort of massage that discontent and they're very emotionally effective and galvanizing way now obviously the situation is different the world is different history doesn't repeat\nItself identically by I think it's fair to say that this deep vein them democratic just content over losing the election and they thought they were so close or the sense that they that that sort of thing guys have been tried loose from the lever some control you know and they're all like\nMad about it and what these guys like Ocasio Cortez doing battle and so on and they're trying it happened to that vein of discontent because they know that that's political capital there\nAnd girls are lying if they actually stay with the ... because the court judge was saying what she believes a O'Rourke is not a Walker's law using what spring Texas together and work across the aisle and I love every body and all for one and one for all but then you look how he votes and he wants to raise taxes regulations that he wants to basically open the border because he feels bad about Mexico somehow\nSo I mean it it it really is a couple of different patches on how they're doing it but it is grab the most charismatic person you can cause you're going to get some votes just because people are are ignorant basically and they'll vote for who they feel like they're like\nYeah the Democratic party has always been sort of been divided into the the wing of the income groups and the ...\nOf the sort of ... just as the Jimmy Carter for example to me if you were happening out and then ... what he'd have to give it to him he was well meaning goals are good but he was just incompetent\nAnd the heat and now violence than print guy\nObama like in the latest yeah he was somebody who and independent wanted to reduce America's wealth and power where it's all just by his standards he wasn't affected\nIt's been ... deaths of the nation and go to definition of a nation movie dot com or get it on our tunes or it will be all over the place very very soon didn't ...
