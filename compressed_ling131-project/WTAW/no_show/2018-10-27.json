day coverage a week ago a rare Saturday afternoon game against Katie ... forty eight nothing to find ... however you slice it a shutout is shut out no matter what team I thought that was quite an accomplishment\nBut I was real proud of our deep and a lot of people ask me how you think the deepest place horse over mistakes made but when you shut a team out you're proud of what your defense did you know and that type deal and you know to put up forty eight points ...\nYou're proud of what your defense did you know and that type deal and you know to put up forty eight points ... scored more I feel like we could if we executed things we did but we came away with the wind and that's all that matters\nA we had mentioned in the early part of the broadcast offensively we had not been calling ... name out as much as we thought we would but I did feel like that we found ourselves calling him out a lot if you had to look at somebody that was leading the defense that the afternoon I thought he had a pretty darn good games\nYeah I think he did a great job you know we were I'm playing him and some different roles from the inside lumbar outside line burn a code Redmond said he did a great job watching you know make as a calls out because a lot of times he was having a lead our our deepest calling applies when he went to that Mike linebacker and he did a good job but he made a lot of\nPlays for ... you know when you have a running back by the name of major pain as one of the great all times it's almost like a rock Cartwright from Cohn wrote back in the day let's let's talk a little bit about why in the world anybody runs toward Josh jealous I mean it didn't take them long ago when you run in any direction ... left or right\nJosh his execution in recovery seems as if he is that player we used to see on the other teams that were the one recruits he's playing like one right now is he not helping his game week to week was that young man you know it was a leading\nRussia or in the district right now and um but I think Josh is doing unbelievable you know he's lost some weight but it's all muscle that's on Iran now what what impresses me about Josh right now it's not about what he does just in the interior he'll run sideline a sideline chase guys down and\nHe has one thing was great coach prize for main him was there because he was ever watch his son play 'cause I had to open weak\nAnd um you know ... was talking to me and said man he's unbelievable look in his speed and\nHe's definitely doing what he's got to do and you know the thing about Josh way and your your pricey for the press box will blame at the defense tackle moving in the defense in and he just shows that ... fly around and every coach I talked to that they're getting ready to prepare for us or like how do we block that young man I said I don't know you know I'm Glad that we got him on our team and he's doing a great job\nLet's talk a little bit about the special teams that had been a concern is still there are some areas that we can improve their but all of a sudden boom you send back to speed stirs to return on times it's not the ... had a great punting day but I thought that you guys did a great job and finally getting some return yards and we just haven't seen much of that the season\nYeah those were very pleased with our guys we put in extra blocking assignments the way we're going to return on our ... and ah you know both guys a great job of course we had to block in the back on one of them and that type deal but I thought they did a great job not only on the palm returned but I thought our kicked off coverage was outstanding yeah of course\nSay something I've enjoyed him his district had happened it gets Huntsville which southern and it happened last week at the Montgomery also you got another sophomore quarterback\nThat is leading the ... the district in passing anti sex then talk about what is making ... setting him apart right now Ken a sophomore really be that type of leader mature beyond his years in pulling through this brand new team\nWell I think it doesn't matter what grade you're in you know he's a he's a good quarterback now the one thing I'll say like I just said if you can get pressure on him it takes a little bit away from me man I think that's one thing will be able to do with our defensive front the way we've been playing has tried to get a lot of pressure on him and I'm with our secondary with the guys way they've been playing\nWhen I told them you know they throw the ball a lot on Saturday in our film after our game they were excited fired up because I like that 'cause now they got an opportunity possibly get some interceptions so we'll see how it goes in and prepare but you know he is a good football player he's got a good mine on his head and he doesn't let it just because he's a sophomore make any difference in white place\nYou may not be able to say it but I Will I think based on the opponents they've had before this is absolutely going to be the best secondary that lake creek has faced in my opinion you're secondary as a unit I think has really improved on a weekly basis\nThey are saying they're doing a great job and you know great thing about and they're all young they're coming back again next year but they're communicating they're doing a good job the one thing that we work on weekly is making sure what they get the calls from our secondary coaches making sure they communicate because\nYou know at the teams line up and this formation we may have this call but then they shift to something we've got to adjust and that's where you got to communicate in a secondary where all of a sudden we're on the bus to coverage\nLeon in wrapping up let's talk a little bit about what lake rate does on the defensive side of the coin I mean we mentioned there are offensive attack kind of know what their emotions going to be what kind of formation do they run and how do you match up against that\nWe've seen on film they run a lot of odd front do get into three two and they'll play a lotta man soft man so they're playing a lotta man we're going to throw the ball around a lot and then\nThey'll switch on and get what we call three three stacked do play some cover three man free that type deal but like we tell our guys we've repaired all week long to be able to look at all different fronts\nGreat thing is when you're this far in the season you've seen every front that you need to you just got to make your judgment and blocking assignments and that type deal so it may be a game where it's two teams throwing the ball around a lot then again if they're given us Ron game we're going to run the ball a lot so we'll see how it goes once we get in the gang\nLeader from a spectator standpoint wrapping up uh it it it may be more of a concern to us than it is to you but it seems like consolidated at this point in the seasons getting a whole lot of penalties seems like that penalty yard is just on the verge of a little too high is that concerning to you right now\nI'll tell you you know people ask me about that until I go back and watch film I don't say anything about ... ... but I Will say there were some penalties called that probably were a little bit missed and that type\nI Will say there were some penalties called that probably were a little bit missed in that type deal I'm you know\nThe one where we had to touch down Rene call to a holding it was a pancake he wasn't much of a hold of him as a pancake block and now but we tell our guys don't let that affect you the penalties that I get upset with his legal procedures you know jumping all sides things like that\nThe face masks we had on the kickoff coverage it was a face mask but it was just going in trying to wrap up in ... was a you know the the face masks so those are things we gotta get picked because like I tell guys you go in the game and you have one big penalty that could change again\nI Will say this to pass interference I called them we scored a touchdown it was both guys going up for the ball and I don't know if it should have been a passion and parents but is it in college where you get instant replay and get to see it all but like we do you play the game you don't worry about the tells you just keep line\nFrankly with a stadium like that they should have instant replay it's a darn shame\nAnd anyway you slice the tigers up at six in one of the season three in one district play another big one coming up late creek Montgomery the lions will be rolling

Darby nothing fancy just a little pitch from Kate in to a Darby Darby does the rest carrying it a forty one yards for a big first down in the late creek territory\nI don't know if that's the power sweet but it's a pure asleep you just ran into the ride\nDarby is all the right side of the runs this ... this time he's doing a left\n\nInstead for oil will drop straight back he's got a man cutting down the middle can't do that throws your leg and its ticked off at the goal line\nInterception by like ... they have it back and they'll take it out across the tend to the eleven yard line badly pick that off from the secretary position was child Scott's a safety and the sophomore takes it back to the eleven yard line that's one were kittens throw was just desperately off on the mark\nI'm not even sure who he was aiming at I didn't see anybody behind Scott in the end zone\nWhen she was just trying to find an open spot and didn't see it but yeah\nBut on the turnover\nIt'll be light creek checking out with a ball lions habitable headed straight ahead\nAnd again just a good solid push they run it right guard and Levi Ryan who is taking over the running backs bought this evening we think it's because of an injury to Alex Cardenas Cardenas spin they're back all season long and he's pretty good one\nGame a yard\nSo he didn't get anything all that extra push that was just a lot of time and shoving each other apparently\nIn the backfield drops straight back quick delivery across the middle of receiver and you'll have it across the twenty seven yard line out of the twenty eight and quick slant goes to Bryce Lindstrom\nAnd lets them halls it in pretty good coverage that was a well delivered ball you pointed out ... this is the guy that they can uh can throw the ball I mean he's one of the he's the districts\nAbout ... this is the guy that they can just throw the ball I mean he's one of the he's the district leader in passing right now that's a pretty passed to you got to blacks in the backfield with him now\nYou know had a little cross buck action and trying to cut it up and getting really nothing on that plane was Levi Ryan Ryan\nKnocked down and write about thirty

let's just keep it right here mark a\n... you know they don't want to give up any points but did you when when you got to de France has played as well as they have right now you take a great deal of pride in getting that shut out in and a solid to that last night with Brian getting their first shot out of the season the the consult tigers though you\nYou want it those are the kind of things you build on you're talking about building things for the playoffs shut outs the Calvin you do\nWell you're exactly right into consult tigers I think it was a third game of the season maybe before the consult tigers had given up a defensive\nTouchdown they were all ... teams have given some up and\nIn some that you would blame on the ... for bad or ... or an interception here they're deep or whatever but a a true a given up a defensive top touchdown a I think it was a third game of the season in coach the door talked about that and the fence was really fired up and and\nThey were hit big in one of the early games and they didn't want to put in the second team 'cause they didn't want to give up a defensive touchdown and\nIt's all a habit I mean yeah you're developing like getting muscle memory you want to have that when you get in the playoffs or it\nGot to believe they'll throw it here there's eight seconds left sex sex and the at quarterback\nAnd movement sections at a law this one drug allows sideline and that was made down at the seven yard line\nAnd the clock is down to three seconds so they will have a first down the catcher's made by peers Marcos it was sort of a law but back shoulder throw after stop the clock here in a forty nine to nothing game and that that will be a\nThere was a penalty job but they're going to decline at the penalty\nWhich I'm surprised they let go because it was a defensive encroachment\nIt just shows so it was almost in the backfield vaccine knock the quarter back down as he released the football and I'm surprised that they didn't\nLike they're going to try to go here blow the whistle\nTo stop the play before the path\nOf unusual down by the forty nine points they're gonna feel go\nBut I Do remember you go in with the little momentum if you can still go and you get the ball first in the second half so maybe that's the\nA twenty seven yard attempt by my God that we're going to move it up and he'll be tried it from twenty five yards\nAnd a whistle again prior to the play\n...\nBalls on the left cash bark and a guy will try to break that shut out with a a field goal here\nGood snap pictures up it's got the distance on it and the kick is good so at half time our stores now forty nine to three I consulted with that twenty yard a field goal the first points that they give it up in this opening half a guy kicks Thurgood looked in the good looking snapped Dick and uh\nAnd yet at forty nine to three you're you're you are looking for something positive at that\nPoint I think yeah no question in a lot we mentioned I think they just wanted to get something on the school board go in without the goose ... up there and they come back and they get the ball and the second half\nHighmark your thoughts real quickly about how this first half has gone it's better to press the performance by the tiger said he won't you knew they came in wanting to get this thing in in a hand relatively quickly but they've uh they've taken every advantage that they had\nAn inch shown just why it's an advantage the speed they have the damn feel blocking by their receivers I'd like to receive has been worrying\nAnd said yeah I ... my take is a consult soccer's did their do their homework looked at the field they're really taking advantage of the weaknesses on\nOn the lake ... defense in really since you're waiting uh their weakness on office and they knew that that a six to what's going to come in and try to throw the football but they haven't seen the secondary lots of consult tigers have with the speed and the ability to cover in a ... to\nConsult defenders are just getting are on the receivers you get behind the defenders and getting open with the speed\nAnd our defenders are able to keep up with with

into it I don't I mean does it um you know it just felt uncomfortable\n... do you do this because you're ashamed of your brother\nOr your ... your your grand uncle\nWell I'm a little bit I don't want to be known that just that you know I could have had some I've had some ... some challenges I guess you'd say could person\nAnd I've had some part some challenges I guess say could person no ... and I've had bad thoughts about but like what was his doing bad things and I talked to people and they said you know like\nThey said it's not uncommon to have that and I had something called ... affective disorder\nSchizophrenia form disorder is called skits so effective because the fact of disorder\nAnd it's mostly depression but it's kind of\nA a if I don't take my medication for a long time and I figured that if I see if everybody's smiling at me that if people are smiling than I I feel bad and then I ... a I have a friend you know she'll catch me\nAnd and and then and then realized that I haven't been taking I have to accept the call getting the uh\nIn lithium things like this you know I've taken so it's\nHave you been have you ever been told your danger to others when you get this way oh no\nI'm I'm very kind not danger to anybody you know a very kind nature you live alone but well I live alone but my next door neighbor is a good friend we were really good friends\nYou have a dog or cat\n[laughter] yeah okay I have a dog but I'm I'm a nice person I just ... it's not I don't I'm a little ashamed of that this is how I make my living you know can I just I was just happen to be bought at a when he died you know\nHad a place in um [noise] I don't know if you know we're the pine barrens are in New Jersey\nNo I've only been to a grower his mental actually I've been to grow rice milk\nOkay but there's a place called the ... which are very kind of creepy\nBut there's a place than in Tom's river and and it was near there that he had a place and then in his garage yet you had a lot of projects that he was always doing some creative stuff when he settled down a little bit right and in this one little bag was the board\nAnd it was the board because he felt guilty wanted to contact is dead victim's is that why you made the board\nThat's right if he was he was very scary person and I I think he was up to a lot of things and he would always do my dad he said he would always show pictures of girls that he was dating all the time you know ... and my dad thought that that was\nSolely because he thought he was homosexual and he and he told me when I got older than you thought those people that he had done things to do the pictures ... and so when we when he died\nWe went to the places I just remember it was kind of like an average looked in the house on the edge of the ... and they had\nAll his clothes and all that stuff and he had he was making posters to sell you know 'cause like in the seventies system and um they threw at all that stuff but I asked my uncle was like the\n... like an executive guy taking over the state where nothing of value but he let me have the board and he said this is explained that this was the thing that the that he built for that reason because when he had a very bad car accident\nAnd um they thought he was going to make it but he didn't make it and it changed his personality and my dad said that he got a conscience because he didn't have one even though he was like charming to us\nThere was some scary about him and then when he had the uh the accident it changed he changed ... that's when he made this you know he had some skill as an artist like a\nGraphic artist you know and\nThat's when he made the board and then he he basically left to the you know it\nWas just in the garage part he didn't I did when I took it took it [noise]\n\nAnd it's ... and ... and this is how you survive by making money off his ...\nYeah to some other stuff I'm trying to be like a writer but I'm not as any luck but this this is you know this is a real thing you know it really works\nAll right well we'll we'll talk about that come and we have a turning Dollman coming up to or she is the director of the talking talking more Historical Society we're going to have her on two would be you know you're hearing the story of Bob the serial killer who made\nFigured a certain clues in the board there all these little if it's it's unusual if you look at the border all the all the little clues but I don't have the answers to to most of them the one I just got the longitude and latitude one crime scene\nIs on the board that data she I think is true and then the uh he said the eyes my uncle felt that the eyes all the sets of eyes\nBecause the eyes ... each I was ... was a victim\nOh the eyes were each I was ... curve ours was a victim so there's a lot of eyes Seventeen eyes and that's on the license plate\nSo slowly putting down I mean I I've used it and it's been effective and for me but I don't use it for evil right or anything like that\nYou're using it to try and figure out the crimes that you're trying to using as a way to figure out what happened\nThat that I'm I'm very curious about that 'cause I'm trying to be a writer right I said it would make a good book but then in terms of our use it to talk to friends have departed not not like victims or anything like that but it's very effective it I've always talked to\nPeople if it really is my experience it might not ever worked for anybody else but it was worked for me\nRight so Karen I'm you have a board or you have three of them of Bobby board a and a used ones for you and then the other two were they going oh you said [noise] [noise]\nYeah so yeah thank you for seen those boards overeating um um so yeah and part of the ... Historical Society so one is going to be going to our museum a main museum ... museum they that travel and one's going to one of our collectors who does collect um oddities including serial killers ah stuff\nSo it's going to they're going to good homes and I'm a ... were the one in my my home that I have well I Will keep it a added to my collection cause I proudly display all the boards a house and use them all and I also\nAnd work with the board myself and I use it mostly with a partner but I can use it by myself so I'm curious to U. E. M. do you use it by yourself or with a partner\nOr both both 'cause I I don't have that many friends but I have one really good friend and she she'll you know we use is because of it I've used it alone but I think the company ... anything\nYou can send a divorce or with the company did yeah OK to\nCare and you say you use the board what uh what have you ah what kind of messages if anything have you gotten from the border that's come through\nBecause I Know it's it's an unconventional board I mean when you look at it it it's not like you know we were talking you know you have to ... compared to ... you can't because there's nothing like one actually I mean it's got the\nThe numbers in the letters and it has you know a true false who doesn't have yes no other number of other things on there too there are a little bit different than a unique and of course the plan shed is not really playing chess but a pointer um it it is I guess I don't know\nWhy don't you explain to me a little bit if I'm Talking out of line you're just explain a little bit about the board and what kind of experience you've had with\nThe care oh sure so the the pointer the indicator looks like a hand\nAnd it hasn't finger pointing up it's green and so that is what it points to point the letters instead of having an opening like a lot of the traditional we plant you have an opening to on this one has to plant some points to letters so real interesting thing about this for the people that are listening along\nIs that if this board is actually a collage so what do you have family had was a collage of you know you may cut out letters and numbers and out of you know out of magazines well that's what this is this person did he cut them out and and stuck into this board\nA and nothing was like a handwritten all this like everything was just cut out and I do see at the very top corner in the very bottom of right corners of that latitude and longitude I did see that right away to there there are definitely some unique symbols on here\nAre very cryptic in many regard but what it does have of course they have the full alphabet it's laid out very much like a wage aboard the fact that it does the arc\nA through em on the first line in a second line is in through the that's a that's a good lay out to have a I can use any plan chat with is um because literally that pretty nicely there they're large enough to but the numbers are above the letters and they're splitting part\nAnd there's some interesting symbols on here there's a giant faith in the middle of words that say I'm Sorry and then all the eyes that EM indicated so what I did I just got this board yesterday and I typically work my partner my partner wasn't around to work this tool so I went ahead and placed my hands upon the green hand\nAnd it just ... what spelled out west where if Bob that was it was like a question to me for something for me to think about and that didn't give me anything more than that\nAnd who I communicate mostly it's not the dead I used to and I'll talk a lot about that little bit further down the road but who I talk to him now it's just a group of guides I called the guide their group of of the Rio beans who have never been incarnate it in a body\nAnd they come through every time I use the board and that was their way to get us talking about this\nNow I Will say this Clyde and am I plan next week I'm doing a a a live a stay on for people\nI Do plan on using this board on Halloween with my partner and see what kind of other messages we get from it but I can tell you that any single board I ever touching it doesn't matter what they look like we're kind of symbol they have on it what kind of material it's made out of they all work and they all work the same for me every time\nI went out with my partner they it's always the same guys that come through no matter what\nThe intentions of the board I as it was created you know how ugly are critical of credit for different reasons it doesn't matter it will work for me on the level and which I intended to work and how I treat it and come to the board myself\nI'm and I'm looking on the board no I'm about\nTo face clock that's\nBob space okay here's\nThe piece I could tell you he always would it would have pieces and we weren't too more more more common than you know\nRight you're going to tell me that's a wig or somebody who's wearing on his face dish 'em it always says it says you speak closed door when finished so instead of saying goodbye once you say close the door to you open the door first to talk to the board says closed the door I'm just looking at all the things that are on your there is a little bit\nBut I think close the poodle that ... that was his car that's a picture of his car\nHa ha and then the guy is all over the border those guys the victims\nDarts at a ... foot I think it is true\nAnd I'm On July ... to ... that's on there a cactus all\nAll the different numbers some of the let us have the dots on them mhm and those Dutch stole something\nWhat about huh okay really mhm okay\nThen the the two that were says books\nAnd the two in West yeah north south east west bugs yeah uh-huh\nI put an ad for South I'm trying to put all that into a word [noise] I think yesterday so long I get frustrated but I think this is close to what he did dad was in there all this\nAnd there was a key a key symbol\nIn a bunch of schools at least two schools on you know I see three I see three golds okay I went the other one is on the very bottom can see that now that we can go ahead

heading between ... and Vancouver a little bit west of\nCameras right now and joining me is you know everywhere I go on a train you know there are the trains spotters there the train ... I'm a train geek I admit it I Love the history of the trains you know when you think about Dwight Eisenhower once said he said you know America didn't build the interstate highway system the interstate highway system built America look as what the\nTrains actually built America and they do the same thing here in Canada the trans Canadian railway system I mean legendary um why is it was ... listen to a good life for the record called her the Canadian railroad trilogy I'm really going back in time but it's one of my favorite\nSongs and joining me now another train ... I I I I think I can call them that he would share the board of directors of the west coast railway association always also on the train Don Evans Illinois\nI'm great that's great to be here Peter you're actually hitting home back to Vancouver I Am indeed yeah traveling on the track\nYou heard my introduction so let's talk about this I mean train travel is all about storytelling it's all about history it's all about ... living history that's what this train is all about letting people know about how things got from point a to point the about the process of how they actually built the railroads\nYea for Canada the railway was game changer or the country in the early days well British Columbia here it was a vast territory and natural resources not organized and there was a group of British Colombians that wanted to become part of Canada and candidate was interested in that too but in order to do that there needed to be a connection\nAnd by the way today we were talking about airlift back that it had been to the train\nIt had to be the train it was the only way in those days to ship large quantities of material long distances in and reasonable way\nAnd so that was that the creation and in British Columbia is case it actually brought the province in Canada so it was responsible for the creation of western Canada the link to the nation and that happened in Eighteen Seventy one when the province joined the confederation of Canada which at that time it was only four years old\nNow we're talking about the the beginning of the railroads encountered today we noticed via rail but I Know of course is Canadian Pacific\nYes and Canadian Pacific was the first transcontinental railway in Canada\nAnd it did connect the country from Atlantic Pacific so it was responsible for the creation of many of our communities the settling of the west the ships would come into Halifax on the east coast CPR would transport them in rudimentary common is sleeping cars\nDrop them off in the middle of nowhere and suddenly towns and economies develop and the real got business of course\nYou know if you look at the history of travel and transportation\nAnd the ... business of course\nYou know if you look at the history of travel and transportation in North America what do you find well the founder of ... of Pan Am one trip started intercontinental hotels are today Pacific railway down and they started their own hotel is that the railroad hotels\nYou had the the ... the the royal Yorker Toronto you had the ... springs hotel you had the Frontenac you had and then of course in on the west you had the hotel Vancouver these are all were the trains stop\nAnd they didn't just up there they didn't build that airline called sea Pierre this\nIs true well we'll come Cornelius van horn who was really the president who built the railway Eighteen eighty four Eighteen eighty five Eighteen eighty six in the west\nOr he once said you know we can't bring the mountains to the tourists do have to bring the people to the mountains and that was part of the thing and today the Rocky Mountain near actually plays that very same role\nWhile the Rocky Mountain your benefits from the amazing engineering of blasting through tunnels and and and solid rock to be able to build the first railroad\nUh that's absolutely true in the country benefits from the economic movement of goods that happens from the Pacific coast ports to the center of both Canada and the U.S and it's become a a vital vital artery for the country\nNow has many of my listeners know Amtrak has been challenged since it was formed because they don't own the tracks it's owned by the freight trains and the freight lines and they tend to get priority one of the reasons why Amtrak can't maintain it on time performance schedule and the long haul trays are always pulling over to assigning\nTo let some hybrid car freight train come lumbering on through it's the same situation in Canada isn't\nIt's absolutely the same situation you know the the freight traffic has grown exponentially and the shipping from overseas is happening and so a very very uh railroads are busier than they've ever been before and so the same circumstances happen\nRegardless whether you're running on the hour we're renting on Rocky Mountain near here it's just the reality of operating on the ...\nAnd yet you could actually track the history of Canada for every development of the train right the gold rush a you know modern communication or even the highway system\nYeah in fact native Pacific was the started very first trans continental telegraph lines so dies you mentioned with the hotels Canadian Pacific diversified very early they built the a big hotels to service the railway and bring the people to them and they built the telegraph system that started the communication system across the country\nWhat's the biggest challenge for the train buffs like you in Canada\nOh I don't know what are the challenges we'd love to have more trains to ride but\nA ... of the reason why I'm asking because we're seeing you know the the decrease in train service in America especially on the long haul ...\nYeah I think what you're seeing in the trip or doing today though is held that's transitioning away from a transportation based product more to a tourism base product and I think that is very agile that absolutely experiential\nLet's put it this way we are now on a train that has something like sixteen cars um and it's full we have over six hundred passengers who are here because they wanted to go between Baptist Vancouver they wanted to see Canada\nYeah they've come from all over the world to see what makes candidates so special and that's the amazing geography the diversity in the long distance as we have and what types things together and they're having a tremendous experience as part of that\nAnd this is quite frankly a luxury train experience\nI owe it very much is in top quality services you've experienced it's just a marvelous marvelous journey and ah the sites are amazing\nI mean a little bit later on the show had the chef on board but I mean he is on board but he'll be on the show on board\nI mean there's food here followed by more food followed by more food or the dome cars I mean I remember when I was a kid my very first train trip and there was one observation car it was literally the last caller on the train it was it was especially the caboose yes and you had to go all the way back to all the other cars and then you've got a chance with like Kodak Brownie camera\nTake very grainy photographs because if you move the camera everything we've got to focus I did get to see\nYeah yeah it sounds like my early experiences on the train to and it was a child in the fifties and sixties and traveling on this Dreamliners throat in North America and of course here in Canada we had the Canadian those super continental and they were among the best as well\nNow do you still have those in terms of ... the via rails\nYeah via real still operates a train called the Canadian that does go from Vancouver to Toronto on a three day a week basis\nAnd how long does it take to cross the country or four and a half days now wow wow and you get off and get on\nA while you get some breaks that a major stopped\nSo but what I'm saying is can you buy a ticket which allows you to get off and get on\nSorry yes of course you can absolutely ... so you can do across Canada and segment stopping at places like Edmonton in Winnipeg and Jasper\nI guess my question has to do with with with the Amtrak at this point you know if I read between the lines Amtrak once you get rid of most of the long haul ...\nWell it certainly has been a something that you see happening with their strategy is is I'm certainly not mind to comment on but a Amtrak's doing well in the corridors we have the Pacific northwest of the cascades quarter and I write that often but the long haul is a more challenging situation\nI mean if I had to guess you're not going to see who's ever around much longer the cardinal over the empire builder you're going to basically to see Northeast Corridor and Pacific coast corridor where they can actually make some money for a change\nYeah well but it's a real fan of course I Hope you're wrong and\nThat's why I asked about the challenges that we're\nSince then it's it's more into a a nationwide organization\nWe've got over nine hundred and forty six thousand that takes members what we call that pictures and we distributed over five point three million tickets since we started\nIt's really an amazing program and as I said\nI have now used vet ticks as you mentioned mixed martial arts that's one of my favorite sporting events to go do that actually worked in ... may as well there is a promotion in Maryland called show gun fights and there were tickets available there I entered for those tickets I received them and ended up paying something like\nFifteen dollars for tickets that what it costs three hundred I mean is it always that kind of a deal as an ... are are so many of them like you know coming down from hundreds of dollars down to Fifteen twenty bucks for a ticket\n... yeah absolutely and and so that's where the these tickets are donated their their donated by by donors and um\nThere there is a small transaction fee for for these tickets but it's never going to be more than fourteen dollars in Ninety seven cents and that's not for a ticket that's per transaction regardless of what the face value of those tickets are because number one I'm\nYou pay a couple of bucks for some tickets you got some skin in the game so you're going to go and that obviously makes our donors happy because they donate these tickets whether they want they want ... seats and in this case it's just it's veterans currently serving military their families having having a good time so\nAt that kind of um to get tickets at at that type of um\nDeal you can't go wrong\nYou really can't now what is the process for him for someone who's sitting out there are things what do I do I just go to the Web site and log on and there's tickets and I just click on them or are there different ways that people can get tickets or how do they go about it\nSo so to get tickets you have to be a vet six member and and we we call her back to its members of that picture so Eric you you you are that ticks or as I Do\nYes and um so what happens is is that you go to our website that fix dot org V. E. T. T. I. X. dot ORG upper right hand corner it'll stay creating account so you click on that\nAnd it it's going to ask you some questions and we verify your service\nOr either as currently serving military or a veteran honorably discharged veteran or the immediate family member a service member killed in action and so how we do that is id dot me is the verification process that we used for that so if you're already a member of ID me it makes it that much easier so\nIt takes three to five minutes to sign up it doesn't cost anything to sign up\nOnce you get signed up and verified\nThen you'll start receiving emails about events in your area so what happens is that when you in\nYour ah as you're signing up it'll say hey I Want to be notified of advance within a you know there's a drop down of X amount of miles within my location so you'll get daily emails every morning about advance in your area there's something you're interested in you click on that link and\nYou put in for the event and it's that easy\nIt really is quite pay was again I've gone through it wants now and I plan on going through it again when you keep an eye on it to see what we might be able to take the family too and there's no shortage of events in fact\nI remember a just a earlier this year during the college football's national championship\nA season as we were getting closer and closer to that game there were actually tickets to that event available through vet tech so you know this this isn't just a small local events or say a baseball game at the end of the season when the team is having trouble filling the stands there is a really major events aren't there Steve\nYeah absolutely I mean we had um we had two tickets donated to us by a vet picture or to the super bowl\nIn Minneapolis this past season so\nThere you you just never know what you're going to get\nA this is that ticks are huge Vikings fan bought bought the tickets or early in the season in the hopes that the Vikings were going to go when the when the Vikings um you know fell out of contention he had no desire to go so he donated them to that ... some\n... picture in the uh [noise] you know local Minneapolis area\nGutsy the super bowl two tickets for for Fifteen dollars so sometimes these tickets they might be up in the nose bleed or they might be courtside or\nBehind the dog out of the New York Yankees so you just never know what kind of take it you're gonna get\nStephen as I understand it you guys are growing significantly I mean there there's a lot of people signing up every day for the program that's going to be expanding even more because you guys recently I think just in the last couple of months and now you're going to include first responders and this is well is that right\nAbsolutely yeah spot on and so\nWhat we've done is we've opened this up to first responders so that includes a police firefighters and EMTs and um and there's there's the eligibility requirements there as well and that's through ID me\nAh you get verified it's the same exact process and if you're a first responder or you can\nGo to first ticks dot org one S. T. dot O. R. G. or you can even sign up on the vet chicks\nCage it it it doesn't matter it's transparent\nAnd you know air to the the reason why we do this is because we want it we want to give back we want to say thank you to to our service members are currently serving our veterans and and to our first responders because we know that what they do a ... is a very important job\nAnd so it's our way to to say thank you and you know spend some time with your friends with your family at an event for a couple of hours a day in an afternoon to to try to rebuild relationships maybe you are deployed you you\nYou went on a lot of deployments and so you missed a lot of birthdays or special events with your family\nSo by taking them to these events it's it's just a way to\nMake up for that last time\nWhen we return more of our conversation with the wind ... to expand first CBS I on veterans is back in a moment [noise]\nI'm now a page from the diary of a\nFew times that goes to this house is protected to progress [laughter] I mean how could you explain that radiator like climbing sound or the moon colored light in the hallway that's gone by morning revisiting never bundled home in auto and he's doomed suffering eternity was\nSeeping average Seventy percent on car insurance when you're going to home an auto through progressive\nThat we like say oh rank the land\nOf casually insurance company and affiliates does not available in all states are situations\nFlu season one long green flu shots and make a world of difference\nTheir situation this flu season one ... shots and make a world of difference so you can protect yourself and so you're close talking co workers help we fighting neighbors\nTwo month old niece that's why ... especially trained pharmacists could have provided over sixty million flu shots in two thousand and five for your flu shot today with a zero dollar coated with most insurance\nBecause protecting the world starts with protecting your ... justices said you know one that's being subject to availability state Asian health related restrictions may play\nNo\nMatter how modern your family might be if you're pedaling around bedrock and a gas engine vehicle you're living in the past\nThey charge the era of the electric vehicle has a ride with instant acceleration electric cars are more fun to drive and more affordable than ever electric cars are here again to the president learn more plug into the president dot com sponsored by both black in America\nThere's nothing small about your ... your passion your hours your reputation all huge\nYour partnership even\nWith Dell small business technology advisors you'll get the tax advice and one on one partnership to help your business ground because with a reliable ... these with intel core processor you can focus on what matters most getting business done\nIt seventh heaven by down to speak with an advisor today it's eight seven seven I don't\nKnow how much do you value your child's education\nWe also know how hard it can be sometimes can balanced important to that education with the cost that's why we hear Bryan broadcasting started the half price tuition campaign it's our mission to work with schools and learning centers throughout the Bryan College station area\nTo provide tuition for families that half the normal costs these authors are exclusive to us and the number of vouchers is limited we hear from people all the time how they wish they had some other options when it comes to their children educational opportunities right now we're offering\nHalf price tuitions votes Bryan College station location for\nMatinees am the math learning center the multilingual preschool academy language immersion early learning center and Sylvan Learning center of Bryan College station offering tutoring for grades K through trauma along with a C.

actually live here do you want more information on ice and elect to go to our website Peter Greenberg dot com which will also give you\nThe global is for wherever you happen to travel joining me now like I say there's about every one of my guess she's not a native\nShe's not from here but she's been here sixteen years from Virginia I Believe a she's a publisher of taught her weekly magazine Capitol Hill how are you good how are you okay so I can ... call your local not even a sixty\nYeah I think they count what brought you here well I came for a job interview in the area I took one look at the lake and decided I was going to take this job no matter what they wanted me to do basically underpaid yeah [laughter] yeah from the grocery store and they were getting ready to fight it\nBut you know when I hear about you know in any location that we go you know there's a weekly magazine I go okay what are they going to put in there I mean how much news could there be but you do have news\nWe have lots of stuff going on you know it is I always say the balance place for endless opportunities if anything you want to do and ... you can do it here\nAnd you've seen her last sixteen years change radically\nOh yes definitely there's a lot more to offered culturally outdoor recreation or events for people more opportunities to get out there and enjoy the like how do you enjoy like I'm a big hiker I also like to get on the lake and go out in the boat ... you know I also cross country ski and snow shoe but you name it you can do it\nHe All right so let's let's be real here when you have a board I'm assuming once or twice you have fallen in\nOh we've all fallen and actually ended up bitch release you actually are you working any kind of protective gear I usually do not but it's always a vital to have a life jacket but I think close to shore\nOr to say if we do not advise people go out beyond the movies because the depth Arizona control is adapting it goes really deep very fast and people can get hypothermia shock that we advise people at their ... stance that the movies it's less traffic less way it's very safe there\nFor people who don't understand the lake and it's always a shock for people who first timers yeah I was like yesterday\nPeople who don't understand the lake and it's always a shock for people ... yeah I was on them like yesterday it was almost glass ... today smoker mornings I mean it was as whip it up\nIt changes rapidly it's usually very windy and every afternoon but this time of year typically we do get very high winds you'll see a lot of surfers on the lake\nSo we are talking to the fear was Catherine Hill who doesn't work very wet food on the lake well at that is in the summer [laughter] what\nWas the biggest surprise for you when you first got here and what's the biggest surprise for you right now but\nI think the biggest surprise when I first moved here first experience Lake Tahoe was the beauty just the sheer beauty I was overcome by it and just do I had to make this part of my life\nCan I show like a really bad brochure for sure uh we're over the phone number ... ... on the phone number ... ... and I'm sure the light was just perfect I mean we didn't plan it\nThat way but it was an you sit out there with the wind in your face and you can she unstructured for miles all the way across the lake with no high rises known the on Sunday no nothing but greenery and hills and Scott ... and if that is the most productive thing I don't know what else is\nIt is that's exactly what it is you know you're just ... and living here you'd never get tired of it every single day it takes your breath away\nSo that was your first surprise when you first go yeah no what is\nThe the amazing community and ... the locals that live here the locals that make this part of their life is just it's a great community not only and the fact that they love to preserve the lake in the mountains and the land that surround it but just in\nHelping each other and building community here and hosting events to bring other people to enjoy this beauty so that we can live here\nIn other cities or locations like this or you can't tell a similar story sometimes because the development of the true story or out of control of the the the rush for for faster money investor revenue\nOr is out of control the height of the buildings signage or what they do with waste water yeah all those things here that's different\nYeah it's very different here there's a lot of agencies or by state agencies to Tahoe regional planning agency locals agencies\n... cooperation between the two state yeah that was that the leaders were unique about it and in California mhm\nAnd they just work together to preserve a you know the beauty of ... ultimately all of our goals is to keep those major developments from spoiling the magnificent beauty that's here\nAnd we haven't mentioned restaurants ... I mean when I first came to a I'm not making this up when I first came into cheeseburgers maybe\n[laughter] yeah no I Would agree I'm Talking about Nineteen Seventy five I think\nSeventy six I mean fish was basically fraud mhm right we'd gone a long way\nYeah tall is amazing eateries now for every level every cuisine there's growing all the time it's become really a foodie area\nAnd yet it's still seasonal you have a lot of restaurants that were close at the end of this month and yet fewer than a fewer and fewer closer ...\nCorrect and just seeing you know less shoulder season which is then all of the locals working together to bring more visitors to come in October November and the spring months you know it's when it's beautiful and there's not as many people as they\nWere talking a chance to heal the publisher of taught her weekly magazine so since you've been here for sixteen years I I figure I could ask you this question about your favorite places to go which is it's it's all are on food you know there's [laughter]\nBreakfast uh my personal favorite of Donnelly kitchen they've been around for a number of years and what are your order I order something called the hot flour tortilla which is a wave us ranchero without eggs and other places in Truckee replaces the turkey on Donner like\nOver in tracking have um been around for a number of years and they have excellent bloody Mary's as well\nSo basically the the the hell with the uh the tortilla it's the\nBloody murder the [laughter] ... admitted for more than excellent food but the bloody Mary death [laughter] this is held captive he'll start today okay what about what\nA lunch one of my favorite places to go to a super it's in the village at squad valley and they make homemade soups daily wow what particular ship it varies it depends kind of what they have seasonally I\nLike their tomato bays old but they also do a lot of really interesting up potato chips gender suits but it's it's very seasonal very fresh and then um I always like to get the grilled cheese with the hot pepper jam\nOr let's talk about grilled cheese I you know I have a my metric for places if they can do a good grilled cheese yeah cause other ... kept screw up but you can\nYeah right yeah I could really screw grilled cheese sandwich I agree what makes their grilled cheese sandwich or good I think it's\nAnd there are some countries I mean this is even more absurd weren't being South Africa that if you don't have at least two blank pages in your passport you won't be allowed to enter either\nSo we were then your passwords within six months of exploration get a new one okay and then comes one of the state department is warning to keep your medications in their original labeled containers not those generic go boxes with ... times and there's a reason for that because nobody knows what's in the ... one\nBut even if you take your your pills and medications and their origin\nNobody knows what's in them over one but even if you take your your pills and medications in the original label containers I Want to add another piece of advice that your doctor gives you a separate typewritten note that identifies why you're taking your particular medication as well as listing the drug by a generic not just its brand name\nBecause you don't want some overzealous customs guy pulling you aside for three hours trying to explain something that they don't understand right please do that and these are State Department warnings that I actually think are pretty good\nSo there you have and let's go to sort of your emails or one in particular a chain from Scott Miller who writes a Hi Peter uh I just read your article in the June edition oh you're a little late there Scott\nOf the Cosco magazine as well and was wondering where are you a volunteer firefighter or I Am a retired firefighter in Southern California and I've always wanted to live somewhere where I could be on a volunteer fire department well here's the good news got\nBefore I tell you where the laundry firefighter remember this Seventy four percent of all firefighters in America or volunteer people don't realize that people don't realize you know started volunteer fire departments Benjamin Franklin and Peter Stuyvesant back in the New York\nThe old bucket brigades a and outside of New York city or just give you an example an overwhelming number of fire departments are not paid the partners they're volunteer it's the butcher the bigger the candlestick maker and you're truly so the answer your question I'm a volunteer firefighter on the island to fire island in New York\nAnd for those who don't know it far owners thirty two miles long never gets more than a third of a mile wide Nineteen communities are far out\nAnd twelve of them minor among them has a fire department as you can imagine and we're all mutual aid we help each other out and uh it's wild but so so necessary and it's not just fires it's\nA emergency medical situations and medical evacuations and in the case of Syria storms were the guys doing the mandatory evacuations as well\nOr the other thing that's important is that anybody can be a volunteer firefighter you certainly have to be on the truck there are so many other things you can do to help out in every community needs you a volunteer firefighters have a recruiting issue they need more around the country and Scott wherever you are now or I'll guarantee you\nThere's a volunteer fire department that would benefit greatly from your expertise and you're and you're ... years of experience\nSo I I Hope you get a chance to do that and and write me let me know when you volunteer 'cause all will shouted out on the on the air up here's one from Joe Miller who writes\nWe're leaving New York city for Aspen, Colorado for two weeks the car rental prices for the two weeks in Aspen are so regular it makes it difficult to decide what his what help kayak is the least expensive but the pick up pointed sketchy could be the Aspen airport or some other point\nCan you help me how do we get the best place in a guaranteed airport\nWell let me help you out\nFirst of all aspects you know the airport in essence very close to downtown\nDowntown such as it is in Aspen uh and chances are that is where you got to pick up the the car in bigger cities that's not always the case in bigger cities or it may not be a good idea to to run the car at the airport that you're paying the premium for their expensive rent that they have to pay the airport to have their walks out there\nAre the best way to do this as long as you want to do it on line\nThis is where price line can be very very effective uh because at the end of the day what do you want\nAn engine for tires and something that runs a they don't need to know if it's eight us hurts national enterprise whatever right you just want a reputable company that what you were crowded at a reasonable price enough

Myrtle ... please please please let's talk about ... or things to talk about anything you'd like to as long as it pertains to landscapes gardens house plants Avi horticultural that's my\nBailiwick and I'll do my best\nI'd love to hear from you let me give you that phone number one more time eight eight eight to five six ten eighty eight eight eight to five six ten a fee for the Texas law and garden our\nAs we begin to fill the phone lines let me describe a let me describe brown page to you so you have said Augustine turf ended is starting to have unusual spots in it\nYou look out there one day and you see some yellow away in the grass just kind of sprinkled around in the grass it's early enough in that yellow knowing that you don't really think about the fact that those are in circles\nOr anywhere from twenty or twenty two inches to\nTwenty eight inches thirty six inches in diameter but they're almost exactly round almost expect somebody took an old fashioned metal garbage can and laid it down on top of the green St Augustine and then they can and got the lid got hot\nAnd that just kind of scores to St Augustine well that's not what's happening because you don't have a mental garbage can and you're not doing that to your St Augustine but the effect has the same and ah about three days later\nBut you need to get all that digging in transplanting finalized\nGet it finished up because you never know when that first frost will come parts of Texas way north in the panhandle have already headed killing freeze they've been down in the in the mid to hide twenties\nOr most of Texas has not yet but it won't be much longer and so go ahead and finish up are digging and dividing of your perennials get them re planted tidy up the perennial garden you don't want to leave things crowded you certainly don't want to leave them untidy\nSo if you have a for example ah if you have\nA a place that are dying back\nMaybe can is to have a lot of the dead leaves or other other plants that sort go ahead and trim those off there's no point leaving did stumble on your plants keep him tied to keep them looking good\nAnd uh if you're thinking about adding some perennials you want to add some new things this is a good time to add the spring flaring perennials if it the blooms in the spring added in the fall of ... that blooms and the fall you edit the spring it's the old rule of thumb\nSo let's go to Wendy intake is we have a windy on the line when did this is Neil good morning how may I help\nYou in the morning now I planted to Rosa Sharon ... this year the spring I one gets away the morning than like the other one get direct sunlight\nBut one that is getting direct sunlight did not believe in is how does not have very many leaves on it I cannot think take her out what I'm doing wrong\n[noise] um\nHow much new growth did you have on the two comparatively\nThe one only getting the morning sun not no other son but the point that it's gotten gotten maybe two feet tall they share and it's just full of blue and full of ...\nPretty green Lee ... about the full sun when it did not hardly even grow any are the same variety they are the same variety and everything\nI'm guessing that the one in Folsom probably got to dry at some point Wendy or even early in the season and really suffered from that installed out and just didn't have the own to to re grow that would be my guess okay\nShould I dig it up and try again next spring\nI don't know I Can't see it so I don't know uh if if you feel like it might have gotten to dry and if you feel like there is a a good bit of vigor left in it then I might prove it a little bit ah when when the plane I'm I'm guessing this is a wild guess without seeing it\nBut if a if a plane is to dry than there is route loss in the process and therefore I'm\nUh you probably need to remove some of the top to compensate for the justice\nUh you probably need to remove some of the top to compensate for that just as if you had dug the plant in some roots off and then it very often will take right often grew will the next year in fact that it's out in the sun it it would be logical to think that it would need more water than the plant that was in\nA minute or so eating more water and the other one\nOkay [noise] um they they can tolerate full sun most of the really nice lose that you see around Texas are in full or nearly full sun but I've seen plenty of them in in half a day of sun that have done very well this year was a rough year for a Rosa Sharon\nAll kinds of hide discussed and their relatives have a nasty habit of a boarding a flowers or or or maybe not even getting much to the\nThe flowering stage when they have really hot dry conditions and one of the things I've always noticed on Rosa Sharon is it puts buds on in may when conditions are really nice and then when it turns hot in June that's about the time\nThat it starts to open those birds and if if we then suddenly turned really hot\nLike we did in two thousand Eighteen than they aboard a whole bunch of those buds are just all over the ground I saw that in the in the middle third of the state where I live I don't know how it would have been in and take us\nBut um as low humidity as you guys have I I can only imagine it might have been the same thing but I Would try a trimming it a bit and watering really heavily and I'd leave it where it is unless the soil is terrible or something ...\nWell they they they can make that they both are in college he correct correct\nI'm just trying to think of things that one has the other doesn't have and and uh the only thing I'm hearing is is the difference in lighting and may be there for a a a little better water availability and the the ... partly shaded one I'd try that\nOkay thank you\nYou are welcome they're lovely play itself it it'll do well for you go to John in ... bay and I got to find out where ... bay is I Know where one is worries years\nA bath in Bay is uh the neck large body of water South Korea\nGot you All right\nYeah so down here on a ah most of my yard has crashed granite and then I got ... ways that are are most of the artist Christ limestone walkways\nJust rent it and I fight or every week you know I I I've got a free American\nI've also just battle with roundup and manage just will not go way\nThis has been the year spurred age I think John in in forty one years of I'm Sorry forty seven years of doing a Q and a on radio I probably had more splurge calls this year than the other forty six years combine honest to gosh I've said that several times in the last two or three weeks because\nIt's just it's really been I was out taking photos of it in a landscape this this morning um [noise]\nThe the suggestion that I Would have is what you just mentioned and that is to use the life has said on it when it's small when it's just getting started um it it's seed is very tiny and it's gonna wash and blow in easily I don't know that there is a preventive\nUh some years will be worse than others I I Do think now it may be that you're in an area where there's so much of it that you're always going to have it but I I really would think that if um if you can just make a regular habit of spring it with\nWith the life has said I think you can get rid of it when it's so tiny it's such a fine textured we'd yeah and uh that's going to be that would be my solution that's what I Do in my driveway is what I Do in in my walkways when I see it as I used to spray it I have a lot of pine bark mulch pathways\nAnd I'll just use a ... when the pathways dry and I'll just drag the ho through it and in snap and they only has one big tap rude\nBut lord it ought there are\nWhat ... what happened what would happen if you put some more the this is decomposed granted switch you using and part of you know what would happen if you talk to her is that with a little bit more and you could just rake it to it when it's tiny those little seedlings are are going to be easily broken and and just lift to dry in the sun for a couple of hours\nYeah you know so maybe you need for explode\nYeah at the time and I thought I'll as time goes and the and the and the walk past where I'll I'll sell some young and or\nIs it easier to maintain after you do that for a while\nA you know I think it just continues to come up with ... as we walk on the on the past than the um it gets ... you know not hard to disrupt that just didn't know if there was a\nMagic wand yeah [laughter] but\nI'm very emergent and I don't know yet I've I've got good coverage when I put it out yet pop back up\nI don't see pre emerging there's your answer I really don't because I think it's going to wash out of that area too fast and it only lasts for Ninety Days or a hundred days I think the fly for say is is your best bet enjoyed it\nVery effective on no doubt yeah it's part of the\nPart of the routine that's my major you answer that is not very major I worry that brings All

is trying to come up with the way to combat that what did you come up with\nBelieve it or not federalism Hillary Clinton one of the great advocates a federal power of the modern era she is now discovering federalism again amazing how this works Donald Trump comes along suddenly Hillary Clinton and the left are discovering the states are kinda great\nHere's what she tweeted yesterday in reality they should bring court with the right one majority is it the state or new important front in protecting civil rights especially the right to the most vulnerable among us is that really a new\nImportant front in protecting civil rights\nOr does it turn out that the states were always an important front in protecting feel right now folks are going to say well\nThink about the fact that states where it's possible for him that true it was also states that were responsible for failing to abide by the fugitive slave act and an Eighteen fifty leading to the civil war the federal government was trying to force state in the north to abide by the fugitive slave act fixing the north refusing to abide by the fugitive slave\nStates are only as good as the people who comprise them and their policy is only as good as the people comprised them the one thing that is certainly true is that the United states as a mixed\nState and and national system as it is putting federal thirty nine or they mixed system state governments are designed to preserve the sensuality of locality in American Jurisprudence\nAnd the fact that the west is only now realizing this as soon as somebody who's in office they don't like the head of the federal government demonstrates just have this on if they are because here's the thing Hillary Clinton and her ... if they ever gotten charge against how long do you think they stick by the state's rights proposal how long do you think they'd be in favor of states right answer is five seconds five seconds\nAt the left is just dishonest about all the stuff that same left they proclaimed that Donald Trump is just on a visit to John when Hillary Clinton says she likes states right now what Hillary Clinton mean is that she wants to use any obstacle to prevent President Trump governing which has actually believe in states rights and she actually believes in states right\nAnd presumably should wanted the evolution of ... to the states from the federal government across the board including\nIf she had been president we all know that that was never going to happen\nWill know that was never going to happen instead the truth as well Democrats really want is to copy the policies of Scandinavian countries where people forget to tell you this but the policy and Scandinavian countries is not just the math and social welfare state they math and social welfare state paid for by enormous\nUnbelievably high taxes\nThe taxes and places like Denmark and Norway fifty to sixty percent on everybody making more than fifty or sixty grand a year\nWe're not talking about taxes on just the wealthy even folks on the left are not willing to be honest about what exactly would take the paper all the crap that they are talking about instead what they will do is they'll just kick the can down the road so what exactly are they proposing\nSo they're not really proposing federalism and they're not obviously proposing back based legislation\nIs proposing spending a lot of money so now we're going to get in the twenty twenty primaries from the Democrats who can spend the most cash so we have come out like Harris is proposing giving every poor family five hundred bucks based on\nNothing we we really don't know where that money is going to come from how they're going to spur the economy any of that stuff\nCory Booker says well why do five hundred why not do a hundred times five hundred let's get everybody in grant\nSo why not give me five hundred grand by the way my five million largest helicopter pallets of cash over newer ... cash I mean hopefully people get out of the way now there'll be crushed by money and die happy apparently the idea of recording Booker\nDo according to box which is the repository of all things stupid that's not to say that everybody at boxers do but there's intelligent poked box of all why they remain there is beyond the\nSenator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor is idea is to get lower income kids a sizable mess deck nearly fifty grand in some cases that they couldn't use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition is opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have to get the get out that's when they enter adulthood\nRather than just those who grew up in wealthier home\nWell you know what this particular proposal relies on people to use money well you know what else relies on people to use money well basic reason and free market so dropping cash on people without actually using that cat for the purposes is counterproductive coming up the president of the United\nStates sweets his response shooting migrants her van bearing down on America has its southern border is he right well yeah he kind of it from the fact that Democrats refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the United states over our own boys what ... what is a venture ocean\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win honestly she even Lindsey Graham was a real job on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously one of the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration form even he said listen\nThis is not something we can do Nancy Pelosi would welcome these tournaments I don't know what happened Lindsey Graham whether he bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham to point out of the reach that is really good and here's Lindsey Graham senator from South Carolina sing Nancy Pelosi will welcome these caravans\nYou want to be the country of people that run you up and down the hall and spit on you or do you want to be a country of a of of of Republicans who can actually deliver for working families out there that will put good judges on the court that will stand up to to the enemies of this country Nancy Pelosi will welcome the caravan fear\nA Donald Trump and the rest of us will stop them\nOkay well that that is exactly right and that's not at a black of sympathy because a country that has a rule of law must abide by that rule of law Democrat to continue to push the tissue are going to lose it's funny because Democrats are so ensconced in their own bubble in one poll shows that Democrats have park you'll Republican front than Republicans have Democrat front\nBecause Democrats live in areas actually she Republicans as nasty evil human beings and so they won't even talk to them\nThey actually believe that it's a mainstream view that people should be able to flood into the country\nThey actually believe that it's a mainstream view that gender insects are completely separate and not only that that if a man calls himself a woman that that man is than a woman\nThe latest evidence of this is I mean there's an amazing story is the way the media are covering an attempt by the department of education to to find what title nine actually says so here's the headline from the New York times today it says transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nNow when you read that headline what does that sound like you it sounds like the Trump Administration is saying they're no such thing as transgender people or people who suffer from\nGender just for your gender identity disorder that's what it would generally from that headline is that what's actually happening no that's not what's actually happening because that duty on it\nAnd nobody is saying there aren't people who are transgender what the Trump Administration is saying that under the law law that have to do with sex discrimination or specifically focused on biological sex they're not focused on you thinking your member of a different sect so when the civil rights act was written and it included language about\nMen and women and sex discrimination it did not mean that had a sex discrimination\nFor you to say that a man who shows up in a classroom a fifth grade classroom dressed as a woman\nAnd you say that's not cool we're not going to do that that's not the same thing as saying a woman can't work in the classroom that's not sex discrimination and that's that's what the Trump Administration is saying they're saying that you have your by men is not the same as being female\nThat's the actual what I'll read the actual article it doesn't it doesn't ban transgender people that's not what they're doing\nThe media is so dishonest with regard to how they cover transgender issues because they refused to even acknowledge the fact that there is such a thing as biological sex it's orderly self defeating what the what the ... the gender insects are exactly separate but gender is sex\nOr gender insects are completely separate you can be a man but your gender is female and that makes you a biological female that makes you an actual woman this is how they want to read the law and make no sense under any circumstances I explain in just one second they think he's a winning issue I mean it's just it's insane it's insane\nBut first let's talk about your online security with all the recent news that online security breaches kind of talk not to worry about where my day to

President Trump railed the fake news this is what he's talking about the sort of headline from the New York times transgender could be defined out of existence under Trump Administration were just going to disappear the transgender is now\nNow that is not what they're doing here is what they're doing quote the Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWell because gender is biological and immutable and it is delivered at birth\nNow what the what is that if they've redefined the terms one of the great ... areas of confusion in the transgender debate is what the hell everyone's talking about really I mean that because sometimes when people in general what they mean it expressed feminine or masculine qualities and sometimes what they mean is actual sex\nAnd it is impossible to tell which unless they actually sponsored by and then they shifted definition based on what they want their point to be the what is really the one making the case it only two genders they're saying that if you're a feminine and you're actually a woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually and then\nIf you wanted to find gender as just expressed characteristics of femininity or masculinity there are seven point three\nGender is just expressed characteristics of femininity or masculinity there are seven point three billion genders on planet earth which means meaningless toward the means nothing if you want to say that gender has to do with biology\nNow you have to separate it and in fact sex is based on y chromosome than X chromosome now they're intersects people and they're very very small percentage of the population that is not the argument being made by transgender advocates air arguing that you can be fully genetically male and female\nAll of this technological sense it's completely confusing because it makes no sense there was no internal consistency are logic infringe gender civil rights movement they can't even find different\nIf they simply want to say people should be treated well I'm with you if they want to say that I have to pretend that a man who says he has a woman has won a Caitlyn Jenner is just as much of a woman at my wife gave me a freaking break and everyone would half a brain on planet earth noted that\nBut here's what the New York times that\nA series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal programs including an education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth personal sex assigned at birth dumbest term in the world knows a gender assigned at birth at least now you're being consistent with the terminology\nBut even that that you can see the terminology shifting\nRight there's gender and then there's ...\nYou don't sign a second at birth babies are born they are what they are when my girl was born she was a girl I did not sign her girl you know assigned her girl genetics God that was sort of baked in you know I Know 'cause she's a girl my God people and the same thing with my son when he was born\nYou know I knew he was a boy I looked at him\nWow this was difficult and it turned out he is in fact the boy amazing coincidence he comes out he has all male characteristics and he's also a boy\nUnreal just amazing\nAlmost scientific ooh okay so here's what they say the policy prompted by of our bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arenas or gender was once seen as a simple concepts conservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times and served as especially evangelical Christians went sense this is their way of slandering religious people as they can\nThey not people who actually use their brain and recognize there are men and women and these are two separate category\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that want our main women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those groups and the same thing for men's group\nAnd the same thing for bathroom no it must be the ... it was crazy people believe in Jesus if those people the people if it weren't for those crazies leaving the gene is then it would then everything would be fine and we can all acknowledge the men and women are exactly the same except for a little bit of appendage and blow\nAnd here's the New York times and now here's the bad stuff okay what the bad thing that tremendous ration that\nNow the department of health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under title mine a federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education programs that will receive government financial assistance according to a memo obtained by the New York times\nThe department argues and it's a memo that the government agencies needed to adopt and explicit and uniform definition of gender is determined on a biological basis and it's clear grounded in science objected and administrative all\nAgencies propose definition would define the fact that he's a male or female and changeable and determined by the generals a person is bored with according to a draft review by the time and just being about one sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing\nHow in the world that not just basic rationality and claim your woman I should be able to objectively tell whether you're a woman or not it shouldn't be up to ... it shouldn't be up to you to decide\nAnd it's amazing to me that the same let that has now come around you Elizabeth Warren is not a Native American because not well she says she's a Native American widens you Native Americans you should they why not she's more Native American and Caitlin generous woman so what exactly is the problem here\nIt's truly amazing so you wonder why the right doesn't trust the media you wonder why people are resonating to the right it's because of what instead that we\nAbsolutely ... bottom eyes ourselves on basic concept like what is a woman and what is a man and we're supposed to pretend to great evil when the Trump Administration says gender discrimination means discriminating against women not discriminating against men believed there when\nIt's an amazing thing coming up I actually want you analyze the new law in the United states\nUnder title nine wasn't specifically meant to protect women was specifically mentioned feminine may or may who believe they are women pretty obvious from Texas a statue what exactly is it something in the long it'll

Mazie Hirono center from Hawaii when President Trump said that he's national she says maybe it's because he's a white supremacist or an anti Semite\nWe should stop giving him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand what he means when he refers to nationalist or\nAny of these other terms that these are not just dog whistles lettuce both lines it's racism is basically for many people as a um anti Semitic as white supremacy he knows very well what he's talking about even if he professes otherwise\nOkay Mazie my antenna is pretty high up there for for anti Semitism when the president said nationalism\nI'm not hearing nothing he's saying that he prioritize the United states is border security over the human rights of people trying to make their way across the board and made it to agree with that but there's no way that has anything to do with race is ranting to them but this became the actual talking point across walk yesterday\nJim Acosta CNN and waiting to find you somebody who loves you like him a cost of loved him some Kim Acosta here is Jim Acosta thing well maybe when President Trump's his national it he means white nationalist\nOkay or maybe when Jimmy Carter says stuff I just think that he's an idiot ears dumb Acosta\nWhen you're demonizing middle Easterners and making the suggestion that they're they're terrorists and so on in that care run without offering any proof and then call yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo much journal is making so much objective journalism in there from Jim Acosta only if anyone or that people asked whether the president denouncing when he when he said things like we should protect our borders and nationalism\nMean flashback you rock Obama two thousand ... same thing Brock Obama actually right here is Obama circuit two thousand five when he was just a senator barely a glimpse of the nation die there he was saying exactly the same thing that Donald Trump\nOr a generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally and those were for them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or become immigrants in this country\nOkay so uh you know again that I get that rock Obama way back when was that sort of white nationalist also you know being half white I get the he was white nationalist as well it wasn't just Jemma Costa who at this point basically everything that he that should be practiced with your diary\nBecause he says all the quiet stuff out that it was also anything is Peter Alexander more objective journalists being from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nYeah it definitely does mean under tones that are not just racial Xena phobic this is something that the presence of sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on him\nNow with it I'm somebody who said that I prefer patriotism to nationalism I don't think the nationalism alone is enough I think there are tied that bind up\nIt ties of history and culture but what actually make the United states the United states is the root idea embedded in the declaration of independence and the constitution backed by two thousand years\nOf Judeo Christian History or rather three thousand years in jail Christian History and that's what makes the United states the United states and the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism and that's what makes the United states' unique\nData unique idea in world history so I'm not such a big fan even of the president using nationalistic language but you suggest as white supremacy is just idiot\nBut again this comes back to the basic idea you want to raise the temperature in the country you want to raise the the the hackles of people on the other side\nAll you have to do is just a question motives day in and day out and that's what we are now in the business of doing the truth is that in a country where we agree on Ninety percent of our values we really do I think in the end a grand Ninety percent of our valley the only way you can divide up by\nCastigated people disagree with you on the manifestation of those values and evil nasty bigoted horrible people coming up to CNN\nBelieves President Trump is responsible for these heated rhetoric that leads to violence but in and obviously doesn't have clean hands here either it seems like a lot of political hypocrisy on both sides when the real world should be I'm not fighting violence and not responsible for violence will talk about it and then fear of\nWe listened with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we'll take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people an editor on building however President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that can do an act of violence\nTime and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body slammed reporter the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville his supporters of rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world murder their own citizens and referring to the free press\nAnd the enemy of the people now I think President Trump says a lot about stuff how 'bout that unclear about this but you're actually going to blame him for this bombing ... this is this is what you're going to do now\nI can remember somebody Nancy Pelosi just a year and a half ago was asked about Steve ... nearly being shot to death he almost died okay who's in critical condition he almost died\nIt's a miracle that live here is Nancy Pelosi saying how dare you blame us or Bernie Sanders for heated rhetoric that could've been connected with the guy going on to a baseball field and shouting as he gunned down members of Congress\nAbout health care and food is doing he was he was standing there screaming about health care while even tried to murder members of Congress there was Nancy Pelosi's response time she was right then she's not right now what's the difference now she gets to target right winners\nHow dare they say such a thing how dare they are so this sick individual does something despicable and it was horrible what he did hateful lie for them to all the sudden the sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before\nIt's just it's it's just amazing so she's reverse I mean I Wonder what changed oh what changed his who was going to get one that is what change so there is no such thing as a sword that cuts both ways all we have in the United states at this point are a bunch of habits at blunt on one end directed toward you and sharp on the other end directed toward your opponent\nWe don't recognize that what we're actually holding in a store and if you use it on your opponent can easily be turned back on you\nEvery source has two edges but according to the left it's just the hatchet and you can bury it in the twin shoulder blades of your political opponents Hillary Clinton does the same thing so the former first lady senator presidential candidate she says listen as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric\nSay well that's a person I'm great as an American I'm worried I worry about the direction of our country I worry about what kind of world will be waiting for them\nWhen they're sees\nTeenagers and young adults and beyond\nOkay and it wasn't just Hillary Clinton thing as a top aide Felipe range who is really one of those ... people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blame President Trump's rhetoric for all of this\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's Twitter feed and made it into a hit list he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his um vitriol\nOkay so next time somebody who's a big Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up an office run beta Fox News studio then I guess we can blame Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil with the other side\nIs legitimately what the date today today is the twenty fifth okay so ... ... fourteen days ago Fifteen days ago Hillary Clinton said that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican seemed to recognize and respect is strength\nHey everybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap will get to the fullness of the crap in just one second\nBut first let's talk about what you do to get ready every evening I Love the dollar shave club has everything I Need to look steel and smell my best friend long you been more the fact I never have to go to a store using that stores you have to wait in line you have to find the product you have to

we've got a bunch of stars that you can try for five bucks like\nThe oral haircut effort that restock box ships regular size products at a regular price so what are you waiting for get your stars that for just five bucks right now a dollar shave\nClub dot com slash been that dollar shave club dot com slash then again\n... everyone is full of crap including\nAndrew Cuomo and bill de Blasio both of them came out and they said listen we have to turn down the temperature in this country and has to start at the top\nWeird I remember when bill de Blasio was saying that police officers were just shooting black people for no reason and I remember when Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York that everyone who disagrees with my politics should get out of state is not an exaggeration he said that there is no place in the state of New York for you if you don't believe in same sex marriage and his views on social issues\nLet me explain if you are sitting around today and uh going it's always the rhetoric on the other side that problem\nBy freaking near\n... everybody has a role in temping down some of the rhetoric here\nEverybody does and that also means that\nBlaming the other side and suggesting that the other side of responsible for violence is meetings way worse country\nIt's so funny everybody thinks they're fighting violence when they suggest the other side is responsible for violence when they just use mainstream political rhetoric you're actually increasing the chances of violence when you do that because you are eating everything up you're suggesting the other side is so evil at the very ... of their ideas is likely to lead to death and destruction\nThat isn't that that's an on American perspective on American Bernie Sanders' can say whatever the hell he want no matter how wrong he is in a much he's actively saying ... people on the congressional baseball feel that it's not his ball and Donald Trump can say whatever he wants and you don't have to like it or whatever\nAnd you don't have to like it or whatever Donald Trump says\nHe has the right to say that's a long and he's not saying go beat up somebody right now go bomb some place right now\nIf I found weary of all of us just because I Am weary of all this really I mean if we're going to have any sort of level headed conversation when it has to stop blaming each other for every crazy person who does a crazy thing\nAnd I felt really really ... let's stop making the country worst place and other new NBC News is actively hyping it Megan Kelly blackface thing\nIt's really stupid it's really stupid speaking of stupidity in politics to Megan Kelly we talked to yesterday Megan Kelly that on a show that she doesn't really understand why this woman who was in the real housewives of whatever why this woman\nWas in trouble for dressing up as Diana Ross at a party because when she was a kid he believes the dark and their skin for Halloween costumes and wasn't a big deal and a bunch of folks that well black guy has a long and in glorious history in the United states that incentive dish that you know what I learned something today that insensitive I was wrong\nThat seems like that to the end of story does anyone really believes making Kelly's approval mission racist they don't actually believe that\nOf course nobody believed that nobody actually believed that Megan Kelly thinks black people are inferior genetically and that black people are worth black people are morally culpable at a higher level than white people or any of that no one actually believe that at NBC and it just shows you that capitalism one used by bad people\nYou know not great OK NBC wants to get rid of making Kelly they want to get rid of making Kelly because they tried to push Megan Kelly and play by that it's not properly fitted for Megan Kelly may until it is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question and a former lawyer and prosecutor that is where her role as best they tried to fit her into decay correct fluff morning news routine\nAnd that didn't work for them and to the ratings were not good and so they had signed her to an inordinate amount of money and now they're trying to push out the door how are they doing not by actually by actively stoking racial resentment in the United states and its ugly stop\nNews is now saying they're going to air taped episode of making show this week and then they are going to terminate her contract based on her saying that she didn't understand what the big deal was about somebody darkening their face for Halloween costume\nThat anyone really believe that the NBC bras is really upset about that or their boycott is on his way or that this was actually vicious brutal KKK style racism they would actually think that no of course not to NBC News trying to stoke racial resentment for purposes of being able to fire somebody\nAnd then the head of NBC News Andy lack openly ... into Kelly after she apologized she apologized and then lack that or there is no other way to put this but I condemned those remarks there is no place on our air or in the workplace for them very unfortunate and then Lester Holt cover her comments on NBC nightly news\nAnd says NBC decided to eat their own by going after making Kelly it's amazing how convenient at it\nAnd no one on CNN criticizes CNN nobody on NBC News criticizes NBC News unless they're preparing your shop somebody up and throw them into whichever and that's basically what NBC is doing here I Wonder why nobody trust me I mean this this it really is a great media story of just how corrupt the media are\nThere is no question that NBC is just that something could flame the planes here in Oregon that they can make a move by making Kelly that they wouldn't otherwise be able to make contractually so well done over at NBC making the country worst place they can save some money on a host that you yourself boxed in the wrong way coming up\nThe president of the United states is using his cell phone
