thing in the morning rather than in the heat of the day is it less evaporate well all liquids like gasoline expand when they're heated Mm So according to this advice gasoline would be more dense\nIn cold weather you guys have never heard this but I have now is you get and of course just because we have one cold day doesn't mean that they'll get it now yeah the liquid in a tank in the ground is going to get cold yet but if you have cold weather for a long time does that become cooler and does that does that make a difference in the basic facts are correct\nBut the advice is not according to Consumer Reports\nGasoline does expand and contract\nA little bit depending on the temperature when the gasoline rises from for instance sixty Seventy five degrees\nThan the increasing the volume is one percent and that's Fifteen degrees to make one percent difference but filling stations typically store their gas underground where the temperature variations during the day are not nearly what we have of course in the air above so it's not going to make any difference in a twenty four hour stretch and they went and they perform some experiments on this\nTo see in fact if it would make any difference and\nIt just really doesn't so best thing to do is if the weather's nice outside you can go ahead and get gas and it's not going to be any less dense and make any difference rather than
