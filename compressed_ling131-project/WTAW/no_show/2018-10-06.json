I'm Sorry two touchdowns and that makes you poor thing the comforts of quarterback\nYou on the opposite side you have came to put Dora who went out last week he had had a virus that was the talk among every body and I think probably just got plum worn out as they say and been a I had to leave the ballgame gauge Paul came in in a very uh uh tenuous time and the ball game\nAnd then put Dora though his stats forty eight of eighty nine for eight hundred three yards he's had three I N T seven touchdown thunder season he was supposed to be back as a starter tonight but last week mark green as you as you will hear leap adored talk about they have a lot of repair to do on that front off into line for being consolidated\nTiger yes they do they ah you know have some low snaps last week in and they were playing\nA deep into an office if you will I mean were they were starting three were yours in the backfield because each it's aligned was making such a Bush on the off the hook line Huntsville defensive line is just so large and we're pushing that the office of land back three or four yards and it happened to pick up the low snap the consolidated audience just couldn't get anything

I can laugh the\nPeace and think it's going to be pouring rain making a point you want\nHello again everyone and welcome to a and M. consolidated tiger football you're tigers are on the road in Montgomery tonight but first we're going to hit rewind to something we really don't want to talk much about that is Huntsville and the loss of twenty seven seven\nWhich does seem lopsided and frankly for what we were all expecting it is but Liam will tell you the reason we start by talking about the loss that's where you learn about your team that's where you start to see the character ab team come up it's not about what happened in Huntsville it's what you learn from it and how you bounce back\nThat's what I talked to the kids about of course you get disappointed with laws but you know we we talk to him about coming up on Saturday watching film\nAnd seeing the things we need to fix and when that film was overthrown away you're done with it and move on and keep your heads up and I think our guys did a good job this week studying that film putting in behind us and getting ready for our next opponent\nYou know things are going to hit a gym we tell them all the time it versus the strikes you got to deal with it and move on I thought you know the first half we did a pretty good game we knew was gonna be a tough game it was seven seven and half but we still had opportunities with getting to turnovers from a defense should put points on the board and\nWe gave up a couple of big plays on defense um you know they kind of struck us but\nI thought our kids thought the whole way through the game even when we're behind you know going hard but you know those games are within his down and move on and getting ready for the next one\nLady I think you mentioned something earlier regarding the expectation of a team when you do get a setback you've had this happen to you before\nI think for fans are they're coming in with high expectation I've always said I liked the state ranking either belong there you don't it's up to other people to prove you don't you don't belong there so those never bothered me I like the fact these fans expect a lot from the tigers and you expect a lot in their team but this kind of set back right here you've been through before\nYeah you know do the kids I've had teams before we had lost and it was disappointing but I tell them you keep your heads up put it behind you\nSome of those teams let it get in their head and we turned out to be an average team that year we had some teams that after that loss I said we're not going to let this effect just Bush and they win four rounds deep in the playoffs you know type deal\nA coach one other player that that seems to stand out I mean we know we had the two point conversion to him with Josh Alison which I thought was awesome last week I don't I don't know what the film looked like but it was almost something superhuman that does not calculate the how that guy's built\nRunning down the quarterback there was a plague behind a line of scrimmage he's the one that chases in town and tackle seem there's that's not supposed to be possible\nWith what I told the kids when we're watching film I'm Glad you brought that up because there was one time they went a wide stretch and I said guys that's our defensive tackle flying out there and making a play Josh didn't give up I mean he looked like a dang secondary guy flying out there to make the attack on\nAnd if you go by and watch replay he'd tackle clean he land and that's two hundred and eighty pounds falling on top of that big ... you know a quarterback so that's the type of thing we've got a half from our defense of front\nFlying around all the time 'cause like I tell them you never know when the guy's going to spin out and try to come back and that's when you get a chance to pop but Josh did a good job flying with the ball\nWe talked about often simply from the gum right now let's go to their defense and wrapping up here to tell me what it is that they do that might cause you a bit of concern and where is their main strength on defense\nTheir own blitz like crazy you know that's one thing they're going to get a lot of odd front so good and you know the three three stack but they do a lot of Tim and Tom and blitz is off the edge\nWhen they do do the blitz I Do some man coverage and things like that so we had a week of it with Huntsville be prepared and how we got another week of it to be prepared and I'll be honest with you know I think a lot of teams are going to be bringing blitz is honest because they've seen that's artist little bit but I think our guys are corrected and get it fixed and you know we talked about not\nLosing a distance when they're doing those blitz is not let him drives by we've got a town last scrimmage I think we've done a better job in that\nCoach thank you for spending time with us eight um consolidated tigers are on the road district play the ... and for the purposes did you ever play Montgomery back in the day well I'm you're talking about when I play a balance I can barely remember what it was yesterday so that type of deal but\nUm you know I just I Know they were always a big school and that type deal with our members when we use the scrimmage them all the time when I was an avid soda and\nIt was always a tough game because it was like getting prepared for everything because he's going to do every wrinkle ... but I'm I'm very impressed goes both thing we've always had a good relationship and and stay in touch with each other and stuff 'cause I've had coaches almost apt to work for him and\nAnd I had a coaches at you know came from his staff and went on to be head coaches and that so you say he puts good group together\nThe reason I was asking you in are the same not remember I can remember stuff from games back in the nineties but I Can't remember three days ago I think this is the first game consolidated ever played against Montgomery that isn't at least in in my history lay thank you very much a look at our starting lineups and the kickoff are coming your way next and said M consolidated and Montgomery just

Rudy is barbecue and by subway welcome back to Montgomery I asked the stadium work\nTonight the eight I'm consolidated tigers will take on the bears the gum ray you're hurt coat sleep a door and I don't blame a team mark after what we saw last week you had low snaps which caused gauge Paul and to a degree caved in to really have to struggle by the time they look up you've got a pretty good analogy and describing that it's just tough to execute to play with that kind of a pressure\nThat absolutely is you know the the snapped furlough the quarterback has to reach down looking down to try to find the ball when he looks up his op inches line is pushing up against his pocket\nAnd all he could do was step out of the pocket try to make plays about that time you're already three or four seconds you need to be releasing the ball with it a second or two and you're just not able to look down fielding check off all your receiver\nAnd as you heard lead talk about the Montgomery Bears do plan to blitz tonight they do that already and that's what his at least a kept them somewhat in games but the defense Fort McHenry seems to be the area that coach John Bolton 'cause most worried about and certainly with his results\nOr why not they've given up three games with forty six forty to forty four points and then of course\nThey give up twenty two against writer but when you look across the front of the defensive line Wesley made a senior in cable shattered the senior that's on the fence it banned uh made the nose guard those the two that could do the most damage against the tigers tonight\nOn the return of ... a ... on certain cadences Dora you also have the weapon that is Steven re in the background\nAnd the ... field and I will say that last week the receiving poor as we mentioned fully covered a rather well but a lot of that had to do with the blitz the deep active Stevie Ray gets loose tonight and opens the door just a little bit I think the government bears could be in for a long night\nYeah the ah consult tigers have for receivers in the top ten in the district Ron ... leads to consult receivers number two two hundred and eleven York receiving three touchdowns that ballot Jones number three in the district\nWith a hundred and Seventy yard receiving Devin process number seven in the district with two hundred and fifty yards and poor touchdowns in Stevie Ray hundred eighty eight yours to touch the [noise]\nOther some other games that are going on across Syria tonight will be following several of those throughout the evening here on W W and there's a ball game\nTomorrow it six just the opposite of Texas a and M. taking on Kentucky and that's a rather rangers there on the road tomorrow at low bar consolidated that's going to be a really tough field to climb a for a coach Greg Morgan and his crew I was a runner rangers bark if you have a list there just a few other games that are going to be going on there will be following this evening\nYeah do I added district but a local interest the Brian ... bears and the Brits went bears or the team that coach David ... left consolidated witness started that program or the uh [noise]\nUh bring them cubs her point of view patriots the College Station cougars were playing Waller Cleveland in Huntsville in a district or a division two in the in our district in as you mentioned ... Lamar consolidated tomorrow night it's six PM never show does\nPlay into north force highschool bulldogs in lake creek is playing ... pay towel over legacy stadium it's six o'clock to not I do not have a scoring up\nThe I'm Sorry that's tomorrow night yeah and as we look ahead one week it will be I\nAm consolidated hosting lumbar consolidated his they'll come rolling into College Station next week and next with these Montgomery Bears there'll be traveling to take on\nA coach southern and the Huntsville hornets and they're in for quite a surprise but the hornet's as they did a number on the tigers last week final up twenty seven to seven John both thing and it's fourteenth year the head coach them a gum relief door up or you're a in a consolidated tigers he's in his second year\nA record of twelve and four and a coaching record overall up one hundred Seventy nine wins fifty eight losses and one time\nAnd he said fifty yeah we did ... there was a debate on that yesterday's that'll writers nine I think that you know I couldn't read my writing but it is fifty nine lawsuits and least says he doesn't remember the wins but he remembers all of the losses\nAt this point let me get a one minute break we'll be back with a look at the starting lineup and the toss the coin in tonight's ballgame and you're listening to eight I'm consolidated tiger football Mm\nI'm Ryan how are you is the same college district I Wish all of our area isn't now that I met him in the short committed to make a dent in the back and they are on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are in line at the heart gain of maybe two I got to give him the twenty six as forward progress that'll bring up a second down to Fifteen\n[noise] see I've got to think Jay would Washington saying coach don't call that way anymore 'cause he ran into the worst of all that is just yell will send a judge just grab the picked him up slammed him through the\nCarpet down the front of the line that's will Harris from left or right will it left in defensive tackle Josh Allison the defensive tackle the his writings counter Hicks and Vince Sheffield who's the writer and will finish in a moment\nOn third down empty backfield for both thing on third and fifth team goes out of the gun back into the pocket protector pressure coming and he just lost sit up straight\nUp in the fall fall didn't complain I don't think that now they're going to call the flag that is going to be cast interference that's called against jailed Washington\n[noise] that might have been one of the worst passed since I've seen in the history of high school football close no\nNo slam on bowl thing but it's because of the fierce rush that was put on by the eight I'm consolidated tigers and so apparently that's going to be a spot fell which means it will be a first down ten no they're going to say it's a a Fifteen [laughter] it'll be out there we're getting ready to be able to play on ready to line up and yeah the official\nThey thought they were playing NFL out here I guess it's a Fifteen your ... in high school and that to pass interference call was on the McHale Washington and or a tale Williams oh he did was he was looking back at all and when he turned around just ran into the receiver oh the one that like you said it was a lame duck\nPass the live back in Korea's mckell William tonight daily and gun or coke or the quarterback through save your Stewart to the right Nate forward to the left safety surgery Markey Stewart and Bryce Linder\n[noise] it'll bring up a first\nDown ten from a gum reacted the penalty it'll be as a forty one yard line for hash mark wide side is to the left single set back now a man in motion is both thing they do a jet sweet coming near side trying to find a whole bunch sit outside no nothing doing there\nAs he's run out of bounds on the near side line nice defensive play by nature boy do contain them the ball carrier that time was Caleb Schneider and with that it'll bring up a second down and ten no gain on the\nPlay officially I look like the perfect pitch to play the jets sweeping the the defense did and overcome it just kept string it out to the sideline and he had nowhere to turn to a bowl of soup\nAnd honestly there's really not much yard it's just been gained on their own tonight the big Fifteen yard penalty has been a plus ... out of the gun play action throws over the middle ball let's call it that was a perfect pulled it off of each arm of brought Cole thing and the pastors complete that is going to go to the wide receiver coal more it's a little slant route nothing ... nothing\nReally painful about that [noise] just right across the middle actually let's call it the tide in that is cold\nWar and so that's where he lines up and with a little plant that are nothing a ornate just pulls it in for the first down\nNo just a little slant Thirteen your pick a\nPope and brings them up first down calls for the staff has it play action throws near cite another completed task this one night Floyd is all over in the receivers made some little as he pulls it in for a gain of about ... or six yards illness lay it'll bring up a second down for\nThis looks like the ... be able to do great defense or they're given the receivers in the body in the in the back for that matter a little bit of pushing room don't mind given up a little bit of a yard itch but they are going to contain a try to keep her get her to\nSeven fifty three clock is running first quarter a second down and for needed for the first\nLine of scrimmage was that the tiger forty\nAnd stood up right at the line of scrimmage and drill for no gain on the plane [noise] and what to stop it was by Josh Ellison the ones that come in and I will tell you you the one commits play to the level that Josh Ellison has shown in his maturity from his junior and senior year tour and Bradley\nJust met him face to face and was thrilled and Josh\nJosh was not going to let go that was\nPretty impressive that'd be just she's doing the Nazis introducing himself to his\nNew ... yes exactly raise up a third down for now both thing goes out of the gun and has the trailing ... man to the left\n[noise]\nPlay action rolling till the ride bowl thing with time pressure coming out with a metal dollars ten dollars an hour ago the tigers were the return it before the yard line has a block at the forty five and ... down and that's got to be a horse color and it is what the policy picked off by none other than Bryce lender and a huge return and probably Fifteen yards tacked onto it\nIt brings up a fourth it along there was a holding all against the ... say like that\n[noise] so that will move it back ten yards [noise]\nAnd that moves it back to the twenty four yard line so it would be a forty one yard field goal attempt but they're going to go forward here on force and law they need about twelve for the first goal is just inside the twenty five they need to get down to the Thirteen but gum ready for the first\nTo White House led to to the right one single set back out of the gun core step drop\nOver the metal ball is taught wide open ended up five yard line still trying to go forward states to tackle or is it finally goes down without first goal to go to yard line I've talked to catch it and run by Brian Darby boy the tigers\nReally made them pay on that fourth in law and you could see the play unfolding ...\nBoy the tigers really made them pay on that fourth in law and you could see the play unfolding Darby right down the middle open pulls it but the real show happened after he had Brett being on his back and just continues to go forward with the football and we do have an injured player on the field for the Buckeye MRI bears but he is now up and walking off on his own accord\nYeah what a great deal kitchen run by Brian Darby and the extra effort picked up another four or five yards got a personal fell face mask on ... [noise]\nAll right so they're not going to attack it on there I mean it is going to be a penalty that will be the climate so certainly do they tack it all and they they do ... half the distance to to go I see it your eyes he was down at the six\nGot moved the ball down to about the woman and a half yard line yeah actually I think is down around the three something like that that's where it so that makes perfect sense half the distance to the go\n\nMan in motion across the backfield for Dora with a pitch back into the end zone untouched well until he got into the end zone that's the cuts down on the back of that goes to Bryan Darby as they let him complete the job that he started\nI think that was because of the effort that he may so with that it will bring up a twelve to nothing ball game a minute eleven remaining in those first quarter a play\nAt a time out has been called by a and M. consolidated thinking about going for two will take a thirty second time out as well as a momentary breaking the actual is cause for this you're listening to a and M. consolidated tiger football\nYou work hard for your money so why should you pay expensive these days at a un credit union we offer truly free checking because we think you should keep your money and with a credit union you're not just the customer you're a member\nAlong with free checking other advantages include great rates on loans and the privates and he land credit union where your credit union and it will be with you every step of the way does it as an ... or somewhere details membership required federally insured by in the U.

that was that was picture perfect coverage on price could not pull it down the defender was Quincy Paulson\nGood night I Will tell you that textbook coverage right there and that's how you shut down

right one wide receiver to the near side empty bacterial swing past goes out now too Darby Darby with a little bit of running room has five has seven yards and that's going to be about all she wrote a scrum and\nIt's going to be called down I think at a round the thirty two yard line which would make it a six yard pick up on the play\nAnd bring up a second down for before he's gang tackled far side

warrior got knocked down hard but he is up so it will be one snapping done here in the first half of play\nGood night want to take away by Montgomery as the tigers had a really nice Dr going and they

[noise]\nDon't they're going to give it all\nAcross the thirty five yard line to the forty and then shot down final play of the first half the ball carrier is Taryn Bradley and that is going to be the end of the first half as the eight of consolidated tigers leading at twenty five six Well Mark green here we go this is where you kind of talk about being spoiled about your team\nIt is twenty five or six and I don't think anybody's too happy with what they're seeing out there the tigers well the a lot to work on here\nA lot to work on the consult tigers came out looking pretty good early moving the ball will scoring quickly but we've gotten into a situation where it's got sloppy and maybe taking some things for for granted\nIf you remember if you're an aggy theater member ah Arkansas last week they came out fourteen quick points you thought here we go and then you know the the ... basically shut down\nIts what's happening here there's just too many middle mistakes too many bad snaps too many bad throws a couple of bubbles bobble bowl bobble a a klutz so it just there's a lot of things that need to\nBe worked on the second half but I really don't think that uh the ... the special teams but the two point conversions have to be a little bit of a concern to leave the door and also you look at some of the other special team slaves we've seen a little bit of improvement but some break down as well\nAnd when you talk about the government bears your heart goes out to them I mean they really had no answer was the tigers have dial up of tiger ... really are a little bit in areas that I really didn't expect them to bend there was some coverage issue\nI mean that that's got to be an awful long time ago\nHad to be yeah oh man yeah yeah [noise]\nLooking forward to it you know I really bears to tell you but I I still have a buddy in Kentucky's a basketball school [laughter]\nWe'll see [laughter] I don't they're not just happened to be tuning right let's see if they got to be

[noise] two running backs to wipe out to the near side [noise] I'm\nSecond down and three ended up to the eye back again coming to the near side\nI Believe that as Quincy Paulson on the Kerry how they're going to give it to small again and so with that now brings up a third down about two yards needed for the first two minutes twenty five seconds remaining in the game [noise]\nMentioned the consolidated tigers after the ball game going forward in one and wanted one and district blame a governor you went up all the one in four\nAnd one in one district as well on third down about three in the late ... right up the middle of the right inside goes that the twenty yard line [noise] of trace Molly carrying the load therefore the\nGum re bears that does move the change for the first downtown I Believe at the Twenty one yard line [noise] pretty impressive drive in the ball game at least forty eight yard live it's where they started and then you can solve into the field\nLay give one more time coming to the near side small they get the call goes back to the line of scrimmage and that's\nAbout all\nStop on the plague they be as Copeland\n\nSeeing some different players into a ball game for the tigers yeah it was just going to mention I think we've got some ... other ballplayers and they're the bombs or grandma was out of here some names\n[noise] so it's a second down eleven actually a loss of one things to cope with these big hit [noise]\nFull house back we'll give the dope it's going to be a play action fast roaster the far side of this complete and then chop down in the far left\n[noise]\nSee I'd want to say that that might have been\nA tray harden tray hard with reception brings up a third down and now it's time out with a minute remaining and a timeout call by someone gum Rene bears will take it with I'm thirty nine six is our score\nConsolidated leads is back with more than a ball but you're listening to a un consolidated tiger football\nSome

play\nAction about both finger quarterback keeper and he just dies down at the Fifteen yard\nLine\nPick up a few yards on the plane but he'll be about three and a half maybe for shorter the first so now brings up a fourth down\nAnd they'll need about five for the first down maybe along five actually block continuing to run at thirty nine seconds are going to let this thing trickle on down I think that they will go forward here on the fourth down but not until they absolutely have to snap the football they're trying to get outta here\nFrankly are a lot of people I mean this has really drug along tonight\nPart part of the deal was honestly our time was not until close to seven forty yeah a ... and there were a number of factors they just got kind of a late start\nPouring down six play action bolting rolling out to pass has the ball is caught but it is way\nShort of the first down and so with that the tigers will take it over on down and say well Neal one time and that's going to be [noise]\n\nSo once again the a and M. consolidated tigers pull off the win tonight it's not pretty I Know the margin is thirty nine and six but I Will tell you for those of you that have been listening oh what's strange is that the tigers didn't convert on three here here's something about numbers I find very fascinating had the tigers just get\nThree extra points instead of having to go for it\nVery fascinating had the tigers just get three extra points instead of having to go for two Everytime had they hit their extra point they would score forty two I guess Montgomery just like fighter just like Barbara seal\nAnd the magnolia scoring forty six don't you find it odd I Do yeah I was writing those down I thought it was all your numbers guy yeah but that's not not to happen I mean we miss the extra points so it would go down as thirty nine to fix the final [noise]\nBut of all the games that the Montgomery Bears play this year that is the lowest score that they've been allowed at six points of the clock ticks down its cage door it takes to me that's all she wrote them consolidated whims at thirty nine to fix the final score we're back with a wrap up\nOn this one at

negative really can't really affect you but what happens is you get thrown out of balance\nAnd you go into the chaos and then all the stuff affects you so it's a matter of controlling your mind and uh get back so within the balance and then we as craters working on a positive things doing positive things can change your life in the world\nComing up right now we're going to have a real sharman an intuitive on the program several folks who of course ah has had experiences and wants to share experiences with the crystal skull tonight or without further ado rerun the program several of you there\nI Am good evening good evening and for having me on Thursday night\nIt's great to have you on your background is but you are a a viewer worker you worry yo where where would you say a white worker or\nA person who has had experience with the schools moves to utilize them a pre positivity tell us about your experiences with the schools\nBut I probably have to start with my first encounter um and that was back in two thousand and eight I was attending a conference in Scottsdale, Arizona and here was this crystal goals sitting at the\nHeight of the room with a long line of people that wanted to experience the energy or maybe have their photos taken with it and a friend came up to me and she said\nStephanie let's go over and get our\nPictures taken with the crystal skulls that I was like oh no thank you I'm really not that interested and then Bill Gates has presentation and his lecture on the skull and it was fascinating and I learned something about them than interestingly\nThere was the crystal skull again the Mitchell Hedges sitting at the site of the room with another long line of people waiting to have their little experience with it and my friend came up to me and said\nThe line has died down let's go over there to do this thing so I thought okay so I went over and my hands around it and maybe\nIt energy is palatable it is an amazing frequency that is emanating from the school and I thought cool full stop the end goal disappeared for the rest of the lecture and it was well into the evening\nAnd Claire audience lady I heard you get up you were to be\nWith the crystal skull and I thought to myself you know I'm really not that interested I Want to hear the rest of this lecture on crop circles\nAnd then I heard get up to now\nSo I pay attention when I have intuitive messages like that I left the conference hall I started walking around with great hotel in Scottsdale and I'm thinking to myself\nThis is ludicrous I really am I going to find this crystal skull behind some deep hotel door and I'm sure enough that's exactly what happened and a door open and I saw bill and I put my head in the door way and you have to\nCome in we're waiting for you and I said I got this crazy message I'm supposed to be with the Chris and I couldn't even get the words out and build said\nSitting out I Know how it works and that was the beginning of a very interesting an extraordinary journey for me it's colored my life with these experiences that have taken me to um places like couponing um in\nGuatemala it introduced me to people like scientists explorers and that's the gate of Nepal adjust and medicine people\nOf the highest caliber and I've witnessed the paranormal true the crystal skulls firsthand time and time again I'm I've witnessed instantaneous feelings and\nI personally have access doorways into portals of awareness or I'm Amazed and delighted with my work which in cages these\nVery high vibration all crystalline being\nWhen you're talking about portrayals of new awareness are you talking about a dimensional a possible dimensional travel or at least a pretty reminding two dimensional rooms\nThat part of it yeah [laughter] um\nSo are you are you a are you indicating guy a beard beyond what we have in the physical there are many dimensions said so many scientists are now realize that we are\nAre in some overlapping or there's overlapping dimensions but we certainly are can have one foot in ... in one one with the other would you say that's true\nAbsolutely\nTrue yes can any other thing\nWith the crystal skulls I'm I offer group meditations with the schools because I feel\nThat having personal experiences with them are really our best way for communicating what they're all about sharing our firsthand experiences and they didn't come with a key or a non button [laughter] it's really true those\nPersonal experiences that we are expanding our awareness and our conscious so in one of my circles um there was a woman who later came up to me um about a month later actually\nAnd she said Stephanie in your circle I was brought there by a friend for the medication and I wasn't into crystal skulls I had cut my leg and I knew I was going to have to stitches and that was trying to nurse it along so I wouldn't have to go to the emergency and\nYou know spend the money to have that taking care of but it hadn't stop bleeding for about\nThree days and I she said after your meditation I was going to go to the urgent care and get a stretch\nAnd she said because I really wasn't in to the whole thing I was sitting there with my eyes open and from the circle a beam of light shot from\nName crystal skull and the center of the circle and my leg was killed and and she showed me a scar on her leg where it was and she said she did it stop bleeding she didn't need stitches and it was like and then to Haiti us\nAnd didn't have any of healing [laughter] that's one little story\nWell it's amazing that uh you know you were able to leave the beam of light that came out\nYou know I don't know if you've been hearing about whether you're fired whether you're found in a an article\nNow is it there would be the beam an energy beam of matter that they have no account for but it's coming from space through the climate out through in order\nSo you know they're used in once again the whole idea behind bring

extracted or at least discovered by using the skulls these powers these technological signatures they call them up of ancient technology from ancient civilizations the skull in my opinion is ancient technology\nAbsolutely they are taking care of with the knowledge and their hype racial tools to work with\nLike a and I do believe that they expanded our culture clash we're learning all the time I ... and he said there are a joy right around ... crystal skull\nAnd don't you know when channeling a lot of people are generally should go down and channel and started being\nWell and that's exactly what's supposed to happen I get a as I said before\nThey're becoming a scientist or becoming more aggressive they're into a finding of a conscious is is they're they're looking to Penn psych gives them\nA quantum mortality we just going down the list in and using mathematics and trying to join together the mathematics the ... the Tego signatures and everything that we once said was supernatural paranormal it is now becoming the normal and uh I find that very important as we move a\nThroughout the twenty first century and then through the new millennium all these wonderful experiences that

eighty I was telling Nick before we went on the air I had there to speak to the Henderson caddy master gardeners association fall banquet\nA couple of days ago and had a wonderful time in Athens and

and uh so I I miss having that opportunity to to\nSpeak directly there but oh my goodness gracious it is so nice to have a have a chance to see people in person and and visit with them and and we had about two hundred and Seventy five people there I think so that worked at a really really well\nUm I don't give a lot of talks are right now and uh uh it's just kind of hard to get away from home and\nAnd uh so that was a good opportunity I see calls coming in so we know that the phones are working that's good we have some new equipment and it was a little bit more challenging last week\nLet me give you the phone number one more time and they were going to take a break and get right to those calls my goal is not to keep you on hold very long and to take as many calls is weak candidate\nNot a race or style but to puncture functionally\nUh eight eight eight to five six ten eighty for the Texas lawn and garden our eight eight eight to five six ten eighty as we head on into October it to a good time\nIts own top it'll be the top surfaces the second insect that I Would want to know about is quite Myrtle scale this is a relatively new insect it first appeared in Richardson in two thousand for the first time it was ever observed in the United states we didn't know what it was was taken into a retail nursery and Richardson\nA for identification is spread not only through the metroplex but eventually it took about six or seven years to get around in Texas but then it started going east and it's clear to the east coast now criminal scale looks like a little\nPieces little chunks remnants of popcorn stuck to the trunk\nOr each of these insects gives off a sticky honeydew residue a aphids are are going to give a lot more of it and they are more widespread across Texas or they will coats the leaves like I said and and give that sticky surface\nWhat you're seeing is called city mold as so TY sue the mold is harmless to the plant is ugly it is somewhat disfiguring but it is harmless\nEverybody gets all up in arms about city mold and in reality we need to worry about whatever was there before that allowed the city mold to grow it has to have a substrate of honeydew\nBefore it will develop a that's why you're seeing it on the pit is for him because that that sap might guarantee is that that that is for him as either directly beneath are almost directly beneath the great Myrtle is that correct\nCorrect All right if you had parked in old carbon each one of these towler great models that old car would have sued him old on it if you had patio furniture if you had my pay stone driveway yeah you'd have city that I get I get sued the mold\nA on some of our things because of pecan aphids on our pecan trees anytime you have a food you're going to get to do and and that's where the city will comes from to get rid of the city mold you get rid of the the aphids or whatever insects is causing the honeydew\nBeforehand before they reforms I Can't justify spray twenty or thirty big ... trees so I just uh I clean the pay stone after about a month it it goes away and\nAnd and it will go away from your great marvels when the leaves fall it'll it'll be gone off the leaves if any of its own the bark of the trunks it'll go away when the bark ex fully aids if a if you want to put a\nA a a good hard spray you so be warm water onto the his forums it'll washed their leaves off\nA it's a little harder on his foreign because ah of the fact that they're evergreen but when the new leaves come out in the spring they will be clean I just don't let the insects develop next year and you'll you'll keep the city mold away\nThat's all I don't know how it can get stuck\nIm older white oh that's all I don't know how I Would try and get rid of events that are now\nYou say well you don't get rid of them now you have to do it when they began before the problem shows up the I I I have written that very late the story on this for my ... gardens that came out two nights ago and it's also on the quake Myrtle trails\nOf website criminal trials that Oregon or pest control you use a systemic insecticide called him ... produces the most common insecticide in the world\nThe timing for it very specifically is the middle of may\nAnd the reason for that is you want to put it on before the plants are in bloom and ah so anyway I gave you a lot at one one lesson here this is like taking a whole semester course in one day and but that's the answer\nAt if I were to transplant a heightened Merrill that's about four four and a half feet tall and how much do I need to get and do I need to wait for November December January\nTo wait until it's bear it would be better I mean there are more forgiving and most plants but generally with woody plants you have to wait until the middle of the winter when they're dormant uh as far as how much of the root system do you need a it's all dependent on the Trump diameter not so much on the height of the plant\nAnd a four O. one inch diameter uh I Would try to get 'em and that's cumulative if you have several Steve's yet I'm together I Would try to get a syllable this probably fourteen or Fifteen inches across\nA not out not in radius but in diameter or if uh the trunk is bigger than that and it would go up proportionally but okay for probably Fifteen or sixteen each or something like that\nThey appreciate your call I Hope that help Jones you bet have a good one I'd Sue Ellen and Brian and Julia ... county time breathless county time it's a huge T.

Kelly very very much and uh\nWe go back to our phone lines lines are all field right now we go to Billy jak in Elkhart Billy jak this Neal good morning\nI get on an ... uh I uh crochet your program a thank you wanted to get your uh your version of getting rid of a Alice grass at a as intermingled with Rothstein August day\nAll right it is an annoying and that is that and that's the age of the two for which we don't really have much control other than just going after it a pretty aggressively assertively it's it's going to disrupt the look of your St Augustine I I Will tell you that up front\nA there are two ways and I'm not proud of either answer but there is no weed killers you can use that will kill it without killing the St Augustine so like I say we're gonna have to disrupt things a little bit [noise]\nFirst of all a every see the Dallas grass producers is for all they do not require pollination and so it's very critical\nThat you are most frequently so that you keep the seat is from forming and they seem to form overnight after you most you're going to be ... pretty often I realize that but but that's a good starting point to help any new plants from starting\nA there are two ways one is to is to dig it out as you see the clumps starting to form\nA and it looks so much like St Augustine sometimes it's kinda hard to find it but that's one way you get a sharp shooter spade and and just dig it out and a lot of times you can do that at an angle enough that that you don't really make a big nasty looking spot in lawn\nA gentleman had a suggestion like very much ah that that works pretty well and that's a if you if you want to use the spray egg life a seat weed killer just the original round up or clean up\nThat has no other active ingredient other than the life of said would be the one to use yes it will brown or killed the St Augustine is going to kill the St Augustine\nBut it will cover back from the sides um\nThe way to minimize any extra spray damage is to take a one gallon milk jug and if he is small clumps of of ... maybe even a court milk dug\nUm if there is a half gallon maybe that'd be great to and take the bottom out of it cut it out with a knife in and take the lid off push that down over the clump and stick a spray one down into the into the bottle and and that will contain the spray right there\nAnd that works really well I've seen a used in it works really well\nBut the critical thing is just keep after it and be persistent or maybe you have assigned painted this is a herbicides hysteria be patient or say for the neighbors but it's a that's a horrible we'd of I've spent more than my shirt time doing exactly what you're about to start doing\nWell by the sun so I'm kind of farm or I'd be glad to have to just so anyway\nIt's it's just it's perennials so pre emergence don't really help much it did just that and and it is the one one of those to those are the only two weeds that are more\nA dominant than St Augustine is see notice you know a crowd of everything else out but not those two I Hope it helps\nYes are very very good appreciate every work as pope\nThank you Billy jak have a good day daycare let's go to Dave in great planned I Know right or a great plan this because my cousin and her husband live there Davis Neal how can I help you\nThe plan this because my cousins and her husband lived there Davis Neal how

kind of trees are they\nOld or a wealthy oh\nNo I ... it wouldn't have mattered what you just said I Will tell you though with oak you'd you'd need to avoid pruning and the spring\nBut a pretty right now is not a problem that the only time you don't want to prove oaks\nWould be from Valentine's Day too about the middle of July\nAnd the reason for that is wilt um that's especially critical in the hill country and other areas where a quilt has a problem but in your area it may not be much of a problem I Would seal the cuts if you can get to them I Would seal them with burning paint on the folks on other trees it doesn't matter no you're fine\nAnd you thought about the last ... or whatever it is bad yeah and and the letter it's unclear oh\nYou know what's annoying and and K.

got through watching a tremendous rally by Oklahoma and a victory by Texas one of those games where you're kind of torn you got some former players playing on the on the uh sooner side that maybe you do or do not root for and then well on orange\nYou know there's about I've cheered for Texas three times in my life\nOnce against Kentucky basketball there would've been a three way championship\nTexas did not win that game Kentucky wanted a name and in Texas tied for second\nIn Nineteen eighty five\nOr Texas had to be Baylor\nAnd that made the game against Texas A M M on Thanksgiving night Nineteen Ninety five for the championship\nSo that's twice third time\nI only want to remember so I'm not I've forgotten so I can only remember two of the three times that I ever rooted for Texas in my life I'm unwritten against anybody today or let's put it that way um\nBut that was like what was it ended up forty eight forty five field goal with fourteen seconds left\nIn the game that led to the a victory for the longhorns today or as poor a defense is I have ever seen on the field for the Oklahoma centers or it it was I'm next to nothing there\nAnd I thought that I saw bad the pets from Baylor last week against a Oklahoma that was just the appetizer to give me ready for this today other top twenty five bowl games that are going on as we speak Michigan leads Maryland is thirty five fourteen means Marilyn will not get another victory this year\nI'm Clemson they lead Wake Forest seven to nothing five minutes to play out five minutes left in the first quarter LSU in Florida\nI thought that might have been another three to two game they they kinda looked at that today on the SEC a pre game show\nFlorida State leads Miami seven to nothing\nSilence is deafening after an early safety gave Iowa State of two to nothing lead the teams have answered with touchdowns each candidate nine seven Iowa State over Oklahoma State\nGave me that final of the longhorns

Gabriel the sideline reporter longtime sideline reporter for Kentucky football is going to be joining us in about ten minutes a\n[noise] but like victory streak\nTexas for dealers are proud to say forward as America's Best selling brand quality safety technology and fuel efficiency help help Ford or in this level of customer loyalty it just one more reason why Ford is the best in Texas\nAre getting you are ready for Texas a and M. versus Kentucky oh let's see if we're going to go out to the phone lines is\nStill waiting or we ... we can just hang out for a little while you know we're going to have ... joined\nUs on the phone line he was a uh up in the press box there and are are getting ready for the Kentucky broadcast Caesar sideline reporter longtime sideline reporter on just a let us know if you've got him on the are\nStill hurting to get him can we talk about it being October it's still pretty warm outside\nYou know I'm I'm fine I haven't\nBeen doing it I think that's the most exercise I've gotten it got to be in a long time long time\nBusy street saw do what what did I park I had to park all the way a over by the new liberal arts building that's where we have our our new parking passes yeah yeah a problem with that you know\nOh it's not bad unless you're unless you're crunching time oh ah well nobody asked you Andrew\nHe just voluntarily just say well you know that's\nWhere I don't have a problem right next to Andrew who wasn't any problem selling your man okay let's see if\nWe have him on the phone line degree there I Am here\nUh he has not brought it up I can hear him through the uh through the ah\nIt was it was a faint whisper I've heard of a whisper of it\nSo I think we were just hearing you hear me now I can hear you now there\nYou're you're one of my time an ambulance\nWhile you we talked to on the week I was on your show up there in Kentucky and uh you talked about being here in the early eighties\nComing down to call the old stadium change a little bit adding it\nWell it really adds it's bigger and grander and I was not down here for a game but I got to look around back then but it it is much nicer now to incredible\nUh I think that uh how much has Kentucky caught the fancy of the uh the athletic supporters there and Kentucky this football team I Know that it's such a basketball centered stay but when you're talking about being rang a chance to be six you know for the first time since ... Brian was your coach\nI Would think that Kentucky football is converting a Kentucky fans\nWell actually there or they've been around since Brian this is the best dark [noise]\nYes I understand are down there\nI Am but this is the best start\nBack on the on the\nBack of your industry conference are they they don't have to pour into and even five and a storage but it's been forever ... six you know but to be perfectly honest with you\nThis Kentucky a big blue nation was kind of a hard sell going into this season yeah last year they won seven or they want you on a second straight ball game but they had lost both her bowl games when they're stupid and and to tell you the truth last year they really under a cheap\nThey left to win on the field intellectually and then the new shuttle one that ball game as well so Kentucky fans really think this team should almost eight nine ten games last year and\nNot knowing who the quarterback was going into this season\nThey were really skeptical season ticket sales were down in the summertime and people just weren't all that excited they say that you know they're either went six or seven games will go back to the city will get eat again big deal so they're starting to get a little spoiled well when they\nBeat Florida sky when they staff that streak that all changed\nThen here comes Mississippi State two weeks later a team that a lot of people have talked to challenge Alabama and they absolutely beat them down so little\nNow the last two or three weeks\nThan just throwing their arms open and quite frankly I think they're not happy that they're an underdog even though their ... their teeth of an Amazon rank but I think they realize that they're going in was played an incredibly tough schedule their own you're on the road at a really tough place to win\nSo I I think they're just looking for a good representation today it'd be perfectly honest\nDick and this is Anna Taylor and as you talk about there's a lot of people that are rallying behind this team and Kentucky getting a lot of national pub or at least on the Southeastern Conference side of things but also a dynamic player and then he ... he talks a lot but he's got the game to back it up\nHe really does in what's funny about it is he he talks he speaks about himself every now and then in the third person a lot of people like that but he backs it up but the other thing is he's just really like I'm always very humble even though he talks he's constantly\nLavish praise on his offensive lineman on the defense on Josh island on his coaches and it's genuine if you spent five minutes to go it's genuine and you know he's constantly says he was living in his dream\nAnd he he actions though he doesn't that nobody knows anything you know show it just it just felt like the guy very charismatic\nBut then he goes out and back up and what's interesting is when stokes first he tried a little bit of that air raid kind of off that really\nDidn't suit him as a head coach he likes to play Jim ... kind of football you know ground in town and then turn it over your ... well now he's got a ride running back where he can do that and he's got a backup back and Jay Roach it that\nUh but he also has the events that can back it up so you know Kentucky fans for a while they're they're like just entertainers just throw the ball will be happy but now they love watching any run\nYou talked about that that they got away from that so wide open all sense and uh it it sounds to me you're talking about Jim truffle it sounds to me\nThat what he saw at Florida State when he was a defensive coordinator pretend both Fisher that that's kind of we're going to see a mirror image as well because he saw the success Fisher had at Florida State running that all Simpson that was where uh where students was before he left for Kentucky\nThere's no question you know they're all about the position and and you know time of possession and quite frankly the first three or four years and he was a Kentucky he did not have the death on the fence\nTo keep sending his defense back out you know even if they had a they they did a danger really equipped strike often but the deep end was still sucking air on the sidelines and suddenly they had to go back out\nAnd try to hold the other guys down so you know it it just it just doesn't quite fit a Shannon Dawson who was down here for a while it's even a faucet and now\nA southern miss doing really good thing he spent a year at Kentucky but but you know he's a kind of got to throw it on every down as he put it like how money\nBut it just wasn't a good fit\nOr march to actually goes and gets ready granted daring Hinshaw who were Cincinnati and granted that NBC veteran and they've got to play book that includes a lot of wide open stuff like when they're starting quarterback three years ago went down and she was a guy who throw the ball credibly well\nThey had to adjust right now and they went to the running attack and it's worked for him ever since\nYou know it's funny that you mentioned the time of his ... year these two officers are and how when they are the two coaches are\n... Kentucky actually rent one and two in time of position in the S. E. C. N. N. thirty five ... minutes five fifty two seconds the game in Kentucky second at thirty two minutes in ten seconds that being said you know a lot made about the ... been ... doing\nBut as you mentioned that defense has gotten better because of it and uh the Wildcats post in a really solid events this year\nYeah it's gotten I talked about this on my show is acting quite frankly uh I think what has happened is they've got so much tougher on the Milan interior line everybody knows about Josh ... last year Josh at six and a half sex but he had one and a half stack\nAnd the second half of the seeds and he just really fell off the typically there are other starting outside guy transfer and so now what are you going to do well they had spent the last four years\nWith the kid knows guard who was highly\nTouted hotly recruited turned down in Alabama to come to Kentucky\nBut it just didn't work out and he lost his starting job by the mid white point of his senior year to a tour freshman named Hannah and you'll see him today he's backed up by another red shirt freshman named to mirror do both both played\nReally well this year they've had they've done a great job against the run it collapsed the pocket all they've done is made Josh Allen a lot better because you've got a whole lot Joshua and I went and got on the inside and then on the other hand a kidney bookie Watson that's not a great name I don't know what is\nA is no good things as well so you know it's all kind of fallen into place\nThey lost their senior middle linebacker but replaced him with a really good athletes cash Daniel or the other line backer on the inside Jordan Jones was first team all conferences a sophomore spent most of last year injured he's back a hundred percent\nAnd the back for our juniors and seniors and including the first team all conference safety Mike Edward show a yeah it's all kind of come together form doesn't mean they're going to light up today but they got a pretty good chance\nYou know they gave her a sideline reporter for Kentucky a radio broadcast joining us here today\nA dig take us through winning that game against Florida Thirty years ah you know it last year I didn't think I'd seen every way that a team could lose a football game\n... dot edu slashed football on Twitter at get to the game [noise]\n\nWere outside tile field it's great to be here a cow after\nA weekend in Tuscaloosa and in Arlington, Texas with Dave Elmendorf I'm Andrew Monaco thank you so much for staying with us our your partner oh I'm terrific wait for this one this is a fun one you know it's funny we we focus so much they did we on that first month of the season for the Aggies\nEvent Kentucky says oh you know what the second month kicks off with a pretty good contest also\nIt's absolutely are a great game or playing number Thirteen and five and oh Kentucky at Garfield\nIt's such an intriguing game to me there are so many similarities both teams want to run the ball both teams have very good run defenses both head coaches are rebuilding and their teams are getting better and since we have the opportunity let's listen to what players and\nCoaches have to say and we're going to start that uh with what outstanding defensive lineman Kingsley Kiki has to say about Kentucky\nYeah there are a good team you know they came out and or the ... to see you know a hundred and ... not knowing you know [laughter] things into the world but they've done a good job and and the the they were in the ball in the world is when they start to stop 'em\nIn the Arkansas game the Aggies lost their leading receiver jamon off by packed with on yesterday practice the ... and a boot or to a foot injury it's unclear how long he'll be sidelined\nHere here's a replacement will be headed guy Jones and so here's what quarterback Kelvin mind had to say about Jones getting his chance\nI mean I've always been confident ... and uh even though he was being men behind to monitor the past two years and definitely come out to practice work hard every single day and no matter when he gets a chance to feel like he's going to San so came up with some big catches for us this weekend to move the chain so\nDefinitely looking forward to him increasing as well this week out\nThere may to me that's a great guy\nAnd to me it's always interesting to hear what team mates have to say about their co workers on the other side of the ball so when I saw this clip of killing mind talking about the Aggie defense I couldn't resist here's what Cal and had to say\nI Would say just a knowledge of the game I'm definitely in the defense of fun is doing a really good job of the season doing um has definitely improved in my opinion and having just somebody bouquet haul them tiki\nDefinitely guys who are guys who are really hard and then ... guys who is constantly worked hard and really improve both of their games together so [noise]\nUm the guys up front and everybody is kind of a whole group effort so that's pretty much the reasoning\nYou know they constantly working hard in this paying off I knew\nAnd finally this segment wouldn't be complete without something about our code jumbo finisher a he's a quarterback guru any work closely with his starter Kelvin mine and kill and talks about his mentors coaching style\nI knew coming into it that he was going to go to a super hard and that's something that I've heard from other players from other schools and\nUh we know that he loves us what you know that's why coaches us the way he does and we kind of look back at it and see it got us to this point so there's no reason to change and he's going to constantly be hard on this matter will play or it it is so something that we both do within but something that we all thank him for when\nYou're never really know what this game looks like an incredibly entertaining match up and we'll know sub so much more about both teams win this game is over in the meantime enjoy college football at its best and the guy off [laughter]\nIt's it's it's\nLike you say it's intriguing because both teams can run both teams have defenders who can\nDefend the run 'em we know about Benny ... now and how he is Ron and he runs physical he runs angry uh he he runs as Jim Bo was saying and you're going to talk about it in in our pre game show but similarities with other running backs\nBut you have a Josh Eleanor Kentucky likes to stop the run it can also get to the quarterback you've got an a and M. defensive line that kind of broke out last week against Arkansas and when that defensive line plays like that\nIt helps the line backers attack and it also helps your secondary I there is no mistake that down to the Wilson was able to get an interception just seal that game it all starts up front doesn't it or there's no question about it and\nThis team is going to have to we've already talked about both quarterback for run the ball like bring the out both Terry Wilson for Kentucky and kill them on for a year now\nThe Aggie defensive live main responsibility is going to be that keep him in a bar and we cannot let him hurt us with his legs he has to where we have to keep him in the pocket and making throw the football I mean have they don't misunderstand he's not a bad passer\nBut he's a much better runner than he is a pastor and uh if if we have to choose one or the other which is an\nThrowing the ball does it help at all that a and M. has faced quarterbacks similar to him that they wanted to keep them\nIn am has faced quarterbacks similar to him that they want us to keep it in the pocket I I'm thinking about you a lemon and Caleb evidence that their their quarterback for Louisiana Munro does it help that there's a little bit of familiarity for that for this\nDefend Oh absolutely and the Clemson quarterback was a very good running quarterback so yeah it certainly helps when you've seen it before and speaking of that that's the other thing that I have some concerns about even though I ask Jim Turner about this yesterday\nThe defense that Kentucky will bring into kind of field is a three fourths right\nAnd that's something that they haven't seen a lot of it Jim told me yesterday they've seen a little bit of it he was not concerned about it they worked hard on it but that three force that can give you some problems with the the different stunts that are that the the defensive linemen uh can perform with those linebackers you've got an extra linebacker\nOr that's in the box and a little bit of extra speed\nSo we we've got to be smart the offensive line has to make sure they know who they're supposed to block because the last thing you want to do is have somebody come free and all that does just blow up a play and perhaps cause of turnover those types of things so they all kinds of life is going to have to be very very good today\nThis was was a Kentucky team that was playing a four to five in years past and you're right it is a three four more like a three four so uh if we go with recent history that Alabama's defensive front was more of that three down Lyman\nAnd using their to outside linebackers again a little familiarity and the memory bank for this for this all sense of lie\nWell in talking to the coaches yesterday that they they play those outside linebackers and this\nAnd there are three four front they get them outside and what they're trying to do is make sure that you have to struggle a with the the the the sweeps with the outside runs and if you've got linebacker sitting out there to to come up and force those outside runs it pretty much\nLimit you to running up the middle yeah uh and it'll be interesting to see what kind of game plan or this or the Aggie off and says uh coaches have come up with a to attack this uh this different type of defense\nI we talk about Benny Snell being the leading Russia and the SEC in seventh and the nation coming in today um and maybe we all forget [laughter] right behind him astray beyond way but I certainly I forgot that I have no not at all and he was he was instrumental in and I and I want to say that um that\nFinal drive by a and M. as a fence of Dr when they scored to make it twenty four ten that was that the right type of drive the right length of\nDrive a it kind of set the tone type of Dr he was a big part of that for them making that a twenty four ten gay and they they needed a long drive like that well he's not just a big part of that Dr he's a big part of this off\nAnd and uh and the running back ... for a and M. with this ... is going to be big no matter what because Jim but wants to run the ball right\nOr not that we want to throw it and we throw it effectively but crazy on and I think we're going to see some more of Jay Sean Corcoran you're in this game after a after what he did last week\nA Kwame yet we all of them are going to be involved in this uh offensive running game and but I like the thought that that will brought up yesterday or he thinks that ah the the team that throws the ball the best today down to you and I guess a is going to be the team that prevails and we'll just have to wait and see about\nThat yeah I'm I Want I Want you all if you're listening and you're going to be listening tonight or if you take a peek a\nDon't be surprised if you see that number seven line up as a wide receiver today I'm just saying it may have been something that we saw I'm just saying I Hope Kentucky's not listening but that\nJumbo loves I asked him this week during his coaches show he talks time and again we've got to get the ball and number five chance\nJoyous jumbo flat out can I also put that number seven there and he said absolutely this this freshman is is is special and ... and it's not just because of the hundred yard return that was a glimpse of all that he can do but they're really high on Jay Sean core\nWe're sure he's got a great speed and they certainly could have got good hands it certainly could be one of the receivers that we see trying to replace our number one receiver ... who's not going to be able to play and we don't know when he's going to be back so if you can groom a freshman a true freshmen that is shown speed\nYour head museums the Americans he I strive to present are passed on our veterans and as you can see through

we weren't favorite for\nI Know what I'm seeing here than in the life of me being afraid of them are just we have good leadership over there and Campbell embarrassed\nAnd all those guys in um\nYou know we we when it came out and find more than I Am a\nMan from the regular relief or you know I mean it got going closer towards the end for\nReporters out there and we had a really good\nCoach actually got a chance to talk with random Stuart this week uh for our weekly podcast traps round over the ... do you want and just say the first thing that you guys based on a lot of aspects of that season but their quarterback and just going back and forth a brain and coming in for that championship game I mean that was a true some special\nWhatever sort of a testimony to the character of of Randy am brand than the way that quarterback thing evolve throughout the year I told a group a few months ago when I talk to the other show where the guys from there the rural lawyer\nThat really allowed us to win a championship you know instead of being selfish you know wondering what's in it for me we had a bunch of team player and a friend or most one of those guys robbed a lower your sister for lots of stars\nBuddy and still counting around in the end disruptive to the team he's like\nTotally hear stuff all street he continued through for prayer and then when he was off as soon as he said he was ready for and he allowed us to win the chance to cheer for the way it is a prayer of the other guy was like a park\nOr you know was not a starter and lower you would've liked to a friend of ours but he stayed here stuff all year and then he has ended up for re remember forever for those of scoring play to win the game I can just say that sounds good\nTeams for they learn to instill in terms of I mean we live they learn to think in terms of a shower\nAnd these guys do the job of that is really anyone I've ever seen a lot\nMore with little or whatever was a complaint is a lot of scares I Know where you're going to like a curative every now and have a buddy he never used for the team and want to call the quality of a great job\nI'm thinking here the fans cheer for a\nWhile they were I think back to the next year we're blaming the local village I look back at that game I was given to them are ever down like what if I ever dial that ball game or might be thinking about let me get a loan for a minute I Wonder if I can go now we're probably want to\nSpot he he can do a little bit of those other guys or roller skates\nAre back in ... body I mean\nYou know so I that's one of our regrets drugs are scratching their song\nIs for sure for sure I'll give it to him every now and there's a game when we threw the ball I Wish I'd rather just pounded here or there and see what what's your third without a richer richer the special Sawyer\nAnd make sure\nYou know he invested a lot in in uh he wanted to make sure they were not do you get totally without ready for so\nEvery day and frankly you may turn around with working hard to make sure I was working harder in the waiting room\nAnd uh for the first couple of you know through my career I didn't catch the ball at all from west on uh\nUh for the first couple of games you know during my career I didn't touch the ball and all that much on and I had to earn it you know for me because we had to earn it and uh when it came rented in Nebraska game we saw some of their deepest that we could we could use and and he wanted to put in a food bank die\nAnd it just so happened that I ended up running for Seventy one yard but that's how ... was he made sure that I was ready\nWe can and week out and as I got better and was able to handle more he will give me a little bit more\nYou know I wasn't the fast is or or or the most if the guy but I was heart attack and then he like that within the game when we\nPlay so much like the deepest we wanted to keep the ball and keep control of the clock so he will let me run about within the game\nAnd coach for you or I mean plenty of guys that came up big throughout that season we talked about uh you know more being one but with somebody who you feel like really ... the most throughout the year somebody who came in and and maybe wasn't necessarily on the radar to begin but just finished a year out strong and really helped a help play a big role in that championship\nI don't know I'd be so hard because we have we played as a team you know Dan Campbell was\nTied in a sit down to note uh yesterday so with this in these down coaching with the New Orleans saints and can't be here\nBuddy received such a leader yells unselfish guy playing tied in any kind of an emotional physical kind of leader you know he was tough enough guy and practice in uh

Budweiser\nHorse coach Jim both Fisher visited with the media this last Monday talking about the game against Arkansas today TNT stadium and talking a whole lot about this Kentucky wildcat football team much improved this is the first SEC home game for head coach jumbo pitchers the Aggies\nTake on the Wildcats University of Kentucky head coach march do served as pressure deep into coordinator on his first three Florida State teams from two thousand tend to two thousand and twelve\nKentucky is one of two conference schools at Texas a and M. has not based\nIn football since joining the FCC in two thousand twelve matter of fact as we've told you that it's a very very short series only twice these two teams have met before and it dates back to the Nineteen fifties that's right Nineteen fifty three was the last meeting in Lexington Aggies one that one seven six\nBefore that the year before in College Station Nineteen fifty two ... lost that one\nTend to go jumbo Fisher talking to the media this last week\nEvaluating the film a great job our team coming out with a victory\nIn the game or you know every time you play Robert gaming and SEC game there was a big games and very important to come out on top of things uh you know as we look at all the different phases of the game a really you know channels are team to start quickly\nWhen media saying we did that got a great return got a great three now scored on off into first Dr got up did a great job have good intentions and the game we did\nAnd I think play with and then have read intelligent systems in the game and that's where at times more in office and defense that we ... we didn't play with enough consistency at times with a silly pony here in ... mistake with the ball had some opportunities\nAnd all and all three phases that we could have done a little better but we're ... we're still progressing still like to weigh we're progressing I just hope we can try to be going a little faster and learn when you get someone down not to give them hope again try to stay on top of them to where you're you can relate unless you stay on top and we did that at times but then it was very critical in the game we lost momentum and the game a couple of times\nThink that what happened with Kentucky football in here they are out a little bit like Aggie basketball right I mean when the Aggies get Roland\nGood thanks it reminds me a lot of that were when there are good people are interested\nIn when Agnew basketball's really good people show up or when they're planning a big game people showing Florida comes to Kentucky people show up back that was a this Kentucky seems a little bit like that and their role and and it seemed like just\nGet over that thirty one year hurdle of beating Florida and all of a sudden it's a windfall right now for them to play an extremely good football I think and it was a better football team I think I Am the benefit of cow filled especially\nAt your last shorts weather so better enjoy it\nIt's Ninety degrees out here and he's been holding out on his ...\nHe was covered like this and it was hotter neck and I realized if I go back like this and it's got to the front all of a sudden I get to say see he's been holding out on a blocking everything what has been has man\nDo longer the small guy I was when Nineteen Ninety eight dry well we you know but they don't yet which when we this one of those crazy schedules so you guys might\nThink of another one I Can't think of one off in\nBetween weeks three and we tend there's one home game this is crazy it's not going to be like this next year\nBut because of that just another reason for the fans that come pack this thing out or there's a there\nIs a level of uh these recruiting the coaching staff no doubt is getting as many recruits in here as possible\nTo come and visit with between week three and we tend this is your one opportunity and I think the place is going to be packed out and we'll make an impact on this football game which I think will be\nFour quarters struggle and will be extremely tight well I've got a twenty four twenty number on this game and I'm winning I I Would say Kentucky and the points but I like taxes and then the one that's football game or a very tight game this is a team that doesn't have a lot of laws whose Kentucky there are a lot like the good Missouri team's ability talked about this bird a great point yesterday when people are those Missouri\nTeams all that coaching coaching staff was uh they didn't have a lot of turnover so there's a lot a ton of continuity and you know and would that get a lot of upper class when you're able to build it the right way build that maybe they don't have a lot of holes they don't have a\nTon of superstars across the board like somebody's west you play but it's a lot like those Missouri teams in the past he got a couple of first round talents on the roster like Alan ... players but not a lot of holes on that Roger I think they're a good team is going to be tough challenge\nWhere you are talking about holes and as you said across the board especially defensively they look very very good but about the only thing that you can point out is that they can get one dimensional\nOn opposite sad to say there are there not been tremendous they've won five straight games are fine but oh what what they've been doing fine they can get one dimensional\nThey will rely on that run down and the thing that works in a in his favor is that they are so good against the raw right and so when you're looking at the top ranked rushing off into the FCC versus the top ranked rushing defense and the SEC I think that's going to bode well for Texas a and M. especially being here at home\nWell let's hear what the date on that thought about what the defense is done here this year uh for the Iraqis\nOwe the deans religious sets us up to be in position you know got a lot of fast moving together and um we're just really getting the food and just taking advantage of it is just ... go home just almost a year prior to going to get penetration boom line backer plays in really good that's a\nThat's a big help 'em and then we're just we're just making planes you know it's just fun to take on the phone with a ...\nMillion I think those are definitely the first time since I've been here that every last one of those darn long and got a sex so that was big goes on to be able to get out the ah the passer and I think that's a testament that we've been playing in the run ...\nHave you guys scene louder eight tackle performance through five games and what they're doing right now and as your numbers don't matter 'cause I got is dominating the football game right now\nTommy Harris it Oklahoma had very suppress numbers because he got a double team all the time yeah and that this is a lot like the same thing\nDefenses are scheming to stop Mac and that's opening up other guy he's still winning their steam and he's getting well here's the ... already five tackled the first round picking it like I mean ESPN doesn't even have highlights of him just showing this draft packing right because you have doubled or tripled teamed every fall yeah yeah\nAnd that's the thing with Dale and I think with bringing in a new coach it's allowed this this breath of fresh air you got Mike Schmidt has been working them out all offseason judgment yeah Jim curious mix you Michel ... player back on the day but that being said yeah you got your Smith is working these guys out in the entire off season\nAnd they let us finally uh he's he's turned into the Phoenix we all knew he could be\nHe's a good player man and he's got good players around him\nJust a matter of being gay if you're going to double him or you can't double 'em all you know and then Kiki if you go out and watch the game against Arkansas probably more than even the other ones but in all of 'em this has been the case\nI mean they're playing them three jak they're playing him at one time when they get down off the field especially maybe third down along type situation Kiki inside they're playing them outside weak side defensive in I don't plan of standing up what they're doing Durham and Thomas ... uh in Thomas or I'm Sorry Johnson right\nBut it but don't play 'em on both sides wrong side we got all over the line you can't find the guy and then you've got mad at me came back who were doing exceptional things down inside in the trenches I\nAnd that's the key you got good line backers but it starts with those guys up front the epicenter your defense is why and him six in the country and run ... that's a great good on a good match up today\nAnd one of the things you just talked about strengthening conditioning\nI watch Oklahoma who is I didn't think would be great but they're not strong enough anymore no and I and I look and I see that a names gotten stronger in Oklahoma Scott weaker with one coach going from that program\nTo this program yeah no there's there's there's something to do that I mean there is a reason why that is and I think that's what jumbo Fisher knowing that coming in and knowing how the Aggies at least in the recent seasons have been able to benzene ring out I mean obviously that's facing conditioning was the biggest thing one of the biggest things coming in\nAnd let me ask you this gave that to the question mark for this hacking football team is corner fly okay now do you think Kentucky's a team that can take advantage of that or is there lack of strengthen the passing game really take away the one weakness today and yeah I hear what\nYou're saying there's a good on good something's got to give a battle here and that is run into football and it can run the ball Kentucky can stop the wrong Kentucky can really run the ball and has to\nOh Kentucky can stop the wrong\nKentucky can really run the ball and has to they probably have to play in a tight game\nThey don't want to get behind have to throw it a bunch\nOf but a and M. is doing it except for the job of stopping that something's got to give right there now their weakness\nReally as a team as they're receiving corps you can actually make a strong case to North western state with a five star transferred from LSU the four star transferred from Texas second shorts and burgers and\nThat northwest state a directional one double a school after yes actually has a better receiving corps than Kentucky okay ah but that's their only real weakness and Terry ... he's not great at throwing anywhere from five to probably twenty yards but he can actually hit a couple of people so that scares you there I'll say not really but there is a caviar\nIf you get them into those kind of second in three\nThirty two type situations where there are still probably going to run it\nAnd then all of a sudden effects the give and it looks like he's going to take the the keeper at all and all of a sudden I Dream about four years ago but it's our P. O. because all of a sudden Donald and Wilson has bit and you're one on one and I'm gonna take a shot to voting down field\nOr their CJ Conrad in a and M. is covering up the tide and he's only got eighty nine yards even on the year but he's talented C. J. Conrad you don't want it to match that production in this game the tight end scares you because he is a potential NFL players\nLimiting the big white as that goes on and and\nBeing able to tackle being able to wrap up I mean that's been something that ate him showed that they had at least improved a little bit against Arkansas but what are you going to do when you've got a guy like many Snell is used to getting guards after ... he's coming at you and as gay mentioned you know\nAre you going to be so focused in on the run game right now and Wilson Wilson they will sink in bird you with the ball that's has what you worry about\nRun through this list of running backs though that I Am I missing\nAlready this year oh no doubt at the end of the back at a Monroe is not bad no Alabama trainer that well yeah exactly and Damien Harris is very good obviously analogy Harris\nOkay then last week you're you're up against her keyboard or they can go it's good for them is is built and has experienced already physical guys running downhill at\nAll right and they had him as in a lot of fifty yard Russia yeah from the running back position in the only got the the leading Russia against day in and this year isn't even on a football team right now Kelly Ron leading individual rush you're going to say and and this year is going to quarterback Kelly right who's no longer a glimpse of\nSo and em as ... and they faced extremely good running games where did you dream Lee good running backs I made Travis ed pianos ran for like four hundred and fifty yards and the three games in say an Emmy ransom forty yes in that game broke off one on it too I mean yeah yeah yeah and first contact was right there he he\nMissed on two different plays missed a couple of taxes and the secondary and those are at the end drunk\nAnd they offered those crazy that there was so much about my calico coming in and he's an exceptional guy quite frankly\n... fan base has been jaded to think that it was not going to be good defense and that's crazy round school you get jaded and then they'll come comes in and does it and it's like hey wow this is this is what we've been waiting for for a generation\nThat he's getting helped out to buy is often it's jumbos doing a a spectacular job as a play color of and as a head coach he's got to where both athletes play color but he's the head coach\nAnd he's got to do what it takes to play winning football yeah not just winning off ants but winning football the fact of the matter is an EMS averaging fifty five different to play the game right now two years ago there averaging Seventy nine plays the game and last year they average about Seventy three plays a game and through five games their average and fifty five snaps I mean their own pace\nCool blue shield shoes Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas court to carry through it all\nCapital form good age to gather we're better fewer Texas for dealers Ford is the question is can destroy

bluegrass\nWill thank you very much and we heard jumbo Fisher after walk through we talked about it's not who you're playing but how you play the game he wants\nTo seem to be balanced every week he wants them to have the same effort on the same preparation every week no matter who they are playing and he the exactly right that's how you prepare than when consistently\nKentucky Wildcats are led by their running back then he smelled junior he is tops in the SEC when it comes to Russia back we wanted\nTo within the conference in rushing it now and the Trayvon Williams of am we have two very similar quarterbacks as well that get hurt you outside the pocket Jerry Wilson for Kentucky and ... who we've seen take that next step from his freshman season so many interesting matchups between these two\nVery very similar and I said that in the pre game but uh we got to good op ed that like to run the ball we've got to good defenses that stopped there on something got again\nWe shall see
