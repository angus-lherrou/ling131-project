W College Station Bryan\nJust have this preoccupation [noise] many preoccupation\nOf as of late Saturday meeting the\nSearch for extraterrestrial intelligence Institute and of course there is meant to be the messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international\nSaid he deals with searching for Methodist from aliens many on the other hand there are signs of deals with the creation of messages that they want to send a aliens with SETI enmity proponents have quite different prospective cities scientists are in position to address only the question does active search for extraterrestrial intelligence makes sense\nIn other words would it be reasonable force\nIn other words would it be reasonable for SETI successor the search for us to address real intelligence success would it be reasonable to transmit with the object of attracting\nExtraterrestrial intelligence that attention well many looks for wasting which we might be able to contact aliens instead of waiting to hear from them like SETI does however this does not mean that organizations like many international are without ideas on how we might better listen to our potential instructional intelligent after all\nA communication goes beyond mere messages and also requires the medium exists with which to convey the message they need something to decode or otherwise interpret the messages and so\nYou have the need for multiple methodologies to increase the odds of finding something and there's also the problem doing what to look for\nBut we've been shown in many Hollywood movies how we should communicate or how we could communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence in the film close encounters of the third kind scientists communicated with music in light they had a music in light Oregon they played the aliens responded in the movie a rival\nScientists had to use linguistics or linguists and marine biologist to read the ... communications what were called ...\nThey were technical create a ... there were technical creatures that are remaining in an environment that suited for them and their space part and that was amazing show I mean more so it was kind of dry dragon wasn't really your typical science fiction but it was amazing to see how they came up with the idea how the aliens would communicate it was a special way to communicate\nAnd how linguist took like years may now they don't necessarily I think demonstrate that but they took years to come up with the idea on how to communicate with the alien\n\nAnd we've been shown a various ways that the aliens would make contact with us and uh\nMost of what we see in films are like radar ... you know we see this radar blip you know what is it oh it'd be aliens trying to talk or we have sound signals that can be a decoded by the magic of computer tech in mathematics remembering contact they had been scraping noise\nAnd when they were able to do that because of scraping noise it sent back a video clip of the Olympics and they saw Hitler and everybody panicked and and uh because uh they didn't know that the weather what they were getting was one of the first television programs\nIt was broadcast and ah this is what they saw and they send it back but it was saying oh they're not Caesar's based on the though my God I thought that was pretty I I thought it was pretty scary actually I mean I think that you know the aliens first signals they send back to us or or signals from the you know German Olympics the Nineteen thirties\nSo I mean we show in various ways ah the aliens can talk to us through mathematics computer tech as well speaking through a computer or this is another way that we've always imagined see this is where our imagination is limited especially now with apparently something has happened\nWhere both SETI enmity are beginning to act as though they are located something in space but are not capable of explaining it to the public I get that feeling I don't know if you get that feeling but I get that feeling I get the feeling\nThat after they're a techno signatures workshop in Texas I get the feeling that after a members of the group like such shows back in and are they going to Jill Tarter but he said well you know they bet in Irvine, California and they said we ... we need to rethink\nOur position here as a\nAs astronomers and scientists and those who wanted to find communication we may have it already\nBut we have in the form of technological signatures we don't have in fact we don't have aliens chirping at us from another planet we don't have signals coming from the planet we have fast radio burst their big flashes of light that come in that could be you know from spaceships they're saying alien spaceship can produce vast radio burst but there's something else though\nOr something else we touched on a few few days ago or maybe in a week ago he was uh from what I've been reading lately\nBut take those things your clothes are far more advanced as we've been told we also maybe under the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ear as picked up on the signal that they say maybe ... ... this was creepy okay\nThere are indications I don't want to panic you but there are indications that the aliens have been sending signals and only certain people have picked up on them because they're so faint or they\nThey're they're they're buried in the noise of the cities and sometimes when you went in the mountains or gotten the desert you can hear the signals being sent\nAnd some people are more and more acute they ... they have a curiosity and they're able to hear these sounds and their pulse things down okay um [noise]\nAnd this is where it gets weird because it makes you wonder if the aliens have been sending some sort of a sonic sound you know like those horns those angel horns we've been hearing well yeah they said that they were solar storms and maybe they were the result is sort of storms or maybe kind of a thunder caused by a ... a ...\nBut it's also the theory that these are sounds\nThat are being picked up by the human ear that are actually\nPart of these waves that they'd been detecting over the planet and only certain people can hear them in some of them have even been recorded [noise] so we got a few recordings for tonight and these are really eerie because I'm sure many of you've heard the sounds of thought about I just got tonight is or something but listening will have an upcoming uh forty\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] you know in the background what you're hearing is you're hearing snow mobiles going over the snow but if you listen you can hear even sound of a ... that's the window ... something was humming and bending the area in August it was a reporter but even more annoying ... some residents\nBelieve just coming from an area near ... proving ground that's Utah a deadly proving grounds is divided in two parts we have the army that operates the northern portion which houses most of the residents there\nAnd then there's the southeast portion it's operated by the airport so the runway large enough to lend an aircraft the size of a space shuttle I Know this portion isn't necessarily a talked about all the types of the secret area of dead weight\nIs there has been developed an expanded since two thousand four we've increased security build up the additional infrastructure is what many UFO conspiracy theorist to conclude that this is the news site where the government is testing secret military in UFO technology sort of northern arm of area fifty one\nI Want to play this hominid this um is even more annoying and scary listen to this\n[noise]\n\n\n\nIt's very low base come and this this is making my ears ring by the way because the headphones on and I heard the home it's being my ears ring the other one was a little bit low more PC\nYou're on the middle of nowhere you thinking what can be caught in that little based tone you know what can be readily my house is low based tone because it's not somebody driving by and they're you know they're low writer you know it's a boom boom boom it's not that I that that happened before where somebody's like\nParked underneath my window Whelan sleeping and I can hear the low frequency come I realized oh it's some guy you know playing this is a you know low base listening to eat it dumped step for something else so you know I have to go wow you know it's a little loud but this is in the middle of nowhere does way he's out in the middle of nowhere really it's out\nOf the salt flats um I Believe is into all the county so yeah since I've been there I've been to Doug way I was escorted out of there by ah\nBy the security there I mean the military showed up told me that I needed to leave they were nicer to me but then ... showed up and the guy looked like some Nazi with it with a gun and he told me to get off the property ... the actually escorted us we were to care of and we're doing a a\nA TV documentary uh for the ... channel called the unknowns zone we were doing it as a pilot never got off the ground but uh we were there and doing the pilot and a were\nStopped by the military saying get away from the ... the area where like I said like what five hundred six hundred feet away from the gate where we're nowhere near the gate but apparently they said that we were looking suspicious they want us out of there and then of course whacking that stepped in and said you know we want you off the property and we're going to escort you out to all the county if you come back we'll bust you\nAnd so they drove us to the great Salt Lake and then that's all she wrote you know they turn around and went the other direction but it's very quiet out that way I mean it's it's it's quiet you're you know you're out in the middle of nowhere and you don't hear birds you do hear radios you don't hear anything out there it's just just damn damn quiet\nI don't know if anybody if any have you been to area fifty one Rachel I haven't been Rachel, Nevada by here it's also very quiet and Rachel's very quiet in a\nIn the areas near area fifty one because it sounded a bit of a desert so I'm sure\nYou know you pick up on these types of sounds and and like I said the pulse wave in northern Sweden do was in a place where the snow just fallen and uh once again I Want to play that says this is the sound though that everybody's attention because\nYou know well it's not all that any president not as I don't think it's just impressive is when you dug way but it's still got that low frequency bit rattled the house listen to this\n[noise]\n\n\nNow it's really hot it's uh I actually took my headphones off and let the big speakers in the studio ... it was like I could feel my whole body somebody my a Philly my spine was tingling or something so yeah it's\nPretty amazing these homes okay alright started on this because we don't get any feedback that was weird okay the feedback we have speakers are so to speak is off a catch ... studio ... myself out so the question is that good these Homs\nBe connected to the test of secret spacecraft or is it a single is being sent from extraterrestrial intelligence in the form of gravity pulses that are picked up by people who are sensitive pulses\n... he remembered yet and if anybody remember the the recording I played of\nTwo police officers who was a cold morning about four thirty in the morning near saint Helen's Oregon so well known recording of up to police officers and they record the sound of a of a huge light sitting on the Columbia River and it's a UFO and they they basically key up she radio\nAnd it sounds it sounds almost the same right it sounds the same ah but you know they see something that sounds like a large diesel motor rubbing up and then of course taking off ... it's just you know so compelling here these officers you know you know talking with one another\nAbout what they're experiencing what they think nothing was said during these to Homs\nAbout what they're experiencing what they're seeing nothing was said during these two homes because they just wanted everybody to get the feeling of a home I'm sure they want to say anything I mean there is a sequence of you look up the video up on the Internet there is a sequence where you hear a snowmobile go by which I think ruin the mood\nBut I mean uh I'm sure the guy just do a bill didn't care is that the guy was doing when he was doing their own civil bill's really didn't hear it but in the quiet do you really can't hear that rumble and you'll be hearing rumbling in the sky\nSo uh and so this is where you know we have to wonder what are these rumbled we have to know what are these sounds you know these are signals being sent to us from space\nAre they extraterrestrial aircraft or something else I mean but they ... they were saying ah just recently the dealings can be trying to contact us by other means and I would say\nThat uh [noise] what's going on right now is the city is setting us up ... up Mayer setting us up for a yeah it's part of the day a wee bit setting and stuff I think for disclosure or at least to tell us that we have detected something but they do not know how to report it nor do they know how to identify it\nBut yet the sound is keeping your these little rumbles these horn found all this stuff happening makes you wonder if they are all

I wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the initial groups um because he suffered from terrible depression but\nThere was a woman there with stage ... cancer Linda and so we\nWe decided to go with her but when I had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying\nBiochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got a he got cold and he had a low lottery number in the very last years of the the Vietnam War and they'd done away with draft deferments for college um college students so we had to go in the last\nHorrible chaotic years of the war and it was so traumatic for him he came back was really depressed and that continued in his life he even even lost the love of his life too\nFast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he he got to meeting me he got to a point of feeling like what's the use and he was living in a senior facility\nYou barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed so he does his intention for Linda\n[noise] and then that the next day he told me he woke up and everything had really changed it was um\nDay he told me he\nWoke up and everything had really changed it was almost like he had this amazing heightened sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been he drank a cup of herbal tea and it knocked his socks off he says\nUm but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision on a dream almost like a vision where he was back in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd the the Nineteen year old with communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time and\nThat experience to him was so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is\nPower walking Ninety minutes the lifting weights he's running group says it's at his church is writing is trying to write again he's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder\n[noise] um and this is a story I hear over and over again where that\nActive being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows the sender need to have any special abilities\n[noise] well here's the really interesting thing of it you know I again did not believe that if I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nWorld could we say you were the skeptic of all skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I I started the intention experiments because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this manifestation law of attraction I didn't\nI wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know are we talking about the shifting a quantum particles are we talking about curing cancer here so I'm definitely set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is I had\nA life universities the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of power to let their neural science department look at this so we set up a group of students and we put a eat Jake kept to measure the brain waves of\nEach one person one center in each of the groups and\nWhat we found was so amazing that within a few minutes they would have this completely different brainwaves signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate\nAnd also the parts of the brain that make us have worried doubt negativity so these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctors said Stephanie Sullivan\nUm we looked at other things like\nUh the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks any static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature but the only difference was\nI had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sushi master sure my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation\nAnd all they had with a twelve minute video for me\nWas to do when we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to

this\nNo it doesn't I think what it takes is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender and also to intend well a new group\nBut for me the thing the real key element is\nCreating a little group of eight or so and you asked before\nThey have to be eight no fiber work\nEleven to work you know age is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little um but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after\nI'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see\nIf everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health so I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year and it was extraordinary of the\nPeople who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them\nPretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health\nYou know they got financial wind falls or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted um just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but it pretty much everybody\nHad extraordinary stories to tell\nOur ... are are you sure that this works uh primarily from the ... or ... science behind\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study and we found that you know\nThere are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of in a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer because you have these major changes\nWhich are really very\nVery much similar to somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience people get changed during the kinds of experiences and they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know\nSomething major his change all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future and so in a way that starts to\nPave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes and and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember this Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects and when I started looking into um\nThe science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer\nAre happier are healthier in every regard and nuts what we found in a lot of our intention groups I mean when I talk about that group in twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy\nWas going through a divorce and she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself start intending for someone else and she was one of the people who was intending for that young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so can I tell you any everything about how this works\nYou're absolutely not [laughter] there's a complete X factor here I don't understand\nBut there is something about that power of getting off for yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get a reward for you\nBut you're convinced it works aren't you\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at it\nSteady in groups over years um you know I run I run these year long mastered classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were gonna do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr then I'll do some Olin that don't get results in the ...\nWell I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year\nAnd there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away\nRight there and um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't you know thought to themselves yeah right and they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed\nBut a lot of them you know there's enough\nTo say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd now you're interested in the healing because it's easier to track in terms of the ... the ...\nOh you mean a physical healing well yeah because it is not eat the the the ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions growing up we had a woman with stage ... cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too\nYou know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it ride along somebody else we've P. M. J. problems those temperature ... joint problems in your jaw and uh that she was\nSort of suffering with the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two and then the pain was gone over days so this kind of thing you know it's kind of this healed in an instant or soon after\nIs the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing synchronous a cheese happened you know another woman who was\nTrying to write a book she was a body work um expert Lisa\nAnd she was in one of these year long groups and she was trying to write a book about she figured out a way to treat\nTrauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she'd never written a book and she was getting no where she had three different editors and just nothing was happening and at the group is intending for nothing was happening and finally once again it leads to get off for yourself and she started it\nIntending to another member of the group who had some ... serious health issues and again the next week she has she\nFeels compelled to go into a store and she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets somebody she vaguely\nBeen introduced to before and as they got chatting it turns out this woman was a former publisher and he's now a book coach and when she hears what Lisa wants to do she offers to coach or through the whole thing\nEnd of story Lisa gets her book done and it becomes an Amazon bestseller so I've seen this over and over enough to to have the doubting Thomas in me start getting pretty persuaded but something amazing is going on here\nThey don't six nine three sixty one hundred with the strong bone program\n\nTake all our Brian broadcasting stations everywhere on your mobile

not a bad thing to do and you're formulating an intention\nAnd if a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich\nAnd you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is they don't want the job there in\nWhat they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich um what they want is more time\nTo spend with their children or grandchildren and so\nWhat you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tells the universe exactly what you want and\nThe other thing I noticed George is often times the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like\nUm I have one group one master class a intention group of eight and they said what were intended for all of us to win the lottery\n[laughter] and I said to them why what do you need and they said well\nGene needs twelve thousand dollars I'm for child\nAnd Joe needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you you know so\nIt's it's really about\nFirst of all figuring out what you want\nExactly and then telling\nEach of her because she wanted to know exactly what he was an opportunity for you to talk with Lou Mick Jagger in about intention will start by going to Thomas a mobile

past and the future and you cite ... how much met a job up here a group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show\nThat you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can use utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes in workshop semi just random retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intention\nOne I tend to do though is you can't\nChange the past of what of what happened in the sense of\nIt happened what you can do though is change your response to it and going forward and in a way that is\nPart of this whole thing of time being really elastic time being one big smeared out now and that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that and this is a weird thing um\nWe don't change the past we changed the president as it unfolds the future affect the present as it unfolds all the studies show but just to answer your question why tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nTo moment in their health just when something\nJust started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument\nArgued with somebody in a relationship and it then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were terrible at something\nWe just just did something like that and go back and change your response to that teacher and you say no I'm not used to set math I just don't understand is now I Will later something like that or imagine that that\nHealing that that illness doesn't blow up into full blown disease I'm actually had somebody who got ... from an infection go back and imagine that time and I swear to you she told us her skin was starting to re pigment\nIn the workshop it was extraordinary and loads of people where\nThey were they were told something and it's in his sense released it for them going forward so it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with ritual intention because\nEven scattered physicists now are saying to us all um\nYou know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I say like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here hey rich go ahead\nYeah they can you hear me

killings and I think that I it was really shocking to me that\nIt wasn't just health that we've healing 'cause you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that um but\nFor instance Natalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this she was one of the receivers in a power of age group and she wanted her intention to be that her family\nBusiness expand in all directions and be prosperous in all ways and [noise] and\nShe and her husband had a computer support business but it it didn't build on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that one of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere and they were really worried because they had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about\nA decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that she was going to have to take a job\nI'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive so she can't during the group session she kept visualizing both her and mark opening up their car doors and money filling out and afterward\nHer feeling about it or fear and their

months she they learn not only\nDid that major client decide to stay with them but they completely diversified their client list and she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind

you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying\nYou know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow\nI Would really be interested to find that\nThat um a lot of people\nA lot of people ... dreamed that nine eleven I'm a ... attack um Rupert shelled break did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it of\nPlanes going

picking up all\nAll kinds of information ahead of time it's not beyond the you know the realm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happen we're thinking about it the key though is I think\nBeing really specific as I mentioned before and also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his his illnesses you know his pain\nAnd I really got to say that the one way is to get a power of eight grouped together because let them in ten for you be very specific about where your pain is that you want to kill the

whole lot of people out there\nWho don't know how to do this they never voted before and\nThey just know that they're supposed to go vote so ... you know they think about that have you ever have you

made up something that didn't actually happen okay and they have the whole a grim doing that so is that a bad thing because now you're re creating an event that didn't actually happen what was he doing well he was ...\nAt a bad thing because now you're re creating an event that didn't actually happen what was he doing well he was there three different speeches\nAnd um and just one of them did not happen and so they created him for instance wearing his riding pants I think in in one of them and he makes makes remarks and they use real audio but just ... those things didn't take place under those circumstances\nWhich then brings up the question with that kind of technology is that the way museums are going to look in the future that we will kill people will believe the hologram as what that person actually look like and behaved as\nAnd I don't know if that's what museums are supposed to be doing right have you been to the president's a Disney at Disneyworld\nI did not go whenever we

really strange and how are you Sheila\nAnd great thanks for having me on the show today\nIt's an absolute pleasure thanks for taking the time you know it's interesting in this day and age we've got people on the left that'll say just about anything or even if it's devoid effect so having you on to clarify some things is really special for my own or use it for me so thanks a lot for taking the time\nIt's a pleasure so big announcement today um first\nOf all the left is saying the Democrats the opposition they're all saying that this president and write down the line to the ministry you included are doing everything you possibly can to squash and get rid of Obamacare when the reality appears to be you're making what's in place now better now I Wish it were something different but\nYou're making it better and you're expanding it so that people could actually afford it more can you tell my listeners what what it is that you did today which they are\nAnd you know very beginning at the time the president was elected he made it very clear that he wants Americans to have more for double options\nIn life and to have more choices in their health care and so we haven't focused on doing everything we can on the administrative level that doesn't involve Congress to try to deliver on products and I think what we show today is that the president has\nBeen successful and for the very first time since Obama Care started we've actually seen that premiums are going down now\nIt's only a drop it on at one point five percent yeah and we're still not satisfied because we know that there's millions of Americans that they'll find coverage and affordable on exchanges but I think that they show and it shows are critics that we are working to provide more affordable coverage to kill American\nIt is a sequel Burma and she is the administrator for um for the Obamacare marketplace well actually not for for Medicare and Medicaid services is now you've got that right\nSo if I'm hearing you right and if I read right what's happening today um in fact what we're getting is a ... you're seeing an expansion of competition more choices therefore that's pushing the the prices down is that what's going on\nEthics exactly at one of the things that we saw came\nInto this administration that many Americans only had one choice at carrier in fact last year fifty percent of county only had one carrier um we made real progress towards that and now that number decrease that we still have an area that the country\nThat don't have choices that that number has gone down and we're probably around thirty nine percent native real progress we got new carrier carriers that are coming in and there's some carriers that left and that are now actually coming back\nCarriers are moving in the more areas so as you know when there's more choice right Americans are going to get better quality you're going to get better prices\nAre where are you in it and that's great more competition does equal lower prices I mean that's just that's the basic business if you got one one piece\nThe more competition does equal lower prices I mean that's just that's basic business if you got one one peach enjoyed the Detroit really one repeats of you've got two or three is going to drive the price down to give you more choices\nUm we're also hearing bishop and again it's um it's uber machines the ministry of or Medicare and Medicaid and she's very positive news about these strangers about the availability of of lower priced healthcare although it's still way overpriced and that's going to be that's going to be examined closure but\nYou're also hearing from the left or this president is looking to get rid of any availability\nFor coverage for those who have pre existing conditions I just want to I Want to make a quick note to those watching television I think you ... your ... and would achieve like you know she's speaking make that happen to know all the radio stations or you're you're so\nI I just want to ensure that people understand what you're actually talking to somebody um she ... is is that the case that you see they're claiming on the left especially with the midterms coming up that the president is looking to get rid of any coverage for pre existing conditions and a better question is is he really doing\nAll the president's been very very clear from the beginning that he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions like he's been clear about that the secretary of health Alex days are Sinclair and I'm clear about that as well we will do everything that we can to make sure that people with preexisting conditions have the protections that they need and deserve\nOkay again for those who came here of the president is doing all the cabbage so is she ... and the people working on this\nOr they're doing all they can be key preexisting conditions covered the president said it again very directly yesterday I'm not trying to get with a pre existing conditions those who are saying that I Am\nOr making that up and I guess they're pointing to something about ... ... well I guess they're not putting anything it's just it's just Felicia's as it used is this really foods at all has the president ever said hey we should probably looking at I'm going to pre existing ... not yet\nI think he's always been consistent that he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions and I think the reality is our critics have been making all kinds of production they've been saying that the actions that the president's been taking is going to make things worse that it's going to increase the cost of health insurance and we're seeing from today's results of that is simply\nNot true there were actually think decreases one of the great things that the president did was he got rid of the individual mandate you and you know that was the penalty for\nPeople that couldn't afford health insurance in fact most of the people that were getting paralyzed or paying penalties eighty percent of those people were earning less than fifty thousand dollars a year and the president got rid of that\nAnd so you know that show he's very concerned about people that you know have they're facing challenges with all this on affordable coverage that demonstrates his commitment to providing choice and lower cost individual\nThat's absolutely but ignored that that's fine that penalty that touch and John Roberts or none of them so the fundamental deeds attacks which allowed a vat tax was was an orderly affecting people who were in the middle class\nAnd those people basically got their tax break through the tax cuts that their their bonuses from their jobs got their increases in pay and they stopped being taxed on duty for something they didn't want to purchase the image never talked about in the legacy media is\nThat's right I mean in fact what we are hearing that there were the dire predictions at the president got rid of the individual mandate if the president changed the regulations on you know the president allowed short term limited duration plans to get more affordable coverage to people that if we did those things\nPremiums would increase and I think the evidence shows today that that has not happened and in fact the reverse that happened ... lower premiums you know in the state of Tennessee premiums are going to go down to twenty six percent\nThat we have seen that since Obama Care started\nYeah that's amazing it is against you move over don't follow her it's S. E. M. A. lasted a VCR I may she used the uh the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid services um one last thing that I've only got a a quick second here there is no way we could ever afford Medicare for all could read it three ... dog will be social as you're talking about\nNow Medicare for all basically Medicare for now and that's what hurt seniors and it would sort of redirect to focus on the program elsewhere thirty two trillion dollars we can't afford it and it would hurt seniors\nAre uh she was saying should leave recall it into the great information and great job I was talking to All right thank\nYou we appreciate achievable machines the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid services with the Trump Administration some incredible information so the prices are starting to come down a little bit because they're expanding competition you remember then President Obama said that the average family which saved twenty five hundred a year they actually showed increase of about five thousand a year in their premiums\nAnd a lot of people were taxed or find\nA because they couldn't afford to healthcare so this was another positive step by the Trump Administration your thoughts on that\nAnd we'll give you an Kanye we come back eight eight nine four one passage deeper writer [noise]\nIn the hot air when she's not a concern you ah if you will not really quite affirmative action\nAnd you know the ... and this is all a re theoretically and they can stay in for him that no I think during the time um I I mean actually lock the\nHarvard University right right\nActually my favorite I Harvard University right and\nRight and you know they didn't have anything um\nYou know I call a in June they were you know those were allegedly allegedly happening again you can imagine the then you see it so I I I kind of accent\nDo you actually run one of the all help out a little bit what happens is these doors did it in their heads that his suicide has five percent Asian that's all you can have at Harvard and if it's got twelve or Thirteen percent black you have to have that and if it's a if it's you know forty percent Hispanic or thirty whatever you got to got to\nAnd it can be more than you know thirty or forty to forty percent white\nAnd if you do anything different than than suddenly you're racist in in ... thought they could fix that changed the admissions process by giving people more points if they happen to be black taking points away if you happen to be Asian and that's of course unfair now the court system so far\nHas said there were allowed to do that with Kevin on the court I guess the fear is that he's actually going to make it out of this is crazy but based on how how how a qualified you are based on your actual test scores\nInstead of basing it on somebody's skin tone their back rather a distributor or their heritage right right right next to me ... and so now there's been a little bit ... by the way to learn what forty miles north of where I'm sitting right now these dogs actually your taxes\nAre so that they put out an op ed so you know horrible will be going to take away the rights of anybody other than white men I guess\nYeah and I think it's a ... a senior in a way that\nIt has some where you have to wait quite a Supreme Court ah who are you do the poor are made of action um you know in University of Michigan by\nLooking at me and they actually were equal to\nJustify a bad thing I think strong enough or not\nOr if they couldn't justify because it's stupid or it is a car radios and she is a correspondent from campus reform
