I'm actually because I've got a record of this computer which I have but I actually did grab that piece of audio did you [laughter] it will be\nUsed as a future day oh that's\nIt will be managed and we'll be revisited it gets so we've got a great a great bunch of stuff going on care if you don't mind give me the latest on the care of him ... we'll probably start with the latest on the bombings or the ... the bomb threat whatever it is let's do that too we got mark laughter bottom of this hour he is from the GOP\nAnd he's also um the former right hand man the vice president Mike Pence he's ... he's still in\nWith the vice president in fact he was traveling with vice president yesterday and they were forced to how cool would that be\nVery cold going they're horseshoe why can't I go I Want to go to if you want to go on their land whirling\nVoted for very long time I've never seen a police officer in uniform voting but nobody's even alleging that the allegation by walking Castro who has a real problem with reality is that police officers were purposely patrolling inside of the parking lots of polling places\nAnd his allegation his suggestion was\nThat they were trying to intimidate people and if you see something like this happen get a hold of me that he signs it Joaquin as if he's a friend of every body will again let me reiterate the police chief tells me that the police department is not a political um outlet\nThere is no political basis for what they do they are there to protect and serve\nAnd he says they were not told to stay away from all polling places he said they very simply had been told that they may tell told any other day you go to where you're called or your needed\nAnd guess what carry the ball at a polling place and I feel like a crime is being perpetrated on me I Will call the police of the polling place mhm and then worldwide managed tells me they'll come\nBut other than that there really is no role the police department has at a polling place this thing by the far left writers in the city news reporters in the city and by walking Castro himself this has been reported as somehow they told the place to stay back away from polling place to protect your right to vote\nFor what I get from the chief there was no order the walking Castro could ever that he gave saying you're not allowed to be anywhere near a polling place that just simply\nDoesn't appear to be what happened here and I believe the guy he doesn't have a good reason to lie to me and I just now I I'm just now getting indication that in fact police can vote in their uniforms so if you're voting and you see a police show up in uniform get in line to go vote tough as his or her right to go and do that\nAnd and by the way if you're voting and usually a police officer or pass by on the road they are allowed to be there and people patrol now they're in the parking lot you've got a question as to why freak and ask them\nI've never heard of ... a police officer look at me in San Antonio or any other city usa and say I'm not going to talk to your citizen [laughter] you don't do that so again no political role for the police department they were not told don't patrol anywhere near a polling place\nAnd to be in the parking lot of a polling place they have every right to be there if they'd been cold there\nNow walking Castro in my opinion is starting trouble\nI keep in mind that the guy is he's a scary cat he's a he's a scared little guy he only talked to people on the left you only talk to people that he thinks things agree because what I had people on the show all the time the phone lines are open now call in and disagree with me I have every\nEvery desire to mix it up with somebody who disagree that a great you know back and forth today with a great friend of mine about an issue we can do that\nJoaquin Castro was in that kind of guy he doesn't have the vertebrate to do it doesn't have the spine to do it but this whole allegation that he somehow is giving orders to to the city over to the police department I Would buy it if I were you\nAnd him and let me finish on this no this is my personal opinion if you've got a problem or you're scared when you see a police officer the problem is with you it's not necessarily with him or her now they're acting out and they're misbehaving in and doing something outside of the realm of their job I'll listen to you and sometimes that happens\nBut stop all this you know the people versus the police walking Castro want you to be afraid of and hate the police and I'm here to tell you don't be\nLook what the last what I have I'm not I'm not afraid of the police you shouldn't be eight eight nine four packs a day nine four one Seventeen for seven Joe packs\nYou shouldn't be

Thirty years ago most of our immigration were single men coming from Mexico right\nRight now half of the immigrants are coming from Central America and many of them are coming with women and children because they know that if they get detained\nWe under court order and law cannot send them back right so they just release them into the middle of the country and with a wink and a nod hope you come back in a couple three four years when your court hearing comes around it's just not sustainable long term\nAnd so we want to be strong we want to be compassionate we can do both of those things but we just got to get enough conservative and just commonsense voices right in Congress to be able to get it done\nAs you know I grew up in South Florida that's when the when the Mariel boatlift happened in Nineteen eighty we saw all of these people from Fidel Castro's prisons heading north to Miami we detain than we put them in the ... detention center because we didn't know who the word turned out there are a lot of bad people that that came on the Mariel boatlift some good people too but a lot of bad ones came\nBut political asylum from a place like Cuba made sense political someone from the Soviet Union made sense political asylum from Cuba or from China made sense if you're coming from Honduras and you tell reporters who ask you while you're coming but you're looking for a better job and maybe better schools for your kids that's about political asylum is it more you\nKnow and and and no one fault them for wanting to come to ... part of the nine but you know legally and and we've always been open and welcoming welcoming\nLiza ... are they we shouldn't be giving them asylum should we\nKnow that for ... ... per persecution for religious reasons or I'm ... from criminal activity from\nPolitical persecution and that's not what they're facing I understand America is doing great and it's even doing better because of the president than it ever done before you know but that's still not a reason to break the law and come here illegally and so the president is taking this tough action he's ordering the military to go in and help support\nOur customs and border patrol agents as they defend our border but he's going to be very strong in this matter in that we're going to we're going to secure our country we're going to protect Americans\n'cause it's not just about immigration about drug slowly again it's about lower wages for those who are already struggling to climb off the lower rungs of of the of the economic ladder right all of these things matter we can do it but people have got to come out and vote to do it\nHe's at M. A. R. C. underscore ... or the former press secretary for vice president Mike Pence\nUh when when it comes to these bombs that are being sent around or what looked like bomb him even really know what the story ... ... they're still investigating it it's very early use investigation thank God nobody was hurt thank God none of them are detonated and maybe we can go all sorts of information off of these packages and so on\nWhat do you make its mark I know that you deplore this happening I don't want anybody sending bombs and either you don't need as the president or the vice president\nBut ... that's a that's a given for more people\nBut what do you make of the media actually I saw a headline today that said um bombs soon to Trump opponents I mean they're they're making this all about the president as if he's got an even to say about it I don't remember anybody saying rock Obama or Hillary Clinton simply got to go shoot up that baseball practice so what's the story here how do they get away with this\nWell and they control and write their own narrative and and I'll tell you in and you're absolutely right I was with the vice president yesterday with the story was break you know he immediately got in touch with the White House to get the latest information and went and talked about it can damned those actions as the president has done as well and\nMake sure that the full resources of the of the federal government are activated maple to help in the ...\nBut what the media some in the media have done I Believe is ill rough it ill informed too irresponsible because we have seen violence Steve ... was shot\nIn nearly died you know I don't see the outrage when Donald Trump junior and Eric Trump and their families were exposed to threats that came through the mail what about Susan Collins who had death threats and Chuck Grassley who had death threats\nThey did not call out that in nearly as much term and if this person we don't know what their motivation was right but I don't care their politics or their profession\nYou do it you're going to get caught and you're going to have the full weight of the justice system brought down on you as a I don't care who you are right by what we cannot have is people assigning blame and trying to score political points on it before we even know anything about this suspect\nBut it's actually disgusting and this is from a political or hey you may want to be able to disenfranchise or actually ... the right Republicans conservatives even center right people in center left people who are going to vote for him for Republicans or conservatives they need to do whatever they can\nAh Reuben reporting to make us not go out and that's why I think that we have to keep on telling your story the tax cuts and so on ... about that let me just ask you very quickly I got Kevin Brady tomorrow the house ways and Means Committee chair he's a great guy from the Houston or even a woman's\nI'm In Texas we go way back and I love how he how he formed a tax cuts the first time around\nMark I pay attention and stuff I didn't realize until recently there is a tax cuts to point do bench still is yet to be put into place that's really in jeopardy if the midterm should go the wrong way I'm Talking about the economy talking about the injured it's become the steamboats gain and what more tax cuts especially for middle class families will mean\nAbsolutely the first cut rather tax cuts and we did cut taxes at every level it's like the president promised but there was also considerable tax cuts to unlock the potential of our economy right was the corporate tax rate and some of how we tax a corporate earnings that really has what\nIs unleashing the power of the economy getting businesses to invest\nThat really is what is unleashing the power of the economy getting businesses to invest hire people give raises bonuses all of those things are great that cuts to point out the president not only wants to make the individual tax cuts permanent that have already been passed\nBut he also wants to given a given extra incentive for those middle class families who are working every day to pay to pay their bills their mortgage put their kids through college and school those things that many of us worry about living paycheck to paycheck\nThat's the one he wants to really focus in on and we already know that if the Democrats take over they want to undo tax cuts they don't want to do another round they may not even want to make the current ones permanent\nThere'll be ... to get rid of him they wanted to market as a guy who's been campaigning for a long time in a you know how this works\nCould you ever see being in a campaign room and and and somebody shouting out hey I've got an idea on how we could win let's take money out of their paychecks that'll be a winning how does it work who is the brainchild of the left or maybe they shouldn't stop because it's going to be winning combination for us but who was the brainchild it bought\nTaking away the tax cuts that extra money your paycheck your four oh one K. going up your company how many more money to pay you\nWho thought that was a good idea I don't get it\nI have no idea but they've actually even just tried to get away from that now now it's just all about free stuff and and with their drive to cure socialism with trillions upon trillions of dollars of cost\nAnd when you ask them how they're going to pay for it they looked like a deer in headlights yeah ah it's so it's really just such basically fiscal irresponsibility coming from the far left in the show is\nThat it doesn't even warrant than a you know an academic discussion 'cause there's nothing behind those thoughts\nBut again as I look out there I saw it yesterday I've seen it on the campaign trail so many times\nThere are a lot of energy out there I think it's translating into the polls that's going to translate into the into the election results on Tuesday and\nEverybody who's lifting from Michigan to Texas Indiana and beyond your vote is going to count don't vote alone bringing for ... and do whatever you can get to the bowl\nThat last quick question quick answer if you don't mind my over exaggerating when I say if the left or to get the house and or the Senate the economic boom we're seeing right now would stop\nOr I wouldn't I Would definitely put a dent into it I'm not going to stop because remember I I don't think they're going to win the Senate or only be able to get the house yeah but they could they could let taxes expire or they could try to hold the government hostage for some other crazy ideas in budget bills and things were going to have to get everybody to agree\nSo let's not take the chance of now\nEven entertain that thought okay I Do not

I don't remember even doing any of these sort of rallies where he would show up in five ten fifty thousand people would be there he did do it from the White House where he did it from you know which ranch in and he would do the media there their piece every day um did you use that exponentially different to did Reagan do a lot of his campaigning like Trump is doing\nWell during the campaign years has Nineteen eighty floors reelect just like his national election campaign of poison ... campaign events no doubt about it but there again where I think Trump spin very inventor\nHe's has actually said well okay with the old rules he's never stopped campaigning for my mom when he announced today that resume and I don't think he's ever going to stop it in a way that Donald Trump looks like it if you want to lean reelection\nYou better campaign from the White House for from wherever you are every day a week\nAnd if you want to tell your own praises accomplishment you have to do it this way you know that's the beauty of cameras will be trained on him but he knows in a press conference in and I'm actually asking the question you're I'm guessing he knows in a press conference he won't necessarily be able to tell his own praises is that what's happening\nI actually saw a you know I think he's figure it out it's not against the law that campaign and\nYou know so he's just inventing a whole new way to you know to put himself in front of the American people I I I don't I you know I ... I think whether I'm sure there are styles in the future for different presidents won't be radically different they're probably going to pick right up words prop left off because a lot of what he does actually works\nWell what's interesting is John ... she's the executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation and Institute\nWhat's interesting to watch is thirty thirty five\nYears later Ronald Reagan is praised by both sides and the media doesn't necessarily ever say anything negative about\nThis guy I don't think a hundred years from nobody's going to say you've been good about them so it it's almost like a Reagan you don't walk slowly carrying a big stick and had a big smile whereas Trump just gets in your face is that in in your opinion is that'd be the stark difference between the two because when you look at accomplishments\nLike you said they're almost exactly the same\nYeah it's a it's a fascinating question you opposed because I I think\nAbout that every day I Trump is not such a bright white light that are that the relationship so intense that I too cannot imagine twenty thirty forty years from now somehow\nThat dates media looking back you know it was it dear my tours are tourists Donald Trump threatened at the national but also say\nDuring the Reagan taste you never thought it would have been unimaginable either a you know or they may not have that as as ... as intensely war with each other not not at all\nBut Reagan was the target of the liberal press every day he was an office there is no doubt about it and it's only really because of his remarkable successes but as you look back and when his\nFacts are facts are stubborn things and and people not look at the Reagan presidency and they have to give it a ... you know\nWhat side of the fence that you might be on\nGuard reviews John Hi Bush executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential foundation Institute\nI'm I Wonder if you have an opinion on this and unlimited bodies ask you this before but what was Ronald Reagan's um relationship with the media going in Donald Trump for forty years was a media darling in New York LA Washington everywhere\nThey loved him because he meant money they put him on people watch the show and they put him on people would advertise on the show this yeah this relationship went downhill in a matter of three years that's all we're talking about here\nThree years ago right before he announced he was still let me do you darling which Ronald Reagan in good with the media before he ran or ... I I get the feeling that he was\nHe was actually wasn't it was really hot yeah yeah you know I mean you got to remember Reagan started off as an outsider even with his own party they everyone many many thought he was way too far to the right so but at the end you have to remember to one week before\nReagan's first election he was down to Jimmy Carter by ten points you know it was nicer that he would win\nAnd when he came to office the press you know if he was the enemy of guns he was you know right wing not\nEverybody at one of my time for that type of bombs headline everywhere right\nAbsolutely and that you know they make fun of writing and saying I can only speak if he was speaking off of three by five car and you know it wasn't smart he wasn't well read it was that was absolutely not the truth and I think as Reagan continue to perform\nIn like Trump succeed and achieve his goals are they they ... they had to change their mind about Reagan I think by the time he got into a second term\nThey started understanding what they had the front of them already saw reading him for a success was but it really did take you know you know darn near or one or two presidencies before the press really started ... Congress\nIt's kind of amazing or a last question I appreciate the time John I'm ... how does how does Trump either a repair this relationship where do you see them going forward just doing exactly which weren't so far because frankly the media might say that he's a failure these horrible news or something ... and if something is but the bottom line is\nThese crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see him doing going forward\nAnd if we use the word repair I don't think it's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that it's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if I Want to walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing Hollington press is not going to happen uh and and that's because it's interesting it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but but now that the media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah that's a very different thing I don't think\nThe media I think they've kind of a a you know that that kind of bought Trump's line now and and now they're they're they're in an enemy can't win against him no matter what I don't think there's a truth that's on the horizon ever and I think that's going to be the case and so the\nPill Trump like Reagan did hops aboard Murray one and slides a circle around the city I was here I I just don't see it happen\nI think you're absolutely ... percent right and oh by the way Trump said recently that he could nominate Hillary Clinton for the Supreme Court in the media still wouldn't like it John we are usually\nAnd we've that he could nominate Hillary Clinton but as a Marine Corps to the media still wouldn't like it John we are usually the information and the access let's do it again so moving back you great to be with John Hi Bush the executive director the Ronald Reagan presidential ... we appreciate your back after this on the Joe ...\nShow fall down [noise]\n\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well complicated especially as the weather it begins to cool well one person sleep soundly the other is either freezing or way too hot boiling branch makers of the world's most comfortable sheets loved by three us presidents is offering luxury flannel betting for a limited time and bowling branch dot com\nThey're unbelievably solved warm and breathe the bowl so everyone stays the right temperature the flannel sheets coming forging studying patterns and colors you're guaranteed to find a style you love\nPlus you could try them for thirty nights risk free but whatever you do don't wait last year there flannel sheets sold out just a few weeks so go bowling Braves dot com today for fifty dollars off your first set of ...\nPlus free shipping with robo code ...\nDollars off plus free shipping right now at bowling branch dot com used my code\nTags P.
