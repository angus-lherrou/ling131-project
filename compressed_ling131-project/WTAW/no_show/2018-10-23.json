whether they were going to be released or not released and wait for their term time to go before the court\nOr it was not a baby jail bill who was a protection bill those were people who were coming

that question but\nIt was to help\nAnd protect those people it really is the general still operates the mind signing the bill did was give the state the right to go in and make sure those children and people were really taking care of in a legitimate way that was all it really did\nIt didn't do anything else the jail still is there because of the federal government and I was trying to make sure

statements first Timothy ...\nUniverse first I Want to think before I Want to thank you for this opportunity for voters to engage the representatives and I want to thank you for showing up here tonight and for clicking in my name is Timothy Douglas on go on the Republican nominee for best kind of commissioner precinct for I'm running for office because I Believe we need a strong voice at the table\nOf some of the challenges facing precinct for is we need to manage to growth it's coming to our precinct I I Believe that we need to invest in school safety and I think our county property taxes are too high\nNow the ... campus is going to be increasing for and that's going to be phenomenal growth coming to our precinct that's a blessing and it's also a challenge\nThe decisions that we're making today are going to affect our community for decades we want to welcome the new people coming into our precinct that are going to be coming down the road was court or but we also want to protect the lifestyles of the people who currently live here that's my focus that's where I'm running for county commissioner\nAnd uh I appreciate it thinking\nComments of Timothy Dell a sun Rhone now the opening comments over McCauley\nHowdy for nine years I have served as your county commissioner precinct for and I hadn't been honored to serve you most of the you know\nUm my office and what it is that I Do you know me from the work and the community and leadership that I share with you before I was a county commissioner\nDoug county commissioners or\nA ... to local government in that it is the conditioners court that um\nAll right well that's but again that is not the charges county commissioner snow removal part it's gonna it's not but says he brought it up I think it's important to around ... heart valves time to ask your\nOpponent or questions so it was called you have a question for Mr ...\nLike to know how Mr does Sondra\nWould um fun the safety program in in the schools he's mentioned\nAgain there's money coming in relatives exploding ... going to be money coming in I'm not only do I think we can find that I think we can find the tax cuts um uh when you look at property taxes because this is important you\nHave a homestead exemption covers or city taxes and it covers a school board taxes but it does not cover your county taxes the counting it's allowed by state law to shut up to twenty percent of the value of your home under the homestead exemption as shields none I think we should expand the homestead exemption to cover a property to cover hum\nA county taxes and and that's the way that we can shield some of the high cost of our taxes going up your over here\nBut we can do that and we can make important decisions in our infrastructure and important decisions about where we're going to grow and I just I got to tell you I think school safety is an essential service I expect the Columbine happened and it's not going away our kids are a threat and we don't know where those threats are coming from and that that addressed that threat assessment is always there\nAnd so spending the money on school safety to me that's a no brainer\nOkay but I have to ask you if you're saying now shield and we also need to come up with this million dollar someplace and don't those to work at odds with one another\nNo the taxes are twenty five million dollars a year over year this year and that's the kind of an accounting thing that's not outright average it's five million more in as well as comes in you should expect to see that seven or eight million more we do have some discretionary spending to do the things that are necessary for what\nWhat are the heart of really use federal dollars four or five times what part of ... going to increase the taxes\nAre well developed campus will be shielded but you've got to understand how we forty seven and hide Twenty one are going to explode and grow you're going to have businesses come in and have apartment complex was coming and going to have a housing incidence come in all that stuff is prime to explode over the next two years\nAnd and this is an important point the planning that we make today is going to affect our our precinct for decades and so it's very important but planning goes into that today well one of his one of my biggest concerns is as we come down highway Twenty one\nI'm you look ten Twenty years down the road justification is going to move some of the people who live there out of their homes and we've got to make sure that we protect\nThose ... where it's not even [laughter] it's not even part of the bride city limits yet so there is a long way to go before that but I I've got to move on okay so now your opportunity to ask 'em is called a question\nGot ... voted to make April Confederate history and heritage month seven times this year when you have an opponent wasn't on the ballot this year if you were reelected is it going to be on the docket next April and if so how are we report\nYou were reelected is it going to be on the docket next April and if so how are we report\nI wouldn't know if it's gonna be on the ballot because I don't I'm pretend

open mind as my door is always open my mind is open to a diversity\nI respect that when I came to the board or to the commissioner\n\nTime's up okay [laughter] so I looked out from it it's definitely been comments you could you could pick it up right there if you want okay\nUm again my name is I'm a collie I'm your breath it's county commissioner\nAnd I realize I'm In my position serving ... for Republicans and being the only Democrat I bring up a bit of diversity I'm the only black female I'm and\nI'm not in timid dated by that at all I think that in fact that we have diversity were able to

Republican nominee for president county commissioner precinct or book there's a lot of changes come into bracing for and we need to plan for those changes today because we don't plant correctly for those changes today then it's going to negatively affect us for decades to come\nThe bottom line is this I'm all for growth I mean it's going to happen rather importer not relative campuses coming in I was Twenty one highway forty sevens going to a completely different and two three four years\nWell my concern is used to make sure that we protect not not just the people coming in and making sure that they can participate in the quality of life that we have her in Brussels county but do we protect the quality of life for the people who are here now that spoke the county residents we want to make sure that we protect their private property rights and it's also for our city residents and we want to make sure as as relatives coming in and expanding its not pushing our\nI'm old older neighborhoods out that we protect the rights of the people who were there now\nAnd so I I Want to be a strong advocate for our neighborhoods in precinct for and to protect our quality of life both for the people here and for the people who are common thank you very much\nHere are candidates for county commissioner precinct for thank you [noise]\n\nWhen it comes to my money I like to keep things simple that's why I have a prosperity simply free checking account free no one's going to beat that price and there's no monthly maintenance the no individual checked fees unlimited withdrawals free debit card free online banking\nProsperity is the big bank with your community spank inside\nRefined real bankers nachos to bank prosperity bank USAID dot com member FDIC one hundred dollar minimum deposit job and account\nProducers Saturday classes are back in session and the accent or by the fireplace each week from tend to eleven AM experts will cover a variety of topics were the ...\nProducer and the home gardeners producers Saturday glasses their educational and they're free this Saturday October twenty seven wonder about a new line product for ... judgment traditionally tons of agricultural line were applied in past years with trucks but now a new product technology\nHas provided a viable option these details will be discussed this weekend producers producers on Texas avenue and Brian just north\nOf Twenty one I'm saying Taylor with the impulse maniacs of eating cats are talking about yard animals this morning well here's what you mess\nBut more and more there are there people who keep your chicken writer but the thing is they're not pets they're basically there to do work\nFor their home in my neighborhood and they have something that looks like a chicken coop in their backyard and I thought that they were keeping chickens back there you have peaked overweight ... keeping their cat in a oh wow like a cat how really I mean but it can get in and out what he wants to know really\nSo that that is stuck there that as an angry cat yeah that would be an angry I I'm pretty sure because I saw the woman like going in it one day to feed the ... ... ... is it a tax on I ...

evening\nI Want to thank the chamber and all of the organizers forehead thing this form tonight my name is Amanda Green and I am running for a place to on the College Station eyes the school board because of my true lab for this distract and what it has given to my family [noise]\nAnd I believe what the board tried to do on when putting this policy in place as to put a deterrent\nAnd did it go far enough\nI wasn't sitting in that seat I wasn't looking at that data but what I can tell you that any new policy that utilizes on an expenditure that we are taking away from teachers or resources in the classroom definitely needs to we need to evaluate its effectiveness at the one year mark\nLike your comments were made a great put thirty seconds on the clock for pleased about miscreants stay with you to help poor poor students pay for referral treatment if they test positive\nI'm Sorry you took a drink or to go ahead [laughter] you're sure the question is how will poor students pay for referral treatment if they test positive right\nSo that was actually one of the questions that I had a when this policy came out\nAnd what I Will tell you is that we do need to have a we we should be implementing a more comprehensive policy if someone does test positive where what referral where do we send that that is a big issue that faces our district\nI Will tell you that the funding um it comes to us from the Texas Legislature we are going to have to work very closely with our state representatives to understand for them to understand the needs and mental health services as well as drug and alcohol counseling and needs to be addressed\nCarl Bernstein question for you\nWell there's a couple of things that happened in that process first and foremost when you test positive under a randomized student drug testing these the school district is responsible for making sure that there's follow what services\nPart of that process falls up under their normal insurance pieces and falls up under an obligation of the school to ensure that if you identify a child but you don't leave them I'm without resource or without help\nSo that's the one thing that we talk about what I Would rather do is instead of putting that money into randomized soon drug testing is go back to actually putting in a school a health advisory committee\nThat charges Medicaid so that we have those services available for kids we know who have that problem\nIt'll stay with you Mr buried during the the upper a superintendent and the central office or are they effective leaders as far as you're concerned\nWell there are a couple of things that I look at when I look at leadership and that's either across the country or when I'm dealing with my own children at the school campus um we have to first and foremost understand that the superintendent as a political animal he has to make sure that there are four people in that school board that appreciate his services\nUm after working with many school districts and many superintendents one of the things that I Would say that we need to work on with our current one has to make sure that he is an advocate and kind of is in some degree being able to chart a course for our district\nWhen I see a lot of cases is that we have a lot of data but it's not always well used we have a significant problem in our district with a number of students who are failing to achieve academically and those are particularly our children of color\nAnd so one of the things that we have to do is continue to make sure that we focus on that and I see some emphasis but I don't see the work that I Would expect to come from my superintendent\nWe had seven hundred new kids identified is at risk of educational failure in the last two years yet I don't hear that being talked about and I guarantee you if I'm On the school board we're going to be addressing those issues torture every child in this district gets a quality education\nAnd a degree in the same question for you\nYes I Believe that specifically that our superintendent and our leadership or doing an excellent job in our district and I'll tell you why\nUm they have implemented they've gone above and beyond the state standards to make sure that our children and our district is evaluated with a community based accountability program that is being watched and mirrored in other districts we are one of the ... districts in the state of Texas and definitely a premiere\nOn public school option in this area\nI think that they're doing an excellent job I think that they hire excellent teachers or they're always on there always room for improvement absolutely but that's why we have the school board to help bring diverse ideas\nUm to our our district and evaluate them hold them accountable but I Will tell you based on the community case about ... system that our district has put forth based on the legislative priorities that I have seen our district to vote on and the last school board meeting they are doing an excellent job representing ...\nDegree it'll it'll stay with you or when it comes to attendance zones at what point should citizen input be a part of the equation\nSo that's an excellent question and I believe that citizen input is an extremely important part of the tendons and boundary I'm drawing on one of the issues that I have heard from constituents in the district is\nThat it's not consistent so when we do have to go and redraw they do put out maps um for our um our parents to absorb learn ask questions they may hold a foreign they may not um I Believe that we need to bring in some consistency\nAny time we do make a decision that's going to impact where someone goes to school or a program that we put that out to the community and a very specific time frame that it's predictable we hold forums at times that are convenient for our parents to attend\nAnd any time if there is a major redraw consideration that we put that back out to our community so that they have time to absorb it\n... the same question for you to bury too\nStrict or that is going to result in each child or without parental input is that simple so one of the things that we've already talked about is the revision of the AFC local policy and that would put in something we're already doing something that is already known nationally to be effective and that would be\nAnd that would put in something we're already doing something that is already known nationally to be effective and that would be a campus based committee\nJust like we do with head start and it's a requirement of some of the federal regulations 'cause it's shown to impacts do uh parents and to get them involved in school and also into the school board is to ensure that those campus committees are comprised of not teachers and not administrators but actually voted on by members of each campus to have representation that\nCommittee then would look over the individual concerns are that are resorting decision at the campus level\nAnd if we need to do a bone I a boundary and zoning committee above that we would elect members out of each of those individual campuses to make sure that every school has a voice\nIn our schools that have split you would send two representatives from the campus so that there is never a situation in our community going Ford F ... an accident circumstance or parental input is not available or accepted\nYou mean thirty seconds on the clock and dental stay with you whenever you put in Paris levels but says to me you don't think the school board is competent to be able to handle the information that's been given to\nUs got nothing to do with confidence has got to do with common sense if I have a child I don't need some people who I don't personally know tell me where my child is going to go without at least giving me the him a chance to have that input ethic campus level and build it up\nThose forums if you ever go back and look at the eagle I've been on them and I've talked to a at links that each one of them but we have to have that understanding of what's happening in the campus in to the campus with each one of those individual boundary decisions\nThan it should not be up to seven members to decide where my child goes without my voice\nOkay material gets you in a minute but let's say that you have a campus committee and the campus committee says we don't like to play in the school board's supposed to do\nWhat you have a Eighteen next year you're going to have Nineteen of those individual campuses are going to be able to represent those on the boundaries owning committees\nYou're not going to have everybody who is going to like it but as one of the things we do know is\nThat you want to add more voice when you're dealing with kids children and the impact that those are decisions have on your family and where your child is going it may not be always accepted but the better communication between the community in the school board\nThe better the district will be it has proven across this country and in our own community but you're not miss green your opportunity\nSo having actually served on a resenting committee and CSI see I can tell you that the school board and the superintendent do a very good job of setting the parameters when you walk in the door you leave your biased behind and if you can't then you were not asked to serve\nTheir they get certain parameters on proximity comparable composition and all of the data from that day that that is where that community wide and are resenting committee based with parents teachers principals staff\nAll come together to look what's best for the district and make their recommendations the school board doesn't have to listen to those recommendations\nAnd all of the reasoning that I have either been a part of or have attended they had that had to use that this community um and put them in committees have utilized on the recommendations made for you know from that committee\nYour comparable composition is a key factor of the district Houston boundary adjustment and re zoning decisions what changes if any would you make to the zoning linked to comparable composition so in other words the school's pretty much school student body is pretty much look alike start with you ms ...\nAbsolutely so my focus would be on the students understanding the student's needs and meeting them at their level to foster success can bearable composition as discussed in the context of boundary adjustments\nHas been primarily focused at the school level in our district the gold being reduced the disparity and across the schools and the numbers now while I Am one hundred percent I'm In support of comparable composition as a factor in resigning I'd like to see this taken to a deeper level\nTo focus more directly on the economically disadvantaged students what I'm hearing from many and the community as I Walk the streets\nAs that particularly let those that are in the community that's defined as economically disadvantaged is that they would like greater engagement and less ... less assumptions are present in being made about their unique situation\nI while comparable composition I Will tell you is important understanding the barriers to students' success is equally as important\nGood evening thank you to the chamber for having us this evening my name is ... and I'm running for College Station city council place for\nCollege Station is a growing and diverse community and I believe it would be best served by council member who has an array of experience and who can tackle them for a variety of issues that it faces\nProfessionally I have knowledge and experience and both the business world and as government employment\nPersonally community service has been an important facet of my life\nFrom the various sports that I serve on to the uh community programs that I've participated in each has given me insight to every aspect of our community that along with my service on the planning and zoning commission for the past two years is why\nAlong with my service on the planning and zoning commission for the past two years is why I Believe that I Am the candidate who could fetched represent all of our citizens thinking\nNow the opening comments of job you're\nGood evening my name is Joe Gary I'm running for city council for the city uh College Station I'm a fourth generation Texan born and raised in Corpus Christi Texas I've been married to my wife for Twenty one years you have two daughters and at one stepson\nI'm a transportation planner by trade and almost Thirty years of transportation planning engineering and design experience or Tim ... five with the city College Station interested in the private sector working for transportation engineering consultants [noise]\nI'm a certified city planners to the American Institute of certified planners I'm also a certified professional transportation planner through the Institute of transportation engineers\nMy platform is for smart responsible wrote for neighborhood in jeopardy and for fiscal responsibility thinking\nAll right let's get started right there with new faces come new ideas let's expand a little bit on your ideas if the Guerra\nCould you repeat the question\nWas new faces come new ideas you have some new ideas that you'd like to bring the city council\nSure um first of all\nTwo thousand nine we ah completed our two dozen a comprehensive plan and so it's been ten years since we've last worked on or does a comprehensive plan so this year we're going to work on a comprehensive plan a part of the country as a plan\nA is master plan such as you want to waste water treatment water waste water master plan and use a surfer plant 'em and it sets the stage and how the city is going to grow a it says this age on ah what type of growth and what type of land use is we're going to have\nIs also set a sits to say it sets the stage under densities that we're going to propose\nAnd densities are very important because of the mortgage the more traffic you have the more dads the more water waste water you use and so we can actually sit those densities are ended press room over to our ah Sony and ordinances codified\nThank you very much Muslim solving some question\nAh what I Would like to bring to the city council um I Would hope is not a new idea but um would continue to push for a efficient governance\nA we have for example over two hundred acres of land in the spring creek area and that we have had for over a dozen of years\nAnd so I Would like to see continued focus on by our economic development\nDepartment to a move that land back onto the tax rooms and something that we could see a developed there could possibly use would be the concept of the tours are right now we do have one tours in the documents area\nUm but I think the tourists that would be worth considering for the spring precarious so\nStay with you know some people say that growth should pay for itself with recent edition of water and waste water impact sees a roadway impact the\nHow do you encourage plus tax increases how do you encourage development in College Station without pushing those would be companies to the county or Brian because of the developing cost in\nCollege Station that's a very good question um the market is difficult enough at it as it is and I think we run into issues when we negatively affect that market with the addition of the impact fees\nUm we have some of our in fact she's are newly instituted so we'll see how many we can actually collect but I think to counter that we need to provide a applicants for businesses with a\nStreamlined process and what I mean streamlined I mean a process of compromise where they feel that they can identify locations and visualize their product to within a reasonable amount of time\nAnd we also need to in general provide a market where they feel that their employees can live and stay and that includes affordable housing which unfortunately has also affected by our impact if he's\nGot to me just follow up real quickly would you be in favor of giving them some sort of abatement on an impact fees if they're large enough\n[noise] ah I don't know if I Would be in favor of a bait meant that I think we need to continue to monitor the progress and the effect on the efficiency of the impact fees because um another thing that we need to consider is that a lot of these seeds are hidden\nQuote unquote and are passed on to the taxpayer and unlike the taxes and cannot be tested on your federal revenue so\nIn fact we are taxing again our citizens through these these\nSort of the same question for you drove era some people say that grows should pay for itself of the reason edition watering wastewater impact season roadway impact these how can you encourage development in College Station without pushing it out into the county or to Brian\nI'm first of all I Would not uh give out tax abatements a\nWe have grown so fast the city has to provide services or you can't tax year citizens year after year after year or to provide those services such as water waste water or transportation\nAnd so a roadway impact fees and waterways watery impact these kind of levels the playing field\nOr some of the reasons that development won't go to Brian is because we have a great school system so they wanted to be the city of causation because our school system\nWhether reason to stay well I go to the counties the county subdivision regulations are prohibited except abiding land smaller than an acre and so it's not profitable to a a built subdivision in the county right I'll stay with you [noise]\nTransportation is a concern in the city we haven't had to worry about the central at five thirty last tonight and every night we get on the road so with that there are numerous roads that need to be built or expanded and places where that congestion needs to be reducing the future interstate fourteen Yankee highway will be built possibility of high speed rail\nWith all that what is your vision of addressing transportation issues within the city of College Station joke here\nI think to the adoption of the army was was a good step a I have my own ideas or my job that's me travel throughout the state and so I can see what other municipalities and counties are doing I liked what Williamson county in ... county are doing\nOr what they've done is they've raised their match on tech start projects normally your matches eight or ten percent\nFor state funded projects or twenty percent for a federal a project\nWhich and county ... county have done if they they've gone beyond fifty percent and then they negotiated with tech start to see how much fixed up pays them back [noise]\nHowever they tax their citizens in order to pay off bonds to do that I Would rather use tests and terrorists to pay off any bonds that we would use to ... to up our match up with ...\nMissile solve these same question for you\nI think this question um demonstrates the need to work with our regional partners and why we need to have strong relationships and with not only Brian\nYou know partners and why we need to have strong relationships um with not only Brian but also the county and the university is they impact our traffic as well it is a College Station issue but the cars and do not stop\nAt the city line the army is a good example of that collaborative process and I look forward to seeing continuing prince of\nProgress so that we can hopefully\nTackle some projects I also think we need to be a little bit forward looking I Know the issue of mass transit is often brought up there are cities who are now a testing with companies\nThat are using the ride sharing concept in mass transit and I think that's more the idea of the future and I would like to see us going that direction as well\nOr are they gonna give you about thirty seconds to expand a little bit more on roads share or mass transit\nSo from what I've seen it it is off of the same concept as liberal list would be more of of not just the car sized bed event sized type of transportation where the user would have an app and through the ap the company develops routes and people can then\nThrough the app pick their routes or find locations where they can pick up that ride sharing\nThis would be a company that the city would contract with rather than the city itself\nNot necessarily contract with that I think that we can look into those options and attract that type of business just like we're always trying to attract businesses to the city\nFor ... I'll give you thirty seconds to to speak to the idea of mass transit Roger\nAny system that takes the single single occupant\nTogether or specifically on transportation issues\nOn programming they're prioritizing projects that would spend federal and state funds\nAre so I did it as a staff member and as I recall we also had joint meetings with the the uh Brian planning and zoning commission I Believe that we're quarterly or so so both a pie in the commissioners were there in both staff from both cities where there\nAre mainly to see how are both cities were growing what were the issues and how we can work together on those issues\nOkay let me throw thirty seconds they'll just come back to you should the planning and zoning commission so the two cities meat and how often\nI think quarterly is is is a good enough as I recall or if you met too soon there weren't that many issues that would have come up for you to discuss his quarterly I think is is a good ah\nAverage time or you work through the issues that came up in the previous meeting and then some issues with a trickle up and you could work thrown on those in the next ... or or eat in your unit\nYou same question for you miss ... showed the planning and zoning commissions are these two cities meat and how often\nI I think it would be wonderful if they met how often um ideally quarterly or at least twice a year however uh we've already been trying to coordinate that so coordinating between the two cities all the commissioners and their staff is often unfortunately an issue\nFor me stop you how can that be differ how can that be so difficult to do well because\nEach commissioner has their own job we are serving the community and actually have to set our time aside to come and serve on the commission so between our own\nPersonal at um schedules and then the schedule is a staff as well and you have seven and seven on both sides and then plus the staffers that's what renders that difficult sometimes for what I was going to add to that is that we are soon having a presentation college station is\nFrom Brian staff ah regarding feedback on their overlay so we do have communication and request for information between the two cities\nThey gotta look good if he lived between planning and zoning commissions are get together that's for sure listening closing comment so first you moved here\n\nFirst of all I wanted a bank or the or the chamber of commerce for putting this event uh and invited me to speak ... my a platform for smart responsible growth for neighborhood integrity and for fiscal responsibility\nTo the most important investment decisions of family will ever make is one\nTo raise kids would have kids and raise kids to to purchase a home and put a roof over their heads so those are the two most important investment decision to finally will ever made and so we need to protect those investments we need to protect our neighborhoods so that our families can ah\nCan thrive in these neighborhoods they need to be safe in it and they need to be peaceful\nIt's so if that resonates with you I ask you joined me join my campaign worked for a job era so we can keep College Station a great place to live in a great place to raise a family I think you\nKnow the closing comment civilian will result in\nStation is that a critical time in our history and that means with the growth that we're having we must work to ensure a high are high\nAnd that means with the growth that we're having we must work to ensure our ... our high quality of life\nAlong with ensuring a strong local economy\nUm that balance requires a someone with a varied experience to make the difficult decisions that ensures that all of our core services and needs are met and that includes police fire infrastructure transportation\nI'm as a former teacher attorney and current business manager I Believe that I bring that experience to the council\nUm I also bring a experience with our community partners which as we've already discussed is um\nAn important in the future at planning of our region in our city and so for those reasons I ask for your vote this November vote Eleanor of uh Solly

residents I painted houses to put myself through college\nAnd during graduate school I decided that I make a better painter that an English teacher and I'm sure there are a lot of students out there that would be grateful for that decision I I've been married forty five years for Francis ... who has a a masters in early childhood education which explains why she's able to stay married to meet so long\nTo use as is frugal\nA thought process as they can so that we don't have a lot of waste that we don't have that the citizens deserve it and and I and I again uh I've I've done that for Thirty years uh and and been able to make a living and put a kid through I Am reminded me that Obama came in right once and went home site so\nYou know [noise]\nSounded ask a question of one of your opponents was tuna have a question\nFor either of the other question Muslim So my question is one of my pot farms is all I think we should be consistently who are you asking the question like you know oh All right well then I'm Mr Maloney than as my neighbor\nAnd so what am I platforms pieces is that we consistently recognize the positive things that are happening in College Station so what are the things he seemed like a going right where where are highlights\nA good point ... says the great priceless and and I read a raise both my children here my my ... get bring my grandkids to parks and everything but like I say I like to see more parks\nI like to see uh I like to see us get back to the designation of being a bicycle friendly\nCommunity which were at one time when I was on the transportation committee for the council we were one of only two cities in the entire state that had the ... nation we have to meet certain criteria we have to do that I like to see us get back to the environment that I had\nA back in the eighties and nineties when it when we lived on ... avenue where where it was a mixture very eclectic mix of neighbors we had students that would come by and knock on your door and said look I'm going to have a party or you know if we get too loud his mind no Britain let me know you know and and will clean up after ourselves\nThat's gone we moved out of our house because I was tired of every three o'clock in the morning going over the fence and say look you've got to tell that got to get out of the damned tree okay that guy to start drinking is your good points since yeah all that\nAnd and I like to just get back to that in a barn and and I think we can do that if we start if we empower our neighborhoods with overlays where they can control the character that neighborhood\nMr baloney of a question for the year to ...\nYou know and I met them they're really nice genuine good people they have their heart and the right place and it would be fine addition to the conversation city council or any board that you want so you broke your heart Mr all\nI don't really have a question for them I Do have a comment that I think we're very fortunate in a community to have people not only sitting up here the sitting out there that was all Americans want to do the best job they can for the citizens community\nThey they their conscientious sitting down watching ... council means ah yesterday the was the ... anniversary of sit in College Station I'm the mayor was here I don't know if he still is or not if he's not a what he was looking for somebody to donate a locomotive\nTo put into Carter park so that they could tell people why College Station is called College Station\n[noise] uh so if anybody's gotta locomotives hanging around you'd be happy to take it\n[laughter] um but it would be interesting I don't think we're having is around ... um ... um what\nWould you do to enhance relationship with the city of Brian where two cities in one community what would you do\nOh I Love that question because I have a question that my dining table\nSo I work for College Station I asked the I've been there for fourteen years my husband works for Brian I esteem [noise] ah he's worked there for over a dozen years and we have conversations across the table about the two cities and and the demographics there's similarities their differences\nI liked what the previous at the previous\nRepresentative place for talked about quarterly meetings with the pie and see I think that's wonderful we have a emergency plans\nThat are countywide where we have representatives from the cities come we're called Twin Cities are we really are one community and so as we continue collaborative efforts um I think those are important as we continue casual interactions I think those built incredible bridges\nSo like when when he when we had the uh buffalo run out at the ... center\nPeople from both communities where mingling casually together and those bridges are important when you start to talk about ah places the friction they keep things a conversational and so I I was in the amphitheater we there we invite them to come\nSo I can read much even just roll same question for you to cities one community how do you make that happen\nWell with with my business being\nAt one time in College Station and another time being Bryan I've had the opportunity to meet both both citizens\nUh I think it's just the taking the time to enter integrate with each other on a very close relationship of trying to accomplish similar goals and tasks quite honestly\nObvious difference between downtown Brian and north gate so it's going to be difficult to have a conversation on that but to talk about other issues of zoning ordinances are overlays or taxation those are the topics that can be discussed and then maybe we can find a common ground\nThe the ... the harmony that we have with a and M. and the medical district that's that's a good sign that's a very positive sign and what can be done when people get together and talk about something as is common interests and has set a goal to make it happen\nSame question for your Dennis Miller\nOkay well I I've been painting houses here for Nineteen forty eight the city of Brian uh the family's Brian family that one of my customers are so I Know a lot about Brian a Dr King's house I mean you name it I met anyone out here within three friends of yours you're going to know that I was a painter\nSo I Know a lot about the city I Know a lot about the history my wife has a ... a retired Brian independent school or a district teacher she's a kindergarten teacher again why we're happily married for forty five years\nAnd uh when I was on the council and I don't know why they stop this we used to have a two representatives from from College Station city council and two representatives from Brian\nAnd uh that we get together and we would have a joint meetings just the way we did with the independent school district for College Station I was on that committee as well we wouldn't be a I Know that could was every\nAnd that is well we wouldn't be a I Know that can was every three months or something like that but it was good to get out there and talk to one another and see what are you guys concerned about what how can we help one another where the ways of working together by the way we have over twenty or thirty inter governmental or contract between the two cities we get along pretty well\nAll right well and let's go by thirty seconds this Qunu we talked about planning and zoning commissions meeting together\nBrian is apparently going to make a presentation the College Station and that is earth shattering cars that hasn't happened [noise] so what do we do to get these cities together to meet regularly so that we're all headed in the same direction thirty seconds give me a thought\nWell I think on this money's ideas sending to both directions is a great idea I think having ... quarterly together is a great idea I think having a social interactions where we can just talk casually as one another is is a great idea\nI don't think the divide is really that distinct and I think I think we're fairly integrated often I've heard as I've attended city council meetings from the passenger side at the council says oh well this is what they did and Brian they're very we're very aware of each other currently\nRunning she said she said oh we are [laughter]\nThere's no distinction between the between the two cities you go right well we'll shop at one another stores we all we all want to know this place and we all tend to want to know the structures and I I mean it's all\nWere were integrated it's just that we have to separate governments and we're we're we have our own set of rules that we live by and they have their own set of rules to live but that's all there is no common ground we met there is common ground it's already here where here I don't I don't I don't see what the problem is I\nSaid there's a problem I'm saying communication between the governmental body is on a regular boy as loud as you well know I'm willing to talk anywhere anytime or anybody sure\n[noise] Mr ... [noise]\nThere are pieces of our community that are very close\nRight now um my son has a firefighter a station six um there's a lot of Brotherhood between\nThe fire department and the police departments and these two communities\nThere's a lot of Brotherhood between business people that share common customers in this community\nA it is something that is just a nice to be nurtured needs to be encouraged a it is one that when when it's done is done right then we will see the positive effects on it uh but I don't think we have a serious issue I just think we need to to be more thoughtful about using it\nFor me to stay with you I'm Around this written down my concern in College Station is deep I'm really concerned about a city that is behind in super fast growth were ultra density in North gate we're about to have it on the Harlem and by the new HEB\nWe're way behind and we've got two hundred million dollars in Prague projects that need to be done as well we don't want to raise taxes will raise impact fees it sounds to me like if you sit on his counsel you do have a full job ahead of you how do you get a hold of this\nOne a lot of those projects that are there are similar to households or you know your household\nNeeds a new paint job or you know or need a new roof or need something you if you have the money at that time you do it if it's something you've got to budget for then you postpone it is still a project out there it's just when you can afford to do do that project and how urgent is a project\nA growing community there's always going to be some capital

much so yeah and\nAnd what have you ever you or have you put like a magnifying glass on these spores on your body to see the I mean what what do you see there\nUm I haven't I don't know how to get a magnifying glass to that degree on my body I just take what comes out of my body and put it under the magnifying glass and that proved to I'm what I've seen through that is it's it\nLooks like something that's building something and I don't know what that something is it [laughter] it almost um gosh I don't know\nHow it sounds a lot like you know there's when he was really odd is there there was actually something that um was reported by Russia or on the space shuttle and he said that it was eating the plastic on the space shuttle when he was eating another fish will be says he was eating parsley coming I assess who's eating the\nThe the plastic windows swimming I assessed and the ... there was something that came from the ocean that's what they're saying within that that's what now says but then there were other Russia had said something like ... there was\nThey called it an extraterrestrial ... or did they didn't know what it was and he said he could have come from the ocean but they were saying no they're investigating is some sort of\nSee an alien and they use the word enough got pissed off right said\nOh you can use a word on this thing but he was a a little uh

Fisher was after you gonna slow anything up in practice\nOr we're going to stay in touch he goes they got they got to keep it fast ball looking will gave that\nThe slow anything up in practice or we're going boss they intend to go stay physical say he got to keep the fastball looking will gave that to where we can judge it by our parents of our players how health that we are in our GPS what our number saying when our species and maybe that's why we use that things\nWere a little bit more from coach fish are coming up also touching on the world series game one tonight in Boston all that more coming up in sports\nSo I understand the president was in Houston apparently yeah them both and apparently some people went to see I I think a few thousand yeah if you felt and I guess they filled up the ... center how how much does that compare to what he normally draws in what I'm Wondering\nLike ... well I think it just depends on the ... well that's true I think he pretty well fills any venue easy and I don't\nKnow how many would be and uh so anyway so here he is talking about the um the caravan of people that are the ones that\nFirst let me talk about that second day event thing is really amazing to me yeah Seventy two hundred people okay is point now look they're estimating there\nIs there is these people apparently are coming here for a refuge right around me they probably don't have a lot of money\nRight yeah ... very little but I mean look at the clothes they've got all under not horrible there and I had I hadn't seen any picture how fix or have they walked right how did they all decided to get I mean is that Central America is where they're coming from okay but it looks like a flash\nMob of how everybody knows they should be at this place right yeah you see what I'm saying\nYeah that they all get together and they were like hey you're going this way why don't we uh mine now they're picking up people as they charge migration\nAnd I just kind of have to believe there's some sort of an underpinning of a framework here yeah I mean I don't know if\nYou think there's a very good either I I really do the bottom of it well\nI mean did they give these people all cell phones so they know how to communicate about where they're supposed to meet\nAll those people show up at the border at the same time on Saturday right I'm right if they're coming from these shouldn't they be wandering in from all sorts of other directions it's just I'm I'm Sorry I just I don't have any answers to\nThat I Know yeah I like this tinfoil hat so I Know [laughter] I think that long ago you know it makes you it I'd never thought about it but it makes perfect sense All right so here's the president on the\nDemocratic Party is openly in charging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws violate our borders and overwhelm our nation that starts out\nHere so the Mexican government you know kind of tried to come up with a way to corral these folks for lack of a better word just to organize moving them in saying do you really want to be here will take you back to whatever your country and some people did did that\nWell now they've been overrun and I had to believe that the United states was helping Mexico with money or whatever yeah to to do that so now Mexico kind of up in the ante a little bit or they want more money is and then they'll stop the caravan from getting here\nBut again this is seven thousand people who are doing something illegal it is against the law and for all those folks who came to America and became American citizens\nLegally right I think they have to be a little bit pissed off about it I I think they are and I think when you're talking about as far as the dream or act and everything else you know is it the kids' fault that they grew up here\nAnd no it they're not and and I don't think anybody is blaming them and everybody believes that you should have a chance to make your own way in America but at the same time when you're starting to implement this and say well if you've gotten away with being here legally long enough\nYou should just go ahead and become a citizen\nI think that's rewarding you know bad behavior and so people are going to think that that's OK\nRight and then with these people coming in and saying oh well we don't care what\nHe has to say he is the leader of our country and you know you can't just\nIgnore what they don't live they don't like to do if they don't like what you're saying then the rules should apply\nYeah well and unfortunately if he truly does have to call on the military and here is\nAn issue that it is it should be it should not be a concern but it is and and and it shouldn't be something that our military has to deal with but unfortunately it seems like they might have to\nI Know I can see\nThe Toyota centered around exactly Iraq I mean they they don't say lock her up and they said Billy oh but\nEverybody sees that as hate ... I Know\nBut here's the deal is the ... the whole idea is to get folks out the vote\nYou don't want that to me for open borders which means cry\nMassive tax cuts they're against law enforcement they're totally against eyes and law enforcement there again share military and they're not ...\nHow do you win on that platform [noise]\nGood questions question if there is one thing that Trump truly has done well ah you know besides saying\nAnd Lloyd's being controversy right well what what I'm saying is he the way that he has gone about treating veterans and jerking his way that I think is definitely put some people behind him because he is definitely pro military he is pro\nYou know as far as helping bats at least in what he says and I think in many of the things that he's done and that's really brought people on his side I think ...\n... not just that I mean I understand that the uh is at LBJ cheese that or is that the writer ... Ali G. T. okay this guy is not negative that group he is not anti that group has not done anything anything at all to say that\nThat you cannot live that that lifestyle\nAnd that's a pretty amazing thing to hear that first of all from Republican but you're hearing it for the president of the United states and those folks want to if they want to be critical of him they're not listening to what he's saying they're not\nListening to what he had because Trump isn't that much that well that's right and people don't realize that hey lot a lot of folks wanted to vote yesterday in ... county thirty seven hundred and fifty six people wiling to the Brezhnev county election administration now you take that\nAnd expanded across the state I mean there were tens of thousands Dallas County\nA combined person and mailing votes top fifty five\nThousand on the first day almost twenty six thousand more than were cast back in twenty forty now traditionally midterms do not have a lot of people to vote so you don't have to do a lot to make that number jumped but still fifty five thousand is a lot of people to vote\nAnd Scott we had gotten a couple of text messages that just as I said great job on the debate last night or on the on the forum so we had some listeners and I'm sure some people in the audience said thanks for those of you who tune in you sounded professional\nWell you know we do not like again the whole and\nWhat we do is we meet with the candidates ahead of time okay and I explained to them that the idea is when the debate is over the forum is over that those people have a better idea of who they want to vote flow yeah and number two is that they all get treated fairly and and I think those those things we try to do in a regular basis but\nI there's been times when when uh the school board race was something I really\nGot bored over to be quite honest with you because he wasn't very dynamic but\nNow you had reason only and and I\nIn ... oh yeah it really was and so from that standpoint yet from my point of view it was a it was probably the most enjoyable when I've done because they were both of them were then I told them they were great very engaging you when they were talking about\nI've done because they were both of them were and I tell them they were great very engaged needed when they were talking about\nSo anyway so what this this this high voter turnout I'm not sure who it benefits but the most important thing is that people are going out and voting you know you hate those people who are elected to office right now and you want them out or you really like these people oriented Haiti wealth is running aren't that to act\nLike but for some reason whatever it is the fact that people went to vote on the first day is a great thing\nAnd a and actually I think there are people who are voting early who probably never did before\nI always voted early I'm going to vote today I noted yet but I can tell you the ground today well maybe not this year maybe not but that's okay\nI mean it and there are plenty of opportunities and we'll keep you up today because I think this Sunday you can vote right from ten till three or ... yeah I mean they are making it as easy as possible or as convenient as possible for you to go vote so we hope you're registered and uh again most important thing is that you build up I'd say forty\nAnd there has never

I Lived through that it is it's no fun well if it is if they do have a thousand miles to go\nAnd the going twenty miles a day it's simple math I mean if you had a hundred miles to go take five days so it's a thousand miles going to take fifty days five zero\nSo how old are you supposed to get here by the election which the playing there that's kind of weird isn't it\n... but again those who are financing this and those who gathered it and those who a community organizer this they don't care as long as I can middle care about the people that are coming here\nThey care about the optics of exhibiting alert from that's it editing nine for one pack Joe packs dot com but al ... and when we come back as the writer [noise] pieces that he has had\nTheir community is in the Vatican we'd been opposed to a wall across their reservation\nYeah well it would split the slip it apart yeah\nYeah and so and that's one of the big reasons it would split their reservation apart and so what happens is that there is only a three strand barbed wire fence across that area and that's one of the salt spots where it's easy for these people to come across it's about a six day I through the desert or\nUnless somebody a there's a coyote that transports minute vehicle upright who\nSo about five miles south of the\nBe that transports minute vehicle upright who\nSort of about five miles south of the I ... interstate is whether the reservation ends\nAnd they had that five miles spot where they have to try to get across\nA lot of people ... on the other side on the reservation the feds would be responsible for charging for any drug possession right now yeah but they typically have a five hundred pound threshold of marijuana so you don't have more than five hundred pounds which any individual backpack or only probably as thirty to fifty pounds right in the building\nAnd so they wait till they'll sit right on the edge of the reservation and when they think it's a good time they'll make that last five mile push because if they get caught and put out county they're going to get charged with state charges and that's where the agenda\nOr gay we would you bordering right I'm ... I'm Indian reservation I'm guessing you have to cooperate with them to cooperate with you I Can't imagine they would want four thousand illegal immigrants on the reservation overnight\nYou know they're good partner um\nPeople don't want to end up on the reservation there's no jobs there's not a lot of job opportunities there so they want to get the Phoenix because from there it's a lot easier for them to get all over the country so their goal is not to stay on the reservation I'm although I'm sure some do\nNow their goal is to get up to the ... inner state so they transport the humans and the drugs that the cartel that's what I tried to tell people all over this country is it's not about this guy coming to wanting to work in this country any worries about our tell controlling human trafficking and drug trafficking in our country\n... quite literally if I'm if I'm geographically getting it right in my head if they get through the the reservation the first time they step in to the United states would be in your county\nCorrect yeah it's our county now our county goes quite a few miles into the reservation as well right I was a big portion of the county of reservations in our county but where it really starts to affect those bringing the drugs and the human trafficking is that about that five mile mark when they get into to where they can be charged\nIt put out county in the state of Arizona\nIt sure mark lamb he of course ... County Arizona you may or may not have seen them on a lie pd which I I loved it hopefully you will be on the Reagan chewed\nUm for me watching the caravan of two to five thousand people none of whom really need political asylum they've actually said we're going there for a better life we want we want jobs you want whatever you know you and I are are are good guys we we want people to have a better life I'm Glad that my my grandfather immigrated here from Italy legally\nUp when you see an influx like fish and it's also very close to to be election there's probably a political slant to it do you work closely with ice your close yo da chest your closely with the White House\nWho do you weren't worth seeing this massive people who maybe had to give me your county sued what do you do to prepare for something like that\nYou know I was actually on on a phone call about three weeks ago with a our eyes director because you know we have ... nice work [laughter] and I\nThought about three weeks ago the ... the director vice here in Arizona and we were talking about this issue about this this large group of people that was coming I'm like you shenanigans or going on there was too close to elect\n... I've been in these foreign countries each did their small villages to rally this many people something's up something behind um regardless of that we still have to deal with the problem right even middle whatever regardless of how they got here who's behind it they're still coming on our doorstep and we're having to deal with it\nUm and it's a tough situation\nI'm like you like you said I Want people to come here I Want you to make a better life but then again you have to follow the rules\nThat's what we're asking is follow the rules that are set for they're not coming for political asylum that they were they would have stopped in Mexico right\nThere really coming to get into America ambitions are pushed to the dangerous thing about this hoard is as they've gone further further there's less and less women and children right is ... I'm In a way man is predominantly young man\nIt's very easy for gang members and uh people that are that do not have good intentions to get mixed up into this is an addiction really easy and for that matter it's really easy for terrorists to get mixed into this group and that is alarming for us with law enforcement here in Arizona\nGuy I talked to her she got real yesterday she is a ... act for America dot org at great national security outlet it and she's just a really smart person she shows that they already found several people who aren't from ... or ... or Central America they're certainly not from Mexico they're finding people who speak Spanish\nWho speak um some other language that you might find a Middle East so there are I'm with you there shouldn't shenanigans going on ... somehow to balance the power after the capital hearings and now you've got all the co horrible Trump is on on the um on the border and I I'm not really getting into that with you but but the real boots on the ground and and that's where you literally are\nYou guys have to deal with the ... how prepared are you if you get four thousand people all of a sudden and the next few days what do you do\nYou know we work very well with ice and border patrol the ... different situation of what we used to dealing with 'cause what's happening is these people just want to get in the country yeah typically what they do is they run from they try to hide for border patrol and from us\nRight now they're actually running to border patrol and try to because they know that once they're in the country\nThey can they're making these political asylum claims and then what do we do with all these people\nYou know this is a ... this is a problem that should have everybody in this country\nIs their ears she'll be hurt and they should be wondering what are we gonna do agree\nWe're going to continue to protect our communities are we uh we're concerned about the amount of people that are going to flow into this country and in our communities and so we're watching this very closely\nBut you're from law enforcement guy and I said about it yes it's a compliment but it's also your job I ever got people up in Travis County Texas not far from where I Am\nA world where the share of just doesn't care about enforcing the law I'm going to ignore those laws on force these laws you seem to be guided shows no here's the book this is what the laws are I'm going to follow those I'm going to enforce those were to make sure people abide by them what reaction do you get from people in our county residents there last question mark and I appreciate the time\nOr what reaction do you get from them when you say if and when they get here we're going to make sure that we we you know stick to the laws are in our eastern a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much\nYou know in this county everybody understands the majority of the people understand the immigration issue we're talking with\nCars running from us almost on their ... almost every night we're dealing with drugs\nComing into our community or you've been affected by heroin it by a by spending on by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public in our youth hooked on so\nHere in Arizona in here and pronounce county ... to get it for the most part you know and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect out of the I was voted into this position on those\nGrounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we have a lot of support from our up from the people out\nOr good showing very good people and make sure we have a great sure I'm sure mark lamb but al ...
