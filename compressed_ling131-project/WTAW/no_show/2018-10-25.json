show rolls on presented by Capitol farm credit we're Rudy is vital for Harvey road in Haiti and Jean from porn or Texas a and M. athletics or were you were a thing as bad for our thing along with GMO Fisher I'm Andrew Monaco and the folks who have braved the rain\nAnd I you know what about throughout the entire state Yankee radio network hey y'all be safe out there you're listening to us in the car and drive in the middle of rain that's driven you inside this week hasn't had\nTo do that yet they didn't and now they're days today did and we probably would have went outside of the day but there was a little slick and sometimes it gets like I've got to slip character muscles and then we had a good day yesterday so we went in and get rather be outside I'd rather be out yeah but ah is what it is\nYeah you have to ... as as long as you get that good work out an audience on the grass or on the turf\nYou have any indoor and all that many still got your work down there is no doubt\nYeah also about the by we can you you touched on it a little bit of chance to go out and see some recruits isn't\nSo no doubt you got to get out and I mean at people don't realize I mean your recruiting every day no matter what your coaching you still got to recruit every day 'cause you don't tell you you're behind ... and uh so we had the first chance to really get down the road in and start seeing they couldn't stay guy\nOh you got to you've got to want to see over this your mouth and I mean you know we're playing great defense but also we're starting to drive their team starting drive down her own ten twelve fourteen Fifteen yard line it's hard to drive eighty eighty five yards unless you hit big place and we're keeping them on our fence we're getting first down even though we're not getting as many point is we need tumor right there on the edge I missed a couple of kick\nButt were winning the field position keep ... off and wonder if the team starting back our defense is doing a good job of getting off the field on third downplaying the run we're playing complimentary football and that has been good teams played each other and then we get caught up trying to separate everything you know a great place but you got to play complimentary football now faces\nWhen uh when when folks talk about um the hidden yards in special teams it's not just the number of yards on apart sometimes it's flipping the field but it's what you use a time and again when they have to start at the end as opposed to the twenty five votes hitting yards right there I mean a a word\nPlays what you do there is you can take and they know when you put keep pressure on the other team and then if they do it a couple of place they're not as ... ... you know if you come up later still amid field and I still you know you're you're out of feel go ranger not getting points out that was all those things really matter\nAnother long drive in that game I I\n... we had a bunch of Ninety nine I may have an ethnically that was Ninety four who's really Ninety seven right [laughter] so I joke with my partner development or if I said the Yankees are right where they want to be inside [laughter] but that's a great testament to the theater and we\nYou know we have one Ninety nine and Alabama down seven nothing and they never come up you don't go out and have the confidence of throwing the ball run or do whatever we have to do is and being backed up as something we work on again situational football third downs red zone all that type of stuff but even we know part two minute to minute for the half which was critical we didn't we went down for two minutes before they asked for the first round the second half\nYou know learn to steal games that way but also something we work on being backup place we call what we want to do being backed up you know or at the end of the game and how you are coming off the line and what you can do\nYou talk a lot about the number of possessions if you are have that ball control does it become a little more important to get that score off\nNo doubt and because you're limiting your possessions you helping your defense but at the same time if you're not getting the point that still the ultimate thing you've got to do and that and that is that they catch on you know if you can but when you can do both know you really look good for\nYour time and again about identity and it seemed like that last drive and Trey beyond you know puts it in but it seems like this is that part of that ad the identity of they want to be in that position and and\nJust to put in it was we didn't it didn't run it we didn't didn't threat we we mix the driver hit run we pass as we hit the tide and we get to a receiver we get to back we ran with a quarterback we ran and with a back no the diversity in which we had in distributing the ball around and making people play the whole field\nWe will get into Mississippi State when we come back to the

the FCC and I look at that roster of Mississippi State throughout that entire both sides of the football they've got some big big student\nAs long as I've ever played in that's the way they've been real I mean big athletic strong and I remember we had some great teams at different schools I was at and every time you played misery mistake\nMonday Tuesday Wednesday next week everybody trainer I mean everybody I mean they were just big physical strong athletic uh I mean they've always recruited well great players in the state of Mississippi there are a lot of ...\nAnd don't get a lot of ... small town we don't I mean you still have some really high profile guys but some of this or are there are great great players that you know you don't always hear on the radar like that and I mean just really good football like everyone talks about salmon and sweat yeah now sweat from Georgia but\nBut Simmons is from there but you go look at the rest of the line there's a lot of those guys don't make a lot of money too I mean they're they're they're not just those two guys and I mean they're all big three hundred three hundred twenty twenty five pounds off on the line fist I mean it's a very physical good looking for all day\nYou were you talk about playing and the FCC on Saturdays that translates the playing next level on Sundays doesn't\nKnow laugh at it when you can produce and if you're going to have a shot to flight ... which is the way it is\nNot just not just sweat and Simmons and not just their front for they rotate that different all I don't that you made a lot of it you\nWatch I mean those two won't play twenty five or thirty snap the game\nBecause there was a rotation going on and keep those guys freshmen and I'm so proud is so productive so when they are near the rest of it and\nAnd not play as many places they have a lot of them are tall and the secondary to tall lanky ... physical two hundred and ten pounds both safety is a corner six to six three one corner six to two twenty yeah the the corner does that does that change anything for you and how we routes of things you don't know how you attack I mean you've got to\nYour skill set of what you're trying to run somebody's what they can defend or what they do where we think are skills that is but a big long guys tend to do\nKind of get everything you liked he liked to attack a guy who's five ten back their daddy especially with the Kendrick Rogers or J. serve you can if you can but after that when they're playing and it's like a five to interpret ready to go do that too so I wanted\nTo take a look at this 'cause I've ... Mississippi State defensive line just put starters they're for starters have twelve sacks oh thirty four tackles for Los\nDisruptive failing Earth Day may sweats got ten alone ... and ... and just so disruptive and violent what they're saying is not fair I mean his hand and how those people one can create leverage and then the other five to Ninety two I mean you go through the whole list they're all like that they would gather so disruptive and what they do and then they bring blood pressure\nNow because I look at things with their big tobacco is our big down to ... ... what do you think about I mean big and six to six three athletic long the big at like football thing\nAs I say that the a and M. defensive line\nYou're you're starting for Thirteen and a half sex yeah and the and almost twenty five tackles for loss or getting there and the same thing [laughter] that's what they were there and also you get to rotate some players and it's not the same pool\nNow you don't if you have to do that people you know kids don't want to play but then they they really appreciate it once they get to the higher levels the ball you know when you were critical I Want to play I don't know and I want to Blair goes got a break [laughter] they get some areas they I mean you know when you're playing at a high level nine tenths of you appreciate it and your body does cause it alone see you're talking about going\nHow many of us would be in a situation we're in right now what about these kids are going through I mean it is all the things you used to be a bit if you're going to make mistakes and you're Eighteen to twenty two right but we were there Eighteen we want to act like a thirty five already I mean but life doesn't work that way but that's just the way it is and you have to sort through that and you can explain but\nUnfortunate for them that's the world they live and they have to get them to understand that because they can't make a mistake was made twenty five years ago and be okay it's just a different world in which we live in and everybody knows everybody's business and it's a very tough thing for these kids and then you mount the pressures\nOn you know what people say about you on the on on Twitter on Facebook or whatever it is when you play what you do what you shouldn't be doing what you're not knowing what their opinion is and so many accidents that time we don't hear so many kids his opinion\nOf themselves as based off with other people say it's amazing yeah but that's the way the world is that's the world we live in definitely changed what do you like best about Texas saying them so far people simple\nAs an easy answer that people that that was the first impression wasn't it was about that during coaches nights in the summer to people different ... the genuine honest they love it and that it's there's nothing to say goodbye there's nothing pretentious about it's who you are what you are and this is what we do and how we do it and proud of it was wrong with that\nJust nailed Aggies in a in a sentence any [laughter] or what's been your favorite memories so far being coach\nHaven't at him around looking for [laughter] for like our flag on the air though I don't even I haven't thought about that I had time to think the next next opponent always get when you go into the judgment\nOr what was the best lesson you learned from your dad oh and from your mom so there to question marks or so from your dad and from your mom\nI never forget one time my dad was a\nI Can't remember it was it was a I Believe it was a homeless man was in our town\nAnd he was drinking or something that was going on and I was a little gift probably about six years old and kind of point and then you know it was a little kid you don't mind kind of laughing and all that mental ...

All right so we've got the editing Scaramucci\nThat will be next hour we've also got a Doug ward low he is the guy the Republican running for attorney general and the great state of Minnesota and we've got um also day Finley he is an artist right now from San Antonio who is on the voice\nAnd he's doing very well just one is battling the battle rounds going to go to the knockout rounds next to them and after that will be the live shows it'd be makes it I Hope that he does he's really really good let me she'll clear I can make this and I mean there's thirty guys as soon as you actually get mad at me because of this\nI Am not somebody who buys into unproven conspiracy theories I just don't I don't buy you to them if there's enough evidence\nAnd then it does make it obvious that somebody conspired to do something that to me will be a conspiracy theory that's backed up by fact in other words you're getting the the main story is blah blah blah this happened the other thing happened to you know and then I find out all these eight things happen\nBlah blah blah this happened the other thing happened to you know and then I find a will these eight things happened and nobody's reporting and that does you know certainly show ... another story another angle a a story where maybe people conspired to do something would be a conspiracy theory\nI'm not going to take a bunch of phone calls from people who are conspiring to tell me or or they aspire to tell me about conspiring charities that make any sense\nOf ... yeah ... ...\nYeah um so I I I'm not going to take about ... years when I think might have happened and then a ... call his mother ... that that's that's not going to get us anywhere\nBut um it is certainly interesting first of all I'm Glad nobody got hurt and all these packages and get anywhere near the famous people that they were sent to\nYou they've got people putting their packages some of them were found in the post offices\nSome of the world the sorting facility none of them got into the hands of the people that allegedly with the targets that is true right Gary and that is correct yes right so let's let's let's not pretend that it was on Bill Clinton's doorstep and somebody you know tackled him to get him out of harm's way\nThat didn't happen but having said that I'm I'm Glad that nobody got hurt and I wish that this had happened the story right now is they don't know who sent it or them\nThey don't know who made the the bombs are the things that look like bombs\nThey don't know who sent the white powder whatever they do know the the the upper the way they did at the modus operandi the way they perform this this desperately Dede was to send you some directly to the buildings and do the people or they sent it and they put a false address on the front\nAnd they put a return address to their actual target\nOn the return address part\nHaving said all of that we're very close to a midterm election there's already a push by both sides to make the other side look bad could this be politics\nThere's nothing right now factually that points to that could be the only thing that we give credence to that idea\nIs that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were very very very fast\nTo come out and blame the president made that's actually kind of disgusting if you think about it it's\nIt's gross that they would say oh what a bunch of bombs were sent down and instead of trying to figure out who's behind it would've happened thank God the secret service found is that the other main God nothing exploded nobody got hurt their initial thing is the president did it\nAnd then carry read the story earlier and he's earned her words she's reading the news story about how he\nTook the sides of white supremacist in Charlottesville would've freaking lie\nSo what's on your mind\nWhen it comes to what we see happening in the unfolding in the news today and we don't have a bunch of information other than would carry just gave you let me go to ... who's in ... in Florida ... what's going on\nYeah I don't show limited ... I\nCan't get to that I'm calling from Florida but I can get you on hold on a I don't know the on cable and Florida\nWhere are you in Florida a center right\nAll right well you look at them on the fifty a WFCR that's my radio station there on on television for the second hour it's Newsmax TVs review got ... or direct TV or or or several other cable outlet you can get the show\nOkay I was going to say about this uh the bombs that were laid out there this was all this like a promise of a con job or they somebody was hey I'm from South America coming from Miami or to make the bombs so they couldn't get the and I on these people they will without actually\nAnd they were planted a by felt it was all this and they and they went from there to oh\nWell you said you know I guess I guess you mean Soros said\nSosa yes or no shows ... where are you saying ... ... from Debbie show oh shows you think there were sent from her office\nThey were uh somebody and this was hey\nDo you think about you know that's how you're just seeing stuff I mean\nI'm just I'm just saying that's just an opinion okay at the same\nAs a conspiracy theories what it is and I just said that I don't buy into the ... what makes you think that's true All right what facts you point was that she knew boy do\nI let me say this came out of Miami no facts though\nThat's all right well I'm not saying I think they came out of Miami and they were flown and that phone out of it back to South America\nBut this is this the same thing as the con job with Kavanaugh that they brought this woman vote and they pay their come on that say that Kavanaugh that all the stuff that's the same thing off I don't think it's one person I think it's more than what that was involved in LA and\nThe ... I could appreciate your opinion but again it's just a conspiracy theory and and I need more than I think that it was in Miami and I think that was sent to South America um if you've got ... information saying that every one was sent from Miami is that out there\nAnd not that I had seen\nYeah I haven't seen that either so I mean if that's true well added to the to the you know bucket of facts that we have and then we'll say OK here's what we know and then we'll try to put the pieces together but just saying it doesn't mean that is true Nick is also in Florida Nick what's going on\nA well I have a theory theory of two but I'll Try and keep it the fact but it just sounds awful suspicious I think I'm somewhat felt that ah rang through we think he's on the right track but if you just look at the facts um the fact that\nThey pick the top ten most hated are that are all Democrats liberals and supporters uh nobody got hurt they were never really meant to go off none of them went off they were very obviously they were obviously picked out long before they got to anybody a Trump with immediately blamed\nI mean all these things point to a um fear the from the left to uh give them the republic of the black I ought to gain sympathy for the Democrats\nWell again they can they can only get harder and they can only get the Republicans a black guy if there's any fact that points to a Republican or conservative doing it I think just doing it doesn't do that doesn't doesn't get me there\nI mean look listen I'm not naive and certainly you know there could be shenanigans going on here I mean without a doubt you've got to keep an eye open for that and and believe that people will do all that going to win an election\n... a certain uh early on and judges things have become so political and you're looking at a law that ... at the national is all I think a key else and it was very troubling about him is he what he has said that he wants to you is to push the end he wants to see the president over and over and over and things from immigration to the Internet and try to push it all ended up through the courts are radical agenda\nOr no less that's completely inappropriate\nThat he's an executive promise to do that has any pursuit of brave\nAnd then in the ... he said he would do that you said he wouldn't do that he would bring lawsuits against the president and try to force policy change through the courts bypassing Congress bypassing the state legislature and that's just totally inappropriate\nWithout the um the very strong very large concentrations of blue voters of Minneapolis St Paul and and the big urban areas you probably would be my twenty points Europe by seven as it is\nWhat's the message that you're getting out or what's the message that you're receiving rather from from those constituents who would turn to you to enforce the law she would turn to you and say hey let's get Minnesota back on track what are you actually hearing from people as you're out there shaking hands kissing babies\nLast lives have been done about five hundred stop all around the state a so called less Eighteen months when hearing the\nEvil and sort of want to turn down will not be political and they're tired of politics in the office that we have the courage or general and they're and they're tired of a thousand or they're concerned about a thousand pushing politics\nThrough the office and so that's what I'm hearing they're also very concerned about some support for cop killer I mean he has this is a guy that repeatedly has been a cheerleader for criminals as their jails and others on his ...\nMurders Los Angeles police officers using I I'm Sorry this is Keith Ellison ... at a rally in Arab or and tried to raise money for her back in two thousand in in Minneapolis is just very troubling stuff people are very concerned about that and it just doesn't make any sense for a person that\nRepeatedly supports killers to be a cop in this day\nI couldn't disagree with you it's Doug ward low he's the Republican running for attorney general and the great state of Minnesota um so being up by several I'm guessing that you're not going to be complacent and sit in your hands because\nIt is a very very active very shaky very dry ration filled roller coaster right now heading to the actual election day I mean one day you're up by so many the next day you're down by by whatever and I don't mean use specific me but the Republicans versus Democrats nationally anyway we're seeing a lot of that in Minnesota Minnesota ... seems to be a little bit confused\nWhen it comes to what it wants to be with a red or blue or purple or whatever it's going to be because in some races it's not even close other races it's very tight\nAre are you getting the feeling that people will stay engaged from now until the actual day they go in and start voting because there's a chance they could come down and generally speaking when the economy's good people relax and they don't go and vote are you afraid that might happen\nWell people are very energized right now the Republican base is very enthused people are very active and involved in a in quite a bit of attention so I'm not\nToo worried about that but we need to take nothing for granted just finish strong what's happening now is adequate leaning latest start would be in poll that the I think the first time maybe a decade in the Republican and a statewide race in Minnesota has had any kind of a significant lead\nIn Minnesota so the Democrats are in the state party here they're ... they're becoming unhinged and their leveling all sorts of attacks and they're just going you know there there\nAre getting very very agitated get say so who knows what they might try to throw a my way we need to be ready for everything and just finish strong work hard and run all the way through the line and you need some concerns all across the country or to make sure that we can keep Keith Ellison how they're dirty jobs office\nHe fell asleep is not from Minnesota ... who is the uh the Republican ready for attorney general against the fellowship and not from Minnesota He showed up from outside I think from Michigan address there was a seat open and I guess it was available and he thought he could win it back to the word I'm getting out all those exact history but there's a lot of outside money coming into where I Am in Texas\nFor the senators race against Ted Cruz\nI'm guessing there's a lot of outside money coming into support Ellison against you or any idea how much money is coming from outside and what these special interest might be because there is a wide a broad outside of Minnesota desire to see a guy like that would be the attorney general\n... or ... or as as\nWell put money into a an accurate and there's quite a bit of outside money and it's kind of hard to see how much I mean right now but there is quite a bit uh and so that that is a significant a problem and we need to fight back so ... and his family are one of the significance of orders you know I think and\nHe also wants to be the attorney general so he can lead other Democrats state attorneys general around the country do in their efforts to sort of go back to the president and bring lawsuits against the president and lead the resistance is how they are is put it in the past so that that's very troubling and we need to make sure that we had resources to push back against that\nI talked to Lara Trump last week the or the daughter in law President Trump she said she was in Minnesota has she met with you have the Trump been there to stump with you and for you if not are they going to be with sort of a support you're getting from Washington\nBut it's been it's been really good so I'm Donald juniors in town not too long ago and then also President Trump was in Rochester and go in the shot out of the rally there and and uh and that that was a very good too is that we're getting August for\n... generally speaking Minnesotans don't want it to be overly politicize I get that message from you today I got it from the last time we spoke\nI'm at the same time you keep on getting people like Keith ... Keith Ellison elected him in the next thing why does that happen\nOr you look like your governor he's got to be one of the worst governors have received as governor Dayton I call them ... you don't have to but I don't get it the guy is a hard time staying awake he says we want more refugees Allison is saying hundreds of thousands of refugees\n... what's the deal is it it's sort of bipolar and that's the political because\nI get the feeling the regular Minnesotans doesn't want this kind of thing\nThat's exactly right the regular basis or does not want things to be too political and Minnesota's pride themselves on being very independent\nPolitical parties and the big thing in in Minnesota but I think what ... what happens is that Democrats up and run as very conservative Democrats or or a moderate during the election and then after the election they show their true colors and then you know a few months or election they sort of a change their skins a little bit again that's kinda how it goes here in Minnesota\nSo what is the last question do we appreciate Doug ward low he's a Republican from the great state of Minnesota wants to be the attorney general I Hope to do this that he's going to be attorney general it would be horrible to have Keith Ellison a position the last question what does it look like ... now and and the six November I'm usually just nonstop for you to sleep it all just gonna be traveling to state ... what does it look like\nHe said too much traveling all over the state and\nTraveling estate ... what does it look like\nThat or is it too much traveling all over the state meetings may orders that I can just getting the message out there about how we need an attorney general's said in ... and that message is resonating and then also make sure that the president's other another back about ... and ... and we go now that all the way through the end up working very hard all the way through election day\nWell we wish you the best you know that we support your candidacy or we hope you'll be the next attorney general it would be ridiculous you would be set back you know by decades if somebody who stands accused of really credible allegations\nOf treating women to this way or would be elected but also I mean let's not forget the ferret connection Belinda SARS or connection the fact that he wants to bring in more refugees and he wants to sue the government nonstop none of that makes any sense Doug we were pulling for ya which they encountered let's talk again before the election\nDo the things that are shown restraint you dug ward logo follow him on Twitter and if you're in Minnesota by all means discussion with your next attorney general we're back after this on the Joe ... writer\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well complicated especially as the weather begins to cool well one person sleep soundly the other is either freezing or way too hot boiling branch makers of the world's most comfortable sheets\nLoved by three us presidents is offering luxury flannel betting for a limited time in Bolin branch dot com they're unbelievably solved warm and breathe the bowl\nSo everyone stays the right temperature the flannel sheets coming forging studying patterns and colors you're guaranteed to find a style you love\nPlus you'd be driving for thirty nights risk free but whatever you do don't wait last year there flannel sheets sold out and just a few weeks so go to bowling branch dot com today for fifty dollars off your first set of ...\nPlus free shipping with promo code ...\nDollars off plus free shipping right now at bowling branch dot com used my code\nBags P.

tons of stories coming out of your tons of\nSpeculation coming at you and you have to kind of like break it down I Know there are seven plus targets today\nWith these uh unusually\nNon explosive pipe bombs that were sent to um well former first families the Obamas the Clintons New York governor Andrew Cuomo George Soros\nA headquarters the CNN in New York former attorney general Eric Holder\nThere was a package address to rip a Republican or a Republican started she's not a Republican representative Maxine Waters and that was intercepted uh US Congress milk facility which was not look at it on site where the congresswoman works a\n\nBomb that was sent to Eric Holder ended up being re routed to the return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida and there was no package addressed to her but multiple packages had her address I as a return address on them so\nUh it looks like the CNN package got all the way to the the mail room one or more of the package is also contain envelopes that had an unknown white powder inside so not only was there this possibility of of a pipe bomb possibly a more rights than perhaps anthrax who knows\nA an ATF official said during a press conference at the device into CNN was a pipe bomb NYPD said the device sent to CNN was a lie of explosive device\nAnd the implication is that this ... and the other devices had the capacity to kill none of the devices went off their lethality has not yet been confirmed by bomb technicians we have not heard the lethality of\nOf these so called bombs other pets wouldn't disclose a during any of the press conferences exactly what was in the packages they said well it's consistent with the other packages let's just put it that way so we have the investigation is ongoing of so many crazy things have been done a lot of\nWhat we call security theater happening I heard something about New York and the national guard being called out why how's that going to prevent the mail from\nRefining its destination it it's just I just find it interesting now do you remember back when we were doing the rice and report remember that remember that I was talking about the rights to report and how it's going to you know all those people and I said wow this is a biological attack I guess I I I predicted\nAnd I was all over it and I was reporting it there was not really that much of any type of reporting going on in the mainstream\nFrom CNN or or or MSNBC or any group I I Know the Fox was all over because this was an attack on the president\nBut now this has happened to democratic leaders this has got you know this has got the most attention I've ever seen and the truth is is that the rice and that was sent to these uh to the mail rooms with these leaders was activity\nCould've poison someone and made\nA few staff members of Ted Cruz's opposite sick\nBut not one of these bombs went off\nSo they were sending a pipe bomb with the triggering mechanism on it you know they weren't there those those bombs were in there to take anybody out there were there to scare people they were they were they were basically scare type of tools they were there do ah they weren't there to a a kill anyone\n\nAnd uh and so that raises my my eyebrows just a little bit but I also saw the John\nBrennan or ... or bombed below the they said the bomb below John Brennan Time Warner CNN ten Columbus Circle New York New York just sit there and apparently all we have are just maybe six stamps there are no post marks on the\nOn the package so I'm Wondering if it was courier hand delivered or what [noise] but um it it's just there's so many things that I have to get through the night to make this a thorough report as one of those situations where\nI wanted to get on with Halloween and uh I'm\nI'm [noise]\nI'm committed to getting the story tonight I got gas and everything lined up or do you get the story do about what's happening what's really happening and what to think about here what this is meaning for all of us so stay with me today and uh like to hear from you as well your thoughts on this trip believe six seven three thirty seven hundred Tripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis Jewish through the ground zero we'll be back\nKind of an an a and and doing some analysis I mean the analysts here what you get as you get breaking news reports and we we prove we we've proven is with nine eleven the nine eleven shall we did a while back I wanted to I Want to just kinda reiterate this\nYear breaking news reports which are always riddled with holes there's a lot of unanswered questions there's a lot of a gag and going on where they they gag police officers and FBI\nMaine who's hitting the packages were they address to what was inside where they really are bombs in central central citing any incidents involving\nHigh profile polarizing figures in American politics who already are the frequent subjects and misinformation who already style in misinformation and then of course you have the networks that are constantly pushing misinformation to push the cognitive biased for their own constituents\nAnd here we are just what days away from his mid term election throw it on social media anyone can\nBasically speculate anyone can say whatever without any of the facts put me on the air talking about it if I don't if I don't happy in New York I live by us I'm a liar and a shill\nFor the ... or for the you know my Jewish cameras or whatever you want to say I have I don't I I don't I just can't stand that stuff yeah we all know investigations take time but I Know that you know the way this all works\nThe FBI is going to say that they're more packages out there if they haven't said All right I mean I've been following the news since I did prep for the show I did everything I'm getting is just probably an hour or two before\nI went on the air tonight so it'd be more copycat situations going on I can promise you this a more of these reports being made people are claiming they're getting bombs are\nThe more these reports arise it's imperative that you have to be vigilant you have to figure it out you have to say well you know now we have this going on we have to be aware of packages react to be aware of\nYou know a packed news that look kind of I'm suspicious\n\nBecause I I remember ah the Unabomber bombings or they happened in Utah and there was also the Mormon document bombings or the guy who uh had the bombs actually his car blew up like a block away from my apartment so I I Know\nThat that this stuff is a same mad bombers are insane because people are always fighting bombs where they don't exist that they're trying to make up stories that don't exist you have all these people you know freaking out over this\nSo\nLet me also tell you this okay if\nYou were to look through history of you look through or anything that deals with civics you know that these types of activities go on in the elections in third world countries and they do so to try to shake up the government they shake up the regime they shake up\nWho they want out and who they want and it's all done\nTo ah it's all done and it's all traced back to rogue intelligence or rogue military\nAnd what we're seeing here with the delivery of the rice and and the bombs are\nExercises and drills and and possibly even a a I guess you could call them cry wolf scenarios of a decapitation exercise is if you recall the rice and attacks were aimed at the president and military leaders the latest bomb attacks that were aimed at the Democrats mostly\nA\nLaw enforcement authorities said today that they believe potential explosive devices sent to the former secretary of State Hillary Clinton or President Obama billionaire philanthropist George Soros and former CIA director John\nBrennan CNN we're all linked that's from Newsweek us Secret Service intercepted a device yesterday or last night actually\nSend to the Clintons and chop cotton New York also another to bronco bomb and Washington DC in Manhattan and CNN evacuated employees of the time Warner center this morning\nIn fact uh you can go online and uh it was during a one of the morning shows they were on the air and they heard the fire alarm and then they were immediately taken out with no questions\nI uh I just have a catch the ... just the last bit of that today and then all went into a Wolf Blitzer and everybody else making their commentary but you should have seen the hysterics\nAnd I thought were it was a hysterics for the rice and bombs and and and why is it that that didn't get much press but this is getting a lot more press why because\nThis is political theater it's agitate prompt\nYou take something like that these bombs then go off nobody was hurt nobody was killed\n\nHe was reporting in San Diego union Tribune newspaper reporter its offices were evacuated this morning after a stack of suspicious looking packages was spotted outside the downtown building this gave ample opportunity for CNN and other news departments to blame Donald Trump\nFor his over the top political rhetoric\nTone it down Donald Trump he needs to tone it down and they and they were claiming\nThat his political rhetoric\nHis rallies or whether it will ... is what he's doing is okay and there were no comments about the harassment of leadership like you know Mitch McConnell Nancy Pelosi was harassed you saw that to\nTed Cruz so you you see all these other leaders getting harassed then we're talking equal opportunity offensives here\nNow that's why I threw it Nancy Pelosi Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz the president the generals but it's it's all the I guess you could call the incest Jewish few there they got attacked or at least were threatened today and now it's a big big deal\n\nThere were ... today it was there was there was no mention also of the negating of leadership in several cities where my violence has been common like here in Portland, Oregon in New York didn't even mentioned that they didn't say oh this is all combination in one big message was all about\nTheir their their their leaders there was almost like a leader from that like North Korea or you know they say the trumps a fascist or that Trump is a naturalist pig you do you look at the way everybody is just like so into and love being in and finding over these guys when we've had this has been going on I mean it started with the shooting of all those congressman\nAwhile back\nThere there was no mention of an ... an insurrection tactics as a symptom of civil war in this country but it's best to review\nThat this is what is happening in America the truth is is that we had been having a plethora of homeland conflicts that have been asymmetrical distributed and diverse\nAnd we've seen the conflict with numerous dynamic factions organized by social media around ideological and affinity networks antifa Proud Boys white supremacist all part of the patchwork of affiliated insurgency groups and their counterparts engaging and skirmishes along overlapping edges of their networks\nEveryone has a place in this faction of civil war\n\nAnd just say it's not a civil war I think you're blind because after the attempted bombing today will be seeing occasional high value terror attacks against soft and hard targets\nBombings today will be seeing occasional high value terror attacks against soft and hard targets mark my words\n\nAnd it's just going to continue we're bombs going off we have we have a\nThe rice and being sent the leadership suited will be schools again it will be it'll be neighborhoods\n\nAnd people tell me oh quite well not in a civil war or you want I mean this is one civil war is I mean I Lived through one in order to do this civil war [noise]\nIt is [noise]\nAnd and it's done with the ... name the guise of oh we we don't know what's going on and what we've got a caravan coming to see that look distraction distractions we got to care of incoming oh well we got some bombs being sent to all of our people you know but\nThis is an attack on the left what about the attack on the president and the generals in the south and Ted Cruz what about policy what about I mean Maxine Waters thing when she said [noise]\nI don't know if anybody's paying attention they're just like everything is just like so spaced out do we think oh these are just isolated incidents no they're not isolated incidents this is like this is like they live it's like the walking dead there was zombie who don't know if something is happening they gotta put on their

I've never heard of that\nOr at George when I saw that and I saw that in my\nBible I nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies I Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is\nAnd again don't take my word for it if if you're out there listening I get a hold of the king James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see it for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your own Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah we'll we'll let's say the wolves\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there that is what it is bizarre George it's I have no ax the only explanation and I still don't understand it and I have it in the in the new book the only thing that I can take\nOver this perhaps this is linked to CERN which is the Large Hadron\nCollider which was French board out in the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways I mean I I remember\nAs a kid the lion lays down with the lamb\nYeah then if you can get Tom you can get somebody to watch out for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scriptures in the entire Bible and now it says ...\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion lease down with the lamb or is it just is it the wolf all over the place\nIt is the wolf in every Bible now however a friend of mine\nUh he has a YouTube channel\nAh ah his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found him and his YouTube channel is that become one vacancy he actually found something for me out like old and it's likely PT a biblical encyclopedia\nAnd he found the passage with the lion and that is the only place\nThat you will see it as something and it will be in my new book stranger than fiction\n[noise] and that's it everything else George says low wolf\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he does it look at it every day for example if one day it's going to change to the wolf some\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now change what happened was\nOkay but the Lord's Prayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name like getting caught in that it will be done\nOn earth as it is in heaven give us this their daily bread and forgive us for Trump after as we forgive those who to trust pouts against us and leaders nodded to temptation the rich from evil but I came into power and the glory forever more right you've heard that a million\nDollars of course it's changed now so now that our father which are in having I never heard it like that yeah how come I Will be done in or\nIn or near where we live in earth now you live in earth do\nIs there some\nThing that changes these things\nAnd I do believe without really knowing the answer and even if I saw it in front of my face I don't know\nWe'll leave without really knowing the answer and even if I saw it from my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at a but I Do believe that it is fun and the heat wave quantum computers that are working in concert and I think that it's earned it opens up the portal and see the wave computer\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all of this sounds I assure you it's true\nThat they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing if I don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh\nThis is the Bible or make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat adds changes in it now so that can't be resolved we be in human understanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting\nIs that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed what I just told you\nAre but yeah I have Lord's Prayer carved in a stone in my own and that is not changed and it has not pitching so it's interesting to note\nThat what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone war of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre thing George\nAh do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\n... I think I Do I think I have a couple of watches what that\nOkay well I Want you to look at a a Roman numeral their rules are turned upside down to\n... what is what has happened to them\nThis effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now for where you would see a in the five o'clock position you know that would look like a of V.\nThat's now turned upside down to where it looks like an egg\nThat's weird and again\nFor anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watches uh your clocks and and and another ... and I take your photographs of this as well and people from all over the world in order to think that if\nAnd and other interesting thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock Roman numeral clock\nOn my wall that have like metal hands for the Roman numerals and not pinching\n... you know we're going to have our inch to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill\nAnd I would love to pull people on the lion lays down with lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's when it was and then compare it to the statistics are yeah I've been in so overwhelming people would say that it then it was a little lion lays down with the lamb\nNo question about I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense odd\nGeorge when you look at it it just looks so odd it's not right now let me ask you this\nThat the e hey you're familiar with the DEA correct\nDrug Enforcement Administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agents and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWow why

describe fall under the Mandela sect category or the actor jak collapse people thought he had died we did now but during his day when he was very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talked to his would that be part of the Mandela insect\nHeight I tell you it George I would venture to say yes I mean it's not just jak Polanski or the Reverend Billy Graham\nAh Nelson Mandela habits you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other um stars like this or politicians or that or or you know people that are\n... um [noise] that somehow we all had it wrong and thought these people had a ... years ago and you know a lot of those\nFolks that died in more recent years here and ah\nThere are people can swear that they remember funerals for Billy Graham and televised specials and things of that nature and it's mind boggling and\nAnd really interesting that\nI could say is that the devil is a master of confusion and division so where there is confusion there is division because if I say to you well George Guy picked it used to say this or whatever and you go no no no it's always said that\nNow we have confusion and division is going to come in and I really believe\nThat the source of this is demonic in nature and this is Jay can't pick this in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great perception that it's come on the earth I've had debates\nWith Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear that none of the scriptures have been changed it always said the wall fan all these other things and I'm an agent for the devil for saying this and\nIt it's mind boggling George and anybody that knows me and you know me well enough\nGot his first in my life I Am an agent for God I'd go all over this country helping people to be free from demonic garbage\nBut yet there were people die in debates against me on things like this that just said no way you know you're twisting the scriptures around and nothing could be further from the truth\nWhat did they say the devils greatest trick is making people convinced that he doesn't exist\nYes absolutely\nAnd it's uh I'll tell you that this is where we really have to [noise]\nAnd and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying a now is the time to really get closer to God and ask God for discernment to know what is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who is not\nBecause we are in an age of deception and it is only by the power of God and the guidance of God and the protection of God that we're going to get through the things that are here and the things that are coming\nIt's actually kind of scary that so many people the great majority believes in one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and we swear up and down that can be\nYeah it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and more\nPeople are free to believe what they want\nIt's not my job to try and twist somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God as a matter of God to speak truth and when something like this comes along I Can't remain silent on it because I feel that I have an obligation to people\nTo tell the truth and as disturbing as this is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepared for this\nLet's start with the bones Joe truck driving in Indiana they're going to start an age oh go ahead\nHi George good thank you\nThis myth fact of the free ...\n... you know\nLike a I remember it is still a lamp myself so I I don't know it's all in my mind on that\nBut that's part of an effect because I think it's an act in the actual like cereal world not just like movie floats there's a famous movie line some parents have changed outweigh remembered some song wine\nAnd like ... and stuff like that but like there was like there's a tree over close to my house or the other like the family or any of the people that live there for being there and all of a sudden there's this fact kidding\n[laughter] that's funny\nOh this is are there so I just wanted a pop that up there are\nAlready thinking would that be part of a Mandela Effect where everybody doesn't even recognize the tree and it's their\nGeorge there are people that are reporting stuff like that that they're seeing a you know things that were never there before that are there they are seeing I'll give you another example for breeze you know that that the air freshener for breeze\nYes how would you spell that\nI'm a I'm just guessing but it's I Would have said F. E. B. R. E. Z.

in an old movie it could be two hundred years old for all I Know yeah but if that plays the lion and the lamb has changed to the wolves all freak out I'm gonna have to check\nThings do you have to let me know and I'll guarantee you that it's changed so I'll guarantee you on the air right now in front of all these millions of listeners that you will find when your mom opens that Bible she is going

now this is coming down to quantum physics in my opinion and this is way out of my league it's it's way above my understanding and thinking\n... as we said in the navy\nNow way above but I I really truly feel that it it must be a combination of this CERN device which opens the poodles up and these the way\nI'm a nation of this CERN device which opens the portals up and they used the way of quantum computers that work in concert with that and somehow that now again this is quantum physics thing ... that says hey I had all these different things that are so far beyond my understanding\nBut that is the only thing it would have to be something\nThat are really is on the border of supernatural\nThat kid come into a person's home and a fact objects that are in one's possession or in one home and all through these things that is the only\nWhat if it has changed but what if it hasn't changed bill well we have been moved into another reality or that is not ours but it echoes hours in that all reality words the lion and the lamb ... we we have somehow been moved out of it\nI have thought about that and I've studied on that but what brings me back to a more sinister uh intent is that when you read some of these scripture changes George some of these are absolutely evil and Monica ... some of the things that are put in here now\nIt is truly evil so there is in tent based on some of the scripture changes there is true in tend to not only mock God but do all the scriptures in a way to where evil will be accepted as normal\nIf I went online in typed in

by expressed today an article of her own manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention call though which board president Cleveland kindly wrote back and said I knowledge with thinks the which board which you sent me as a wedding present\nI accepted as an evidence of kind feeling and friendship and can a moderate fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I shall immediately test its powers to disclose the path and forecast the future\nWhen he did take it I knew he was he took it he took it I Would leave censored back\nWell there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board it but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years fast forward for years and they are now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one businesswoman got together\nAnd came up with their own board version of it and they got it named and talk about this woman here her name is mishandling Peters not worthy\nAnd they consider her a gift tax psychic and she sat at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool before this device\nIt's spelled out we job they they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies are bon the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous\nFinally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know what I mean I don't know you if that thing there can spell out my name is George anything cabbage\nFilled and sure enough in the ... came alive\nNo didn't spend a lot of his name with somebody on the planet ... where he would choose them doing something or do the work by itself you\nKnow you got to have your hands on the plan Shen after that yeah you have to so it's spelled it out they didn't know him and\nIt was that you know that's how the story goes so this woman miss Helen Peters not worth the uh it's really critical of crucial to the naming of the board and also to get a patent said and a lot of people didn't know about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the ...\nDug up an old archives stories and letters about her and so it's it we were honoring her just last month in uh Denver, Colorado and gave her beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was her at her and buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and and now she's going to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage a group of people who do tours in his grave yard is called ...\nOn the heritage a group of people who do tours in his grave yard it's called the Fairmont cemetery in Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how to get rid of all read you board the proper way he felt and it was to burn it and he said as she was burning it he could see little sparks coming off\nIt and scream she heard screams coming on the board you believe up\nWell okay so I have the stories right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how he viewed the world her own fears or own desires and so I don't mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we can't even\nTruly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even affect our world's they're creating their manifest yet I'm going to say that the story but what I Will comment on some board don't burn very well because it might be made I made the night\nAnd the worst thing to do it really burn a board I mean you could sell that on ... could have sent to us\nAt the ... society will take 'em and we'll refurbishing and sell them they've given to a loving home they really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nSharing what's the oldest board you recover crush\nWell for me and my oldest boy the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got a raft they've started started being made and Eighteen Ninety One and production minds one year after that\nSorry how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show\nMust be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a weed you board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've got a producer there\nAnd ... board is in the studio with me that I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong what commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though\nThe board that monitors you know my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out or didn't know what was on and what was off it was weird and I finally told my producer Howard at the time I said I Would get this thing on the year he took it out\nAnd within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I want this is weird anyways what I didn't know what the time was Howard ... widow news guy named Daryl\nAnd how word game Darryl ... board he should've done George and I don't want this you try to get in Missouri took it as a gift I didn't know that\nAnd um you know I Do not sure if that works and that was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone\nAnd I won't bore that's weird ah again not knowing that he had the ... board\nI I run into him about a week and a half later is at a restaurant and I went Darryl how're you I'm sure you've heard you're not one of those anymore and they weren't George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard gave me that we'd you board\nI got fired I lost my relationship\nI Can't get a job I I got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better how do you explain that ...\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there then to look at yourself you know maybe it's filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning\nWell I you know you want to blame that we've all by something that you want to make a mysterious you don't want to look at something logically first it was\nIronic that it it's very ironic\nI but I have to give you that George but I got to say we we we ... the the the board because it's so controversial and it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reaction than people\nWe really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say the board did it but that happens too often get it's almost easier like

a permission explain that\nWell we have the\nAbility to interact and reach into the unseen dimensions it from when we came up where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between live\nAnd so I I came into this world as a very young child scenes they're having imaginary playmate having positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have those connections and continue him throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allow me because my allowance become my a gateway or becomes just a channel I used to do what I actually can do I mean I did this as a child\nThat he put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that and not to talk to beans that aren't there imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting away but this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child but and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that lets me do this\nIt's myself with my ... my beliefs about the ...\nMy allowance at a village to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that left me moving around and interact with them\nHow often do you use the board not as\nMuch as I used to I'm doing a lot of work George direct channeling\nI'm with my voice or writing off the board more often than I'm using the board but I use the board would say about once every two weeks maybe twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it once a month\nBut I I prefer to work with a partner at part as a very busy travel schedule himself so we do get together we'll do a session I might laugh anywhere from three to five five enough hours having said that I Do a lot of ... a sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do answer people's questions and let them have readings\nUm and I do live shows like that like I'm doing one on Halloween evening as well um so I I I really try to interact with people with a tool and when I'm not you that I'm most the time talking about writing about it or answer people's questions about it\nWhen you travel with the ... board does anybody freak out\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do I do it yeah you know you can always hide them um and I do to help my boards I always have a traveling for with me and if I don't have one forgot one which has happened all you gotta do is get a piece of paper right the letters down put the numbers down yes and no in a way you go with the coin\nWhile the rest of the several hours gonna fly by so let's get some calls in for you Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program high energy\nI think you taking my call and say\nWe want to go right right ... back when I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that he could do out of body experiences and his family has really religious and they didn't like the thing the the practice and they put him in a home for a while while and me if I had a we keyboard\nAnd I had been ... actually I Do he said well if you taught me I can give my body and I can come visit you so one night me and my girlfriend her baby my brother and sister\nAnd after they might say that we decided to try it and it was a really calm quiet night it was warm and the windows open and we had the front door of phone you know it was\nEarly eighties we had really nothing to be afraid mhm [noise] and we're trying to talk to him next thing we know we heard a weird noise and the front door the screen door open\nAnd there was an open so we jumped up and when he planned the door locked it\nAnd just started cutting all the money to because we were like oh my gosh somebody tried I'm In the next day he called me because for good behavior he was allowed to make calls so he called me and he says\nWhy just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I came to live and stuff and I'm Around me I said that's it I get rid of that we\nHaven't looked blade things Angie grudge stores\nAndy that's the I I Love when she stared at what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people is higher\nShe shared it what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher cells\nYou can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's an it's what it is it's really you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of the cells that exist\nLike the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience and so you start having these other dimensions of a person so I don't one bit doubt that you can do that as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad ending to it\nYou know and I think she just put yourself because it is kind of weird at first me start doing this and you go how do I talk to that person is still alive isn't the board to be used with the deceased person will no I learned that this board can become your costs make the phone\nI I use it as a cosmic phone like I Would have wireless phone I dial on the frequency through my intention through my thoughts through my feelings and then I can tap into connect\nBecause I've trained myself over these years to all these different things that are in and around and for me I use it for personal growth self development and helping people with its closure from Greece or just evolutionary expansion\nGene truck driving in St Louis ... go ahead\nEugene George or you know like you're like oh you're you're\nThere and with all due respect I'd like to disagree with your book they just record you know what do you say that\nWas only out of the board it's things that are coming out of you and you really can't buy that because you're talking about their ... the people who have never met the man\nRival gives you the board and the board shoulders man these people have no idea who you are really there was more jobs being coming through the board in may on\nBefore they ever got there and you know\nWere warned not to have\nCommunication would spirit because it is that people will want and the living will they will die but did not anything I really believe that you're going to an end you bank your spirit and they will ... where did you you can you do that\nGo ahead and journalists react to that thank you\nYeah I think again I'm so listen when I'm Talking about abilities we all have a six sensibility we have ability to be intuitive and path ache to gut feelings your heart feeling we'll talk about your guy or you had you had sneaking suspicion something was right or wrong\nThat's the abilities and how that turns out and humans life we often have will have dreams of prophecy will have 'em sock them like something just doesn't feel right here or gosh I've known this person for years it's do things I'm Talking about when I was born people use the word on this level of using the board you're able to bring out\nYour own six sensibilities so these people using the tools were able to tap into that whether it's they're eating motor using a subconscious mind which include\nThese abilities of psychic abilities or medium ship or um even just tapping into just your your knowing this\nOr they connect with the spirit now I'll address the second part of that he talked about you were told not to do this often told not to do things that will keep us in control and keep us down\nAnd so what I found is we are told you have to have an intermediary to talk to spirits you have to meet in a merry intermediary to talk to God and I find that I have a direct connection to all these beans which has been nothing about loving and beautiful\nSo with all due respect you and I disagree with you but I think we both can have an opinion because you're gonna find George that's the stream and on the other extreme you'll find people in the middle to and that's OK\nPam's with us now in Washington burn Connecticut He ... good morning\nPam Hi I'm so thrilled to be able to speak with you I Can't believe this is this is what I've been thinking about so strongly\nThis is the most amazing

know forty or fifty thousand dollars to student loan debt but this goes directly to the principal so it does help\nPay down overtime and car heart offering to pay up to ten thousand dollars so that's

were mailed these things\nAnd again they there are a lot of package as the ... started as you know one went to bomb Iran when Hillary Clinton and now there's a long list of names of where these things are being sent\nYeah you're saying there's a second ... well I don't know it's just it now I don't know it's just very odd that\nUh you know in some cases they had Debbie Wasserman Schultz name on the return address was misspelled it a couple of cases in 'em\nAnd clearly they're not they're not telling us everything which is fine that's okay we there's some things we don't need to know about\nBut ah I'm just going to presume that they're you know of course the FBI has been in it for a for quite a while so he was he talked last night as a matter of fact that the president did he was in Wisconsin and uh he was talking about these packages\nMy [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd then we\nWill go on and we will bring them\n\nMy first thought is this the president can't you put a microphone in front of him I have to put a microphone in front of the speaker you know what I'm saying here is again\nOn our democracy is [noise]\nDon't see that tolerates\nThe threat of as a matter of political or for oh\nGod what if it were overly prosecute [noise]\nSo there you go that's the president's speaking last night in I'm In Wisconsin about that situation but that was good Trump\nIt was a yeah that's exactly what he needed to say the presidential it is a little different than you know when he was talking about knocking people out and then he comes back into the violence has no place in politics mhm um but that's exactly what you need to say\nSo for him so there are lots of things that are in an an question in ballots that don't affect Texans the one that I found pretty interesting is that in California of all places\nThe people I guess it finally had enough and they have a ballot referendum to re send a six cents a gallon tax increase on gasoline\nAnd furthermore that any tax that is a tax increase on the state level in California must be approved by the voters now the referendum\nI don't know if it's binding or non binding but they're going to have at least put it on the ballot so maybe some sane people in California finally decided they paid enough taxes they want to have a little say so yeah I Do that again\nAlso if you're looking for places where Obamacare could thrive\nUm they're apparently referendum also on ballots see a key provision excuse me in the Affordable CARE Act is that it can extend healthcare coverage to people who are not already covered by the federal program\nBut they earn too much money to qualify as a subsidized coverage that they have so there are some states that are looking at at doing that and extending it they're Eighteen states\nEr which include taxes that have refused Medicaid or from day one when it first came available twenty fourteen and in fact a Texas kind of leads to pack because\nWe are in the court system right now trying to uh take care of the Affordable CARE Act and just take it off the book so we'll see how how that works All right there are people are voting yeah spy problems that a worst I'd MSCE is that where they have the\nProblem is that is where they had the little forty minute delay there you go I didn't hear about well\nYeah I mean I Know it was introduced but [laughter] I uh dot dot dot was doing some other thing I Know that if I had said yeah I Know\nThey had a they had to replace apart um on one of the machines and said there was a little bit of a delay there at the end I see but this is the last time we'll have to use these voting machines apparatus\nCan we got now it'd be coming you these companies they don't do they ever do like a a I guess a median age\nFor all the volunteers up there at the voting I don't know where you have your time just say well I mean yeah whenever I Do about it and people would have yeah I mean here's the resembled people to get me wrong but here's the reason they've got the time no that's true\nYeah I mean and I think that's probably why it skews in that way and but understand and you know I I had that exact same thought maybe four years ago okay because we were switching over some pretty sophisticated technology and you see folks who are older than I was running that\nBut today I mean look around at the people who use cell phones okay it doesn't matter where you are\nPeople know the technology and so they learn the mechanics of whatever they have to do with that piece of equipment\nBut I I understand your point back but I think in today's world\nOr if there are people who can't do it they just go sit down there and they let somebody else do that\nSo uh but you know you're willing to you know if you're willing to volunteer I actually volunteer I think you probably get paid something to be there oh really yeah no that would then you have to deal with people like me and then you know we want to do that we're going in and seeing Betty Gina Martha okay yeah that's it and you can tell stories and that kind of sure\nBut the thing is they're staying pretty busy or Texas Tribune is tracking every county\nIn the state of Texas as a matter of fact\nAnd that again as we mentioned the other day if you're dealing with a mid term sometimes those numbers aren't very big but just to understand that this was as of Tuesday Fifteen thousand five hundred and forty votes had been cast in bras is county\nFifteen thousand five hundred and ... which represents Thirteen percent of the registered voters so\nThat's pretty good after two days yeah yeah ideas to get to the vote out the governor will be with us tomorrow morning we'll talk to the governor he's ... he's asked to come back on her show and I said okay we'll do that I guess we have it won't be during this segment will be later on in the show but nonetheless you'll be there too I think probably talk about getting the vote out that's the idea um\nIt it's going to be interesting when you have a high voter turnout I still think that challengers have a better chance it's kind of the way I look at right maybe right may be wrong well do you know the the day after the election but the ideas get out there in the guard six forty eight\nNeedles spirit and it will be back with today's ...

W. College Station Bryan\nRunning for the center for tourism mostly marriage university\nGertie of the latest on a ... what do we do the turban earlier we did the bomb earlier we did we the bombs yeah with the leaders of the Caribbean what do you have for me\nFrom Fox News President Trump tweeted a stern warning Thursday they migrate caravan heading toward the United states telling the thousands of people currently making their way to Mexico to turn around as us troops are set to move the southern border to those the caravan turn around me or not letting people in the United states illegally the president tweeted\nGo back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing\nSome sweet comes only hours after us official confirmed the Fox news hundreds of us troops just had to make their way to the southern border to help homeland security and National Guard troops to deal with the migrant caravan\nOfficial that roughly eight hundred active duty soldiers would be sent to the area to offer logistical support including providing tents and vehicles to the Twenty one hundred National Guard troops on the southern border assisting homeland security it's unclear which you'd have to be deployed to the border or why they're being deployed since National Guard troops can perform the functions\nThat defense secretary Jim Mattis could die in the deployment orders as early as Thursday federal law however prohibits the use of active duty service members for law enforcement inside the U.S\nUnless specifically authorized by Congress and Trump tweeted earlier Thursday Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border and then he was using the military for what he called a national emergency valley they will be stopped in apparent reference to the Caribbean which is still about a thousand miles from the U.S Mexico border and starting to dwindle\nAnd previous migrant marches have largely dissipated before reaching the United states\nIs probably care that migrants once estimated by the United nations to be more than seven thousand strong it's hoping to make it to the United states most or Honduran seeking to escape the poverty and violence that plagues of the region\nIs going to throw this out there and it was a Fox story your story of Fox made sure the sub joystick most drawn doors will know that we don't know who these people are we we don't know how many people have been injected from the middle east and from elsewhere\nWe know that there are factions in there from other than Central America in North America we come back we're going to break it down with which I had a girl ... encourages set of more what do we know that the caravan and what is an investigation into a boost these bombs these alleged bombs what does that investigation looked like\nThat that David right even if they would say so uh adding all those things together it appears at this person or somewhere that wants to get\nAttention whether the rather than some of that was actually kill is this my definition terrorism\nYeah it is terrorists because we're all for it people are afraid and causing fear they're causing public attention that's part of the working definition of a terror attack or terrorists as you get five dollars and\nWe don't know who did this we don't know if it's some sort of it\nYeah ... ... ... thousand\nWe don't know who did this we don't know if it's some sort of be a you know extremists on the writer extremist on the left we have no clue\nAnd hopefully we'll find out sooner than later or do you have to you know on on CNN and other networks making this about the president and who's alleged rhetoric um any any surprises in your mind that CNN and other\nOutlets are now reporting that well this is really temping down the excitement on the right and conservative probably will go and vote now because of his and he thought so many\nWell again we live in a very political world in a media obviously has their own political views you know reporters express their political views in ways that are offensive to many people\nAre I think most Americans are sophisticated enough to know which channels to watch if you're going to get a particularly spin on the news writes a and so that's that's to be expected I think we're living in the new normal now where certain\nNews networks they don't report the news anymore they're obviously rooting for what side or the other I think people can pick up on that\nIt's important to mention ... bit Maxine Waters in her rhetoric about harassing people in public who you know starting up\nAnd being loud and reading them down would have been in a restaurant or a gas station that was a big deal that's just politics as usual but but this thing suddenly used the president's fault because he he dared say your fake news it's very strange to me it's Jeff Jeff ... lieutenant colonel of course he's the director of the center for tourists law\nAnd St Mary's university Jeff who's in the caravan ... and why don't you tell me the names of all fourteen or Eight Belles and whatever it is today but um who who do you think we're finding you've met Karen banning and usually you believe from your history you're in your experience that they could send out a tweet and have seven thousand people gathered\nIn Honduras and start heading north\nWell you know there's many things that we have of answered about this this care and I don't care or whatever the\nHorn people whose lives yeah\nEven land because uh you know one thing we can be a sure of it you know if this\nIs this group of individuals is not halted before they get to the U.S border or dealt with in expeditious matter at the U.S border you'll see another caravan and another caravan twice the size and three times the size\nYou know if you build it they will come yeah so the question is you know do we have the right to have national borders and to control who comes into our country or not and that's something that our Congress needs to deal with with a lack of\nThey haven't done it for a very very long time or the president in many ways is hands are tied into very sad sad state of affairs to me that uh that were eating\nEven in a situation um but yeah in the care and we've got different reports even coming from El Salvador Guatemala government officials are talking about you know individual that could be terrorists in the group well it's certainly there are X amount of criminal associate with this group\nUm and you can expect that you know that most people that come here illegally have to pay someone to bring them across the border\nThis is a cheap way to do it and that's why you're getting a lot of people are attracted to come to it but whatever the motivation wherever they are they don't have the right to simply show up and he'll demand that we take care of these individuals at our country that's\nTo me that's a logical and it doesn't make sense or we have a process we have a legal process I'm all for liberation against illegal immigration\nAid so cynical Jeffrey ... whose book is called radical Islam why go and get it yeah we're hearing that there are factors the middle eastern they're really matter of fact you from Asia in their um you may mentioned before we started the interview today and I thought this was a very salient point that there are people who were covering their faces why would you have to cover your face if you're looking for a better job at a better life\nYeah exactly and if you look at the you're just do the visual the vast majority of hearing aid to be able bodied working age a young male you know so you're wondering okay so uh you know I understand that the economic problems are here or there in your country but can't you stay there to work to make life better place or\nYou know I don't I don't know the narrative is strange to me or whatever the whatever the reason I can appreciate I can sympathize with people wanting to better themselves nothing wrong with that but we have a legal process that legal process has to be followed\nA legal process has to be a better uh I think articulated by huh how and who is allowed to come into this country\nIf you're seeking asylum international law is the first country that you interact is where you seek asylum and that would be Mexico not the United states\nDid some technical Jeffrey ... central Jersey last marriage university just as the commander in chief have the right to say this is an invading force and put the military on the border\nIt can make that determination and and uses emergency powers to do so we do have a policy called the hottest act that says the federal government cannot uh support this is the congressional law passed back into hunter's can have\nA law enforcement to make arrests or searches and seizures but if this is a national security interests are where individuals are coming across the international border which is our border uh I think the ... act doesn't apply circumstances of that nature in my personal opinion if they can't be done\nUm but I Would like to see that as a last resort I think we need to work out a some type of system with the Mexican government the Mexican\nAuthorities or they're going through their country they're saving to make no effort to turn them back or to deal with the\n... do you think it would be likely that will be affected with the president said forget it to us MCA that new agreement that we just made\nThat's off the table if you don't stop something you don't do something it would be effective or do you do for the Mexican government to step up and take action to do hope this this whatever it's called ... and whatever before it gets more border can you think of something that would be effective\nI mean in a economic pressure is one way you can uh negotiate with the Mexican government and I think that's probably a very effective mechanism that we have at our disposal\nAnother way would be to build a wall so that they cannot come into the country and claim\nA you know do the catcher least process uh because yeah it's true that you know forty percent of people that are here illegally overstay their visas they fly him right but the flying there there was that the drug cartel people sort of a criminal elements\nThose people are walking you know that's a concern that we have with a sixty percent or walk across the border but again just back to basics are worse sovereign nation\nWe're a nation state United Nations is built on the concept of national sovereignty or we have the right to secure our borders and determine who comes into our country uh and that's you know just what a city common knowledge and should the common responsibility and common sense\nYou know does it makes perfect sense in in rational mind would would think that way of course there were many irrational people in this country we shouldn't have borders and a lot of them are big names you know one of the left\nOr each lieutenant colonel Jeffrey ... director of a December tourism ... members university but even the book is a radical Islam why one last quick question Jeff ... and I wonder if you've got a quick answer to very complicated question um how does this thing resolve itself are they going to get here are we going to have eight to forty thousand people just show up\nWell the secret is that we have far more than the number of the Caribbean and coming up it come across the border every year\nBut this is a headline grabbing thing and people coming together so it might be a silver lining here were pushed pitch and what's really happening on the border here at the number of illegal aliens streaming across the board or something to be done\nNow I'm with
