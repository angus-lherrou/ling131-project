I'm sure molten dot com due to read her blog but I Want you to do is you don't you're going to reduce showing your TV was used\nTo do any credible investigative reporting um I wanted to tell you about these guys know movie I didn't know you touch one wants to turns out it was really hard to raise money for his movies we usually movie about well it's actually called the trial of America's biggest serial killer I Believe this guy was\nAmerica's biggest retailer one show so much trouble to make obviously a very interesting um ...\nWell uh the bottom line is that the a radical abortion is and the Democrat Party and on the left\nI Do not want to acknowledge the horrors that are committed in the name of so called reproductive choice and my attachment to the movie into the story goes back to two thousand eleven when almost nobody else was paying attention to the story\nI and I first blogged about the grand jury report\n'em in the indictments against Kermit gods now who murdered multiple born alive babies as well as being responsible for the death of a woman in in his clinic\nI'm back in in twenty eleven and ah what was stunning about this grand jury report that was issued in you know Democrat liberal Philadelphia or was that they acknowledged that time and time and again government agencies as well as women's advocates looked the other way at the blatant\nCereal crimes that were going on I'm at a centrally out in the open so when an ... and feel I'm ...\nI decided that they were going to first write an investigative book\nAbout uh the crimes and then I'll turn them into a movie I volunteered to use my platform any way that I could to help them and initially they tried to crowdsource the movie on\nA Kickstarter and were kicked off by pro abortion sensors on that website they had to go to ... go go and I donated personally three times to the movie and so did many thousands and thousands of other small donors ran into point three million dollars\nTo get this movie made and it ended up in the top ten of movies this weekend despite a campaign to to shut up any kind of publicity for the movie\nIn ... she was ... trial and it was his biggest serial killer was rolling raising money on Facebook and how about advertising on on NPR I mean there was ... everywhere\nEverywhere that's right Facebook up a block them from putting promoted ads on an NPR refused to run an ad that told the truth about\nAh who ... well now was he was an abortion doctor right and they objected to this plane a description of of who he was and what he was and again it goes back to um all of the grim euphemisms that are used by the left in the media to cover up what actually goes on in these abortion clinics\nIt's been a long time since Jeffrey Dahmer did discussing things yet we still view about him in pop culture news stories and so on we never knew about this guy and all this guy used used talk the way the media does want to talk about on the left doesn't want to talk about them when they just want to talk about a Muslim purpose right\nIt is it absolutely is on purpose and he really should be in that same pantheon of of these most infinite\nA serial killers who are in so many ways glorified 'em by the mainstream media and by Hollywood and\nUm and I think that it I I think with regard to to God's now um I've I've made it very clear about the movie and the book by the way that it is appropriate and safe for um teenagers to see this movie and um it is rated rated PG Thirteen and there's an incredible cast\nA including dean Cain Earl Billings Sarah Jane Morris uh next year see and I'm Andrew clay and who was the screenwriter here an incredibly brave and bold um film that I Believe that the intersection of art and investigative journalist\n... dimension you watch your show on TV also ... which I'm old enough to know what did you see on television when we come into the great mind\nYou and I realized because this huge we take that we're going to be discriminated against by the mainstream we get that mix usually get away with that I was doing gene to judge how did these that because a lot of actors told the new movies I mean after your movie because you might do do do you detect some didn't\nIt did and you know without I was at the premier last week in Los Angeles in a theater in Beverly Hills\nAnd you know this is hostile territory for outspoken conservatives and so it made it all the more points to me to be able to meet so many people who worked on the film or who were behind the scenes people who are\nUm you know stage a crew um and and then I met a lot of people who um are you still have are not as a ... in a position to come out about their politics you know they're not established um actors or\nUm filmmakers are directors\n... um actors or um filmmakers director's um but I think that you know as a result of everything that's been happening over the last a year or two years it's really in Boulder people to come out who who wouldn't have otherwise spoken out before and that's a good thing\nI Want to be able to go to this movie it's God's know traveled America's biggest serial killer this is Michelle ... dot com and again watching TV show\nOn TV one last quick question I I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you this heavy into the midterms I got us in the cabinet that looks really good for our side but we're so far away from the election do you think that conservatives me we take a chance to people starting to relax and sit on their on their hands again on an election that we need them to be empowered and get out there and vote\nThat it absolutely right and I and I think that it's not just the cabinet effect but even you know the latest um\nPeroxide of mob violence that's broken out all across the country the thing is that the left can never help itself and on the heels of even just this past weekend where we had Hillary opening up her mouth and writing as another gift\nUh with her accusing her husband's abuses of power in the Lewinsky scandal right and then on top of that Hillary and bill going on they're corrupt pollute the\nTour and now all of it or in making this unfortunate error with Eric Holder yeah you do is sit back and let these people ... how ... Eric Holder just kick us in the face while we're down or something yeah what does not get in a way of themselves\nSo I I Hope they keep on talking to the next few weeks but it seems I don't want our side to forget about what just happened with cabinet because people are sick and even those who are center left or sickened by what Feinstein in the group that\nThat's exactly right and you know a lot of the investigative work I've done for the RTP over the last two years have focused on wrongful convictions and particularly false allegations of rape and it has crossed many at a logical line even if a lot of leftist won't talk about it\nThey know what's happened with the burden of proof in America\nAnd they know that what happened to Brett Kavanaugh could happen to anyone and do this this this mid term it's not just a a referendum on jobs versus mop it really is about due process those things we hold dear\nUm and the fact that you know many families and parents look at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh look at his daughters and his wife and I think to themselves\nI've got to protect my daughter but I also have to protect my son my husband my uncles and my grand ...\nDot com she her TV show on TV these investigations are amazing by the way Michele thanks for your time today\nYou bet thank you go back after this and the Joe ... writer\n[noise]\nHis show show [noise]\n\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone else you'll actually built asleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the interests of match your body type\nAnd sleep references to the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper like a plush or for bed which he looks there is no more guessing confusion just go to ... dot com slash bags\nPigs or two minutes lead quiz they're going to match you do a mattress that will give you the best sleep with your life you'll excuse even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals support needs and feel preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty and you get to try it out for a hundred nights\nRisk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off all mattress orders get up to a hundred twenty five dollars off at ... dot com slash package\nThat he'll sleep dot com\nSlash P.

personal question\nAbsolutely I was hoping you would yes\nAre you a sheep in wolf's clothing\nUh I'm not a sheep at all and pretty much a wolf you you see what you get what you see is what you get myself I\nMean you're that means you're conservative on like on the side but you're leaning towards the crafts airs I took a chance with each other out when you like the state like it when you make ... when President Trump is like all in a China shop\nRight he is yeah well as a boy and a China shop there Joe\n... in Russia raping right it destroys the ... it just it destroys politics as usual listen I realize that you've got a little sheep Sears in your in your face or somebody on the sheep whole thing was here here's what's real and I hear you I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna let you spent ... speaking a second let me tell you what my metaphor was about\nThe politics as usual with China shop was completely\nUnaware of Obama's presence because he made sure it stay pristine he would not step on political toes while he was growing up the country well he was making us look like idiots around the world while he was allowing Americans to die in Benghazi and was fast and furious guns\nThis guy made race relations horrible but the China shop was fine he would not have messed up the political China shop even a little bit Trump walks in and says screw you all watch this\nAnd he destroyed politics as usual the left can't take it\nBut the the even the moderates can't take it I like what he's doing I think in being a bowling the China shop is a good thing because he doesn't sit back on his laurels and just let the world happen so he looks good he doesn't care if he looks bad as long as he's doing well for the American people now I'll shut up you understand what I meant and I'll listen to what you have to say that\n[noise] so what you're saying what's your name Joe\nWell I said that day and you weren't listening very well you let them go through sheep's years ...\nKnow they're talking about a year I heard it from like presidents I get it every day oh I didn't like that why don't people say well to me\nI did I said the same thing a little while ago you just didn't understand that so I clarified\nOkay Joe anyway I Want to get in my opinion I'm a little cherry man I'll serve only one here is Leon create that away from thank you for ages seven gang up\nOr just hit forty go anyway I studied uh Germany or Germany or now they're getting all by himself\nThey won't Germany ... or ... or get it all by themselves way early twenties starting in the twenties I think\nThey I don't know who they all think now what they call themselves sacred ... a day and that's the group and not only the Democrats are ... wherever they are\nAnd the way they come across like Nancy Pelosi and its waters and all that I don't think I'm a Democrat already instead of being a liberal party is scared to death of somebody\nIn my life you can get rid of the cage to understand the constitution and you're a fan what our president is doing\nAll right thanks I appreciate you being out of West Virginia awesome\nEditing nine four one ... non for one Seventy five or seven just to make sure I understood\nHe was asking me a personal question in my both in sheep's clothing um I usually the best I could and then he tried to tell me how horrible it was that I said the president's a bullet China shop you didn't understand the metaphor that when I was saying was you had Obama who is squeaky clean looking\nAnd made you feel good was all presidential any sucked and now you're going to guy doesn't care comes in Knox things around and he's doing right by the American people why did you say that well that's exactly what I said I made the comparison right here but I Do love you and I appreciate you\nAnd look out for those people are when Germany been a better controlling everybody let me say hello and welcome to ah Peter who is in Pennsylvania but you know what's going on high\nA happy to feel a Tuesday\nOr it can be taco Tuesday but either way good\nOkay uh you know I Am certainly convinced a because they really don't know what to make of him Donald Trump could cure aids and the left would still hate him I drink I mean when you consider all the misdeeds of the Obama administration and\nI'm like I said to the ... girl to pick up the phone [noise] Hitler he must be made of Kevlar because charges don't stick to her that would ordinarily stick to someone like you or someone like me and it's horrible and she ... you're\nYou're spot on on your analogy as far as the China shop and\nI don't think he was gay and understood it or didn't like it or something I don't know\nWell I mean the simple truth is he is a presidential he tells it like it is and you know what a lot of people feel better if it wasn't on Twitter that's what I like about him\nBecause he just flat out says this is you know he let you know and to many of these liberals dance around things\nAh and this guy's keeping his promises and on top of that uh you know four or eight years of Obama my insurance up a hundred and thirty two percent or ... or ... and everything else I feel a lot better with this man in here\nBecause I feel like we're we're going to get it we're going to get it straight and he didn't remember a for you I think it was he was at a un some type of un summit he pushed one of those leaders out of the way hey Americans here baby we are back on the international\nLaw yeah let me just playing around or not but I Would I really like is when he was a breakfast not one morning and unless you're like about the butter the bagel and he looks at the guy says yeah you've been screwed my country I'm done with that we're not going to happen to be more no no we got to change it it's not right you know that it's not right I mean ... like the guy doesn't care\nAbout decorum doesn't care about political and you know that makes you wince a little bit but at the same time he's doing what's right for you and me and for the American people in a I Can't argue with them\nI Can't argue abusive to remember that he sat down to breakfast and he said\nYou're by you're helping to finance was Russian oil my line you're buying oil from Russia was not your friend and here we are protecting your for all this money that's not right is that right there is not right number legacy media trying to light 'em up over it they try to Brazil you were doing something bad\nWhen in fact you were saying we're protecting you were looking out for you why exactly would you go and give somebody else to benefit when that other person or that other entity could in fact be the bad guy\nWhat are you thinking and he was right about that\nSo I'm not really sure I understand why anybody who's confused about who this guy he is he's been in business has been for forty or fifty years he was like that on The Apprentice and pick any cramped their revisited really care and the campaign trail he made it clear who he was and how he was going to be and now that he's the president you wanted to become Obama\nI I take the good the bad with this guy there's more good than bad\nDoing positive things for the American people whose son Eric Trump when we come back he's I ate at a non for one pack Joe ... dot com\nAnd they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases believe me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nFor Trump to sort of president Donald Trump ulcer jumping national you which interested about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go ... or give us raises millions more people ... a small businesses are adding employees instead of flushing them\nBut to give us
