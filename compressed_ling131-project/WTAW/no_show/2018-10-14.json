M.\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n... service can for one issue not find a warning for central Robert Some county in central Texas southwestern Leon county in central Texas eight pm central time [noise]\nSeven pm central time severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado was located however miles east of Franklin Oregon Eighteen miles east of censoring five miles per hour [noise] hazard\nFirst of all we have the second law to my dynamics\nWhich says that in any open system things fall apart we all know that\nThings rushed things get stain things crumble things die in fact that's the reason why we die we die because chaos eventually takes over genetic mutations build up in our cells overtime cells get sluggish and eventually don't function and then we die\nThat's why we die the second law of thermodynamics however\nI mention an open system this means that in a closed system you can temporarily reversed the arrow of time so the arrow of time port points towards chaos the arrow of time points toward death destruction collapse calamity however\nThat's in an open system let's talk about a closed system whereby you can actually make changes in the arrow of time there's a loophole in the laws of thermodynamics and that is to ply energy from the outside mechanical energy from the outside\nSo you know there were some people asked a question if we have the second loved him identify acts on the earth then why do we exist humans are obviously smarter than rocks so if the if the universe naturally creates rocks however we created\nWe represent a violation of the law just to remind dynamics we are intelligent we can sing dance we can can I we can we can build atomic bombs we can build a rocket ships rocks cannot therefore he seems to a an average person at the laws through my dad I mix it violated\nNote if you add energy from the outside you can locally reverse the laws of their mind and I mix\nIt where does that energy come from de la ...\nThe sun the sun's energy provides us with nutrients which allow us to therefore reverse the laws of thermodynamics locally that this means of course that the earth will eventually die sorry about that but that's a lot of physics\nHowever it means that temporarily locally we can reverse the laws that there might not make ten bingo here we are sunlight makes it possible for the synthesis we eat the plants that arise from Port and synthesis we metabolized this class and get energy\nAnd that's where we come from\nThat's why we have evolution\nThat's why we can have things that are intelligent arise from\nRocks so then the question or ask you another question what about the quantum theory\nSo far we've only talked about classical music that is a physics of Isaac Newton the physics\nIt's about classical music that is a physics of Isaac Newton\nThe physics of Isaac Newton is based on the idea that every Adam is like a billion ball at tiny steel ball you know exactly where the ball is but in the quantum theory in the quantum theory this uncertainty you don't know exactly where that ball is at any given time\nBut yes even under the Clinton theory the second law that dynamic supplies 'cause we're dealing with the motion of large amounts of Adam's on average if you average over billions at Adams the laws of quantum mechanics gradually disappears\nThis is the reason for example why you can't be two places at the same time Adams can do that\nElectrons couldn't do that easily electrons can be two places at the same time\nBut you cannot because you are very big that's why you average over Chileans upon trillions of Adam's each atom being many places the same time and go here you are you have the illusion\nYou had the illusion that your exactly at one place at one given time\nThat's the view that Einstein had that's the view that Isaac Newton had been sorry about that it's wrong at the quantum theory you don't really know where the electron is that's called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nThis means also that you couldn't have two electrons that are in tangles that is a vibrate together\nAnd then to separate them there isn't a biblical cord and invisible and biblical cord that emerges connecting them [noise]\nSo what happens to one electron inevitably affects the other electron that's called entanglement now the questionnaire asked a question as follows can all of this Quentin gibberish reverse the second law of thermodynamics and my personal point of view is no\nBecause the second law to return I mix operates on an average averaging over trillions upon trillions of atoms were caught the effects are gradually washed out that's why we cannot be two places at the same time\nNow when I talk about this to audiences\nI mentioned therefore that our universe could actually splits perhaps into two universes because of the country's principal and then people asked a question\nDoes that mean that Elvis Presley is still alive in another universe and the answer is\nBelieve it or not you cannot rule it out there is a finite probability of other universes being out there in which people that have died in our universe are still alive in another universe that sounds preposterous but hey that's called the quantum theory [noise]\nOkay well let's move on to the next listener phone call\n[laughter] I Know I have been in the Iraq Iran Iraq War veteran I don't I don't know it's hard on me\nThat we are a lot of her mind [noise]\nWell do you ask a question that in the news because of course the earth is a geologically active and sometimes the big earthquake creates nominees which can destroy huge chunks of real estate look what happened to Fukushima in northern Japan\nUh we had an earthquake or that erupted caught and many seismologist off guard created a huge tidal wave which inundated\nThe city and ten thousand people lost their lives this happens in Indonesia and the Philippines and the question that the questioner asked is how how our two nominees form\nFirst of all there are two major types of earthquakes one earthquake has caused went to a fault line sly horizontally passed each other like the San Andreas fault\nYou ... San Francisco and Los Angeles millions of years from now we'll be right next to each other that's right right next to each other because Los Angeles is going north relative to San Francisco which is going south so California is being ripped apart that's called a sliding fault\nAnd falls to not create ... nominees so yes there's fault is underneath the ocean one fall when you go north\nThe other fault wouldn't go south and knows nominees are formed at all how wherever you live in the Seattle Portland area you have to be worried about the ... fault not the Senate Julius fall and the cascade of your fault isn't subduction fall\nWhere wonderful lying goes underneath another fault line that cause some direction\nWhen that happens abruptly that means the floor of the ocean the ocean floor itself drops leaving a huge gap which is then\nFilled by water from the neighboring area creating a tidal wave\nSo you can actually create a mini tidal wave in your bathtub tonight\nNext time you're in your bathtub when the rubber duck you put your hands you're two hands underneath the surface of the water and then suddenly drop and raise the other hand by dropping one had raising the other hand\nYou create a tiny mini tidal wave on the surface of your bath tub right next to your rubber ...\nThat is called a tidal wave or tsunami create a bias subduction fall and we have them and they're terrifying uh off the coast of the United states in the ... fault\nNow we know the ... has directed in geologic time missed by actually looking at the ecology of the Seattle area\nSome geologists had noticed the fact that there seem to be dead forests dead forest trees that died centuries ago many many many years ago\nThat died because of salt water salt water inundated that area but everywhere you look there's no salt water and then he began to realize a hot\nIf you are so many miles away from the coastline it must have been a huge huge tidal wave that sent salt water into the coastline killing all these forests wealth\nWill continue with this question about earthquakes after the break once again you are listening to science fantastic give us a call the hotline number is six one to five six for hate one three five and maybe you can get on national radio give us a call [noise]\nIs designed to be large enough to cover your entire back\nThose are perfect ... knees or shoulder in that I Need to know they're getting quality of course ... and pillows are often an Amazon choice due to easy and most affordable when you purchase ... rate from our website\n... dot com or cola to five six seven eight one three six one day be heating pad\nWould make a great gift right yeah and they sort of just Nineteen Ninety nine and free shipping is available so coal to five three six seven eight one three sticks one worship or your sunny day any pet at lunchtime pillows dot com\nHomemakers groceries by mail ships free trying our amazing begun\nIts doors in your pantry no refrigeration required our value added packaging provide the ten year shell flying and projects silliness Ficre center God fully\nCook bacon in America today ready to eat right from a pouch or warm and serve always priceless grocery for your everyday use savory and delicious order today and ready to eat bacon dot com ready to eat bacon dot com\nAdvertising is simple it starts with someone who has a knee and then gets more specific\nBack then we added urgency pull that out before you know as you were ... the message is reaching new use of listeners listeners who are definitely in New Year's Eve advertising on the moon is simple your message meet their needs and the result means new business for\nYou [noise] does about your big boom but our super creative to ... go to work to ... just the right message to be those who have been urging me [noise]\nThis is the most affordable national radio advertising rates burian and millions of people listen to radio programs in over one dose of him and ... and streaming audio live gets daughter today was\nThe genesis communications network just choose to email ...

twenty WTO W\nHaitian algebra for example is preserved from the Greeks and algebra altimeter outlaw the names of the stars yes a lot of them have Arabic name is precisely for that reason so with so many planets out there now\nHow do we go about naming things well usually the people that I discovered these things have first dibs on making the name for them\nHowever solar systems to my knowledge do not have a name however solar system's going around a certain star happen name a we have ... percent tolerate for example alpha ... triple star system\nProximate some Terry be is one of the plan is going around products innocent tolerate proximate ... to me is the closest closest planet that we have identified\nThat is near the art so the ABC\nAnd then gives you that ... of a different planet within that solar system now this process of naming things actually became rather contentious over the issue of Pluto ... explain that really quickly first of all political discovered around Nineteen thirty\nAnd thought it was thought to be a planet because scientists were cataloguing planets they went all the way out to the urine is Neptune and the next one logically would be another planet but Pluto is an odd ball is probably not applied at the end the ordinary sense of the word at all\nBut yeah the gas giants Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune gas lines which are huge and Pluto which is more like a balloon and then a planet\nAnd it's not even a gas giant at all it's an odd ball out there and it's really part of the hyper belt that ... belt of comments type or himself as an astronomer who is the arising existence of a belt of comments surrounding our solar system and Pluto is thought\nTo be a member of the Khyber belt\nIn deference to those astronomers who insistent who is a planet we call it a ... planet so they aren't sure planets within the Khyber bell of comments that that's kind of confusing isn't it but just remember that Pluto really is not like one of the other gas giants now against\nAnd that Pluto really is not like one of the other gas giants now against more complicated now because that we may have planted acts\nPlanet X. seems to be a gigantic planet the size of Neptune way out there and so that nobody thinks he's starting to get more and more complicated there's also another object identify it out there called the goblin nickname goblin\nAnd that seemed to be an object almost the size of Pluto way beyond the orbit of Pluto\nSo once again to make sense of all these things there is an astronomical body that officially gears names to all these objects\nAnd that's where the nomenclature comes from and again usually the people who discovered that object have first dibs to coin a name for that object but hey politics is politics and you're going to be in politics even in the naming of planets and stars\nWell let's move on now to the next listener phone call\nOr this is Karen I'm calling because I like about Albert Einstein's theory term they use a genius but at the same time it's about whether or not\nOr you know like how big of a she and she was because he got ... it was wrong in the background radiation that not all of the tracks withdrawal Geraldo or Franklin acquiring astonishing discover the structure of DNA quite the same time fire incorrect actually uh I actually can produce obsess linked to\nWhat crank are already has so I'm sure there are knives locks and correct but uh and I saw the there were the ones who really discovered the yeah but you know they'll start like a A R\nWell first of all you have a point and that is we're all human and even though we see that for example Isaac Newton or or Albert Einstein were geniuses but does that really mean given the fact that they're also human\nAnd he also made mistakes as well\nYou can go through the voice of Isaac Newton for example and find many mistakes there but he ranks is perhaps one of the greatest scientists of all time\nStarting from nothing literally nothing he created the understanding of the mechanical universe and the forces of today well let's take a short commercial break\nAnd after the break we're going to continue the discussion that well really is

thousands of other people that have that same question\nNo matter how dumb it is somebody out there probably has been thinking about the same thing so why don't you give us a call\nAnd again the number is six one to\nFive six for a two and three five and the question is too dumb to ...\nFive six for a one three five and the question is too dumb to put on national radio\nAs I mentioned years ago there was a twenty three year old gentlemen who had to go home because it was a disease affecting is University He had a lot of free time and one day he was walking down a country road and he saw an apple\nFall well nothing's strange about that and then he looked up and he saw the moon\nAnd then he asked himself a question was changed human history\nAnd that question was\nIf apple falls does a moon also fall\nNow that's a stupid question that's a question they even a child would be embarrassed to ask there's a moon also fall like an apple\nWell that young gentleman said yes the moon is also falling is in freefall just like the apple and then he went out to try to calculate when this moon windfall pass the earth\nAnd then he realized that cheese the mathematics of the day we're not sufficient to calculate that so he said to him so I'm going to create a new mathematics that and you've been mathematics was called calculus that man was call Isaac Newton the greatest scientist of all the time\nAnd looking at a child's question of the falling moon he was able to get the law of gravity and able to work out the majesty of the universe itself\nWell before the commercial break we had a question about laser pointing how do we reach the stars without a rocket ship well rocket chips for clumsy you can have accidents radiation media arise and it takes for ever to reach out of space with a rocket ship why not do it on a light being\nThat's what I call a laser party one day we would digitized the human body everything known about it you will be digitized we can put that information in a laser beam like we do the Internet chute and into outer space one second you're on the moon\nTwenty minutes here on Mars in four years you're on the nearest star\nThis is the most convenient way to conquer the universe now when she lays report to the moon in one second you would download your laser information onto a mainframe computer\nThen the mainframe computer controls an avatar\nAnd avatar which is a robot a robot that looks just like you the only difference is that it's super handsome super beautiful and it is a model and ended as super powers you become Superman and super women on the moon\nThis means you can explore the universe in an afternoon thing about that one second here on the moon twenty minutes you're on Mars you can easily explore the solar system in an afternoon have breakfast in New York have lunch on Mars\nHave dinner on Venus and come back for dinner back on the planet earth\nSound preposterous it is well within the laws of physics now let me stick my neck out let me stick my neck out now I think that this may already exist\nThat's right this may already be a reality perhaps aliens from outer space more advanced than us have already created a highway a laser highway containing millions of souls they're being laser part of the poor across the galaxy at the speed of light\nAnd then the question is are we smart enough to even know about it\nAre we smart enough even to no evidence existence and the answer is no we are so primitive so primitive that right next to us\nThat could be a superhighway a superhighway of aliens souls being lazy reporters that cross the universe and we're too stupid to know it but think about that if you could leave support yourself across the solar system\nYou can journey to many asteroids many plan is just in an afternoon on each asteroid each planet and you would have superpowers\nYou wouldn't have to breathe the air you will be able to lift objects that are extremely heavy and perform these like Superman because you would be problematic you would have the body of a robotic avatar but look just like you so you would never know\nThat it's not really you and then the question is is that it really you well to paraphrase Bill Clinton\nIt all depends on how you define\nYou how you define you\nArgue nothing but a biological entity in which case we're talking to a tape recorder or are you the sum total of all the information known about your personality your was your dreams your desires your history of your personality your friends all of that\nDigitized so the question is what are you if you can be digitized it means you can live forever you can travel the units\nWho can be digitized it means you can live forever you can travel the universe by laser beams at the speed of light and how long would it take from your point of view it would be an instant\nYou simply get onto a laser beam and immediately you wake up on the moon you wake up on a distant star you wake up in another galaxy\nAll of that complements other laws of physics\nOkay let's move on down to the next listener phone call\nYeah stretched ... calling from Tempe, Arizona and I have three questions are the first one is um people say you can't um with untangle articles you can't um half inch pain from cancer and the I'm\nLikely to it is that well then you have to tell someone your data and\nInformation as to why what is on the moon people had in a three time maybe like a heartbeat write wishes happening every sentence or something that I kind of particle is going to be looked that\nThen you wouldn't have to transfer that information could you be able to one and look on the other end did and transformation faster than the speed of light\nIs my first question um in other words the timing be bringing greedy my going around having to turn that information certainly\nUm I Know this might be a potential of alternative to string theory I don't know if you actually answer this but um have you looked at what they see the ending was the quaint return an exceptional free of everything and if you have just curious if you have any thoughts on it I'm I I think it's\nQuite interesting but I'll just say no where near us down enough to be mainstream mine is my question and thank you very much for your writing\nI Love listening to it and I'll be listening for long into the future [noise]\nOkay well let me take a crack in some of your questions are first of all we get a lot of questions about entanglement so let me explain how that works [noise] first of all it was Einstein himself in Nineteen thirty five\nWho published a paper trying to destroy the quantum theory so Weinstein said let's take for example a two particles of light to follow ties to electrons to anything\nAnd puts it very close together so they vibrate in unison so we have two waves describing two particles vibrating together in unison then separate them\nAccording to quantum mechanics and bill accord and invisible umbilical cord emerges connecting that to\nSuch that if you juggle one electron then the other electron senses that\nInstantly faster than the speed of light in fact you can separate the two electrons by a galaxy\nSo that at one point of the galaxy you juggle it and the other election on the other side of the galaxy innocently Simpsons it so I said I'm Stein this violates relativity therefore is wrong\nSo Einstein relish the idea that they eat the our experiment Einstein put all ski Rosen experiment destroyed the quantum theory\nTo get information was traveling faster than the speed of light and I and science had\nNothing can go faster than the speed of light well sorry about that Albert this experiment has been done and it turns out I just I was wrong sorry about that there really is something which goes faster than the speed of light but\nYou know Einstein has the last laugh that's right I signed still has the last laugh\nWherever he is he's ... some place because you can calculate the rate at which this information is traveling\nAnd even though it sent Kenny us the information is useless it is useless random information\nYou cannot stand Morse code you cannot send a television program you cannot send the Internet on this device so Star Trek fans of course would love to have a device that allows you to contact federation headquarters at the speed of light\nAnd they think that maybe maybe entanglement will do it all on Star Trek they talk about some space sub space communicate is a lot of Captain Kirk to talk to your lactic headquarters at the speed of light instantly faster than the speed of light\nWell sorry about that it turns out that\nTank quantum entanglement or does not work faster than the speed of light for usable information now here's an example let's say you have a Red Sox and the green sock and you put one sock on red and the other side is gonna be green you got that\nOne leg you put a Red Sox and the other side can put a green or vice versa let's say one day one day a friend of yours does is putting on socks and you lift up one passed away is green\n[noise] now what is the color of the others sock on the other leg well obviously has read any idiot no is that right now [laughter]\nHow fast it you know that once\nYou do that one song was green how fast it you know there's the other side was there at well instantaneous I Would say aha this did travel instantaneously faster than the speed of light but it is useless\nRandom useless information so sorry about that\nYou cannot go faster than the speed of light with information science has to last last okay let's take a short commercial break once again the number to call is six when to buy six four have won three five and you can get on science

back to science fans tacitly professor Michio Kaku once again if you want to get on national radio and ask a question that's always\nBeen bothering you then give us a call that six when two five six for a month three five and all we ask that you leave your name\nCall it isn't a radio station if you're listening to one and a city you're calling from and perhaps you can ask that question make that comment and get your thoughts turn it on national radio\nSo once again that article is six when two five six for eight one thirty five\nWell before the break we had a question that came in and that question comes from optics that it's a theory of light which me teach here at the college\nAnd that is well light a white as light take the shortest path between two points if I have point hey and point B and us ways the shortest path between point a and point be it would be a straight line\nNoticed that you take a mirror and you have point a above the mirror and point B a distance away but also on top of the mirror\nAnd their life being goes from point a bounces off the mirror and then his point B and then the question is what is the shortest path between point hey the mirror\nAnd point be [laughter]\nAt first maintained yourself that's really hard I mean you would have to draw all the light beams that go from point a to the mirror and point be well know get a sheet of paper and jogging near a straight line drive two points next to the the line on the right hand side point a to point B\nAnd then draw a line that goes from the point hey to the mirror bounces off in there and goes to point the on the same side as a mirror you may senior so well that's very difficult how do you calculate the shortest path\nBetween point a to point B well\nWould you do is you get a mirror and simply you draw the mirror image on the left side of the mirror so point hey is now has a mirror image on the left side of the mere point B has an image on the left side of the mirror at all\nNow draw a straight line between point a\nAnd a mirror image of point B and bingo you have the answer\nIs a straight line a straight line that goes from point a to lose a mirror to the image of point B so light really does take the shortest path between two points why well that's a principle of optics but it also comes out of something called Maxwell as the equations\nYou see the laws of light obey and equation that as well known has been known for a hundred and fifty years and it's called Maxwell the equations Max's acquaintances are so powerful that they're using lasers\nIn radar in telescopes microscopes you name it anything involving electromagnetic radiation\nIs described by max those questions\nIn fact matches equations are so powerful that Einstein was able to extract from at the consequences of light traveling at the same velocity in a inertial same\nAnd that became the basis of relativity and so the reason why like behaves the way it does is it can be ... it obeys a higher equation called max those equations\nNow this means that other particles have their equations as well\nThe electron has this equation called the Iraqi equation\nThat Iraqi equation allows you to calculate the properties of electrons anywhere in the universe that Iraqi equation and then the question is is it an equation which describes all particles that would be the unified field theory so far the only theory which a lot\nPickles that would be the unified field theory so far the only theory which allows you to describe all particles by an equation is string theory [noise] okay well let's move on down to the next listener phone call\nHello professor Koch who this is Paul Yaz Donny I listen to you on the podcast on the Internet and I live in ... Maryland my question is regarding electromagnetic waves or understand the electromagnetic\nWaves propagate whose face the speed of light but how 'bout magnet take wage low mainly when you turn on the electric magnet and posted does the electric Paul's travel the speed of light I think you have a great day\nWell the answer is yes a voltage electricity and magnetism travel at the speed of light in

estate one hundred percent of the time [noise]\n\nAnd we are back with our very special show set for life\nAnd then to look at starting a real estate portfolio when you were still\nReally young and right now a real tour in his early thirties who's been buying investment properties for nearly a decade and as his experience grows he uses that to help his clients both young and old become successful investors themselves\nJoining us now is Philip Becker realtor and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas in two thousand fourteen Philip received a prestigious dirty under thirty award from any are and among his investment properties is one in the U.S Virgin Islands [laughter] Phillip welcome to real estate today\nThey travel is David it's great to be here\nWe're delighted you're hearing by the way good choice on where to locate your investment property\n[laughter] not not a bad place to be beautiful son and Sandy beaches\nExcellent so Philip how old were you when you started investing in real estate\nWell when I bought my first investment property even I was twenty four years old wow it was a piece of land outside of San Antonio Texas what I did is I bought the land built a house on it and turned and sold the house and made about eighty thousand dollars profit\nSo fill up you also help your clients invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nOh yeah absolutely especially with novice investors are people that a lot of people think you have to be cash heavy to get into the game and you know when I first started\nI was and then my my first investment was an owner of finance deal when I bought that land with just ... percent down and so I help a lot of investors especially younger myself I'm thirty two now but I was twenty three when I got\nInto real estate in two thousand nine\nAnd I have a lot of younger people that are able to help with investments and it's great to show them how you know things like solar financing and even use responsibly financial products such as hard money alone can really help younger people build their portfolio\nI see no one at twenty or thirty something comes to you and says they want to invest and they have no idea how to do it how do you help them\nI think just with every other Clyde it starts with a buyer counseling session\nAnd one of the big things I tell my clients is don't be afraid to invest outside your market you know even for people that are just getting started specially if there are a little bit low on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why\nI mean getting involved with you know the national association and committee such as a young professionals network has helped me grow realtors that I trust throughout the country so a lot of times we send our new or investment clients to other markets where we have a great a referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become real estate investors how do they tend to pay for these places\nDoes kind of range across the gamut but it reminds me of one specific young lady that I help she was about twenty four years old when she came to me\nWinds by her first investment property she did not have\nAmazing income but she had a fantastic credit in her case we did do the hard money route we bought the property for about sixty nine thousand dollars all and we were in for a total of eighty seven and she was able to turn that they ask for a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars making of a doubt\nWell it turned that being a for a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars making of a doubt a thirty thousand dollar profit after closing costs on her first investment which was for her about an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and fill up you just mentioned getting a hard money loan which is a private individual or a private group who fund the mortgage without the requirements that a major national bank would have to tell us how do you find a hard money loans\nWhile they're there actually are lots of different hard money lenders and for the audience out there that's not the only way\nTo accumulate properties outside of the traditional financing there is also portfolio but as far as the hard money loans it's really just about\nNetworking and finding other people that have done it we started group called the broker underground and the San Antonio area and it's been a great resource for over two thousand fulltime agents and brokers that share a referral such as\nHard money lone individual so we've got an entire list of different people as well as feedback from agents good or bad on how\nThe experience was for the consumer and for the agent working with that hard money lenders so again I think networking is is so key\nFor trying to find these individuals that become your business partners and I can help your clients\nFill up that is such great information so let me ask you if someone starts investing in real estate in their twenties what's that going to mean to their life and their financial security in the years ahead\nThere simply ahead of the game you know there's that old Chinese proverb that says the best day to plant a tree was Twenty years ago and the second best day is now\nWith the people that are older you know I mean for the people that are older\nAre thought to lake but does that got started in investing in their twenties there simply ahead of the game and they're going to be able to stop working for money sooner so that their money can start working for them\nNo ice I Love that will fill up by really appreciate you joining us on the show today and sharing your strategies your tactics and your techniques for investing in real estate thank you\nThank you so much David pleasure\nPhilip Becker realtor and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas and a millennial investor [noise]\nComing up on real

Eighteen\nSo yes\nI think he bought the property and like June and he had just graduated in may and his parents help them you know with a little bit of a down here because it was not that there could be financed graphic day or anything like that\nBut he got the financing on it though and he held a job through high school that show that good enough income to cover the payment and it was crazy by far the youngest\nThat is awesome\nAnd so when people come to you and they're very young and they say I Want to invest in real estate what did they tell you about the reasons why\nHonestly most young investors are looking to build a stable future which I think it's so encouraging right now because I you know our generation is is really good at all they wanting to do the things that they find fun and so I Love the fact that they actually\n... you know investing in real estate ... and ... and the hard work themselves as something fun\nActivity for them so I it's really encouraging for me\nSo if I Want to invest in real estate and by my very first property am I going to need you know a great credit be really solid reserves like money and the bank and see a really high income or not so much\nWell you know obviously life an easier one of those things are are there but it's certainly not something that should stop you from investing actually you know one of my my biggest investors I've been working lessons that first got my licence eleven years now he's built a very impressive that the guy\nHundreds of unit across the state of Iowa a little bit you know across the border in Illinois and a black guy and he bought his very first property on contract he ended up buying the property on contract from a landlord that was just tired of having every model every time a tenant moved out\nYou know you hate your carpet things like that\nPlan to rent it out and then felt like you know I put all of this however good I think that's how we try to sell it and you know it filled right away so that's where he got his very first nest egg to start going so he bought his very first investment property on on contract with I think if I remember I was something like three or four thousand dollar down with the owner financing situation and you just\nFelt from there so it's crazy what you can deal with a little bit of resourcefulness\nThat is awesome and among your clients are a lot of them young\nYou know what I Will say that you know I feel pretty diverse client base which I'm very proud of it at this point\nBut a lot of mine that isn't that the one that I was just telling you about that I've been working with for over eleven years you know he had been investing than the ... in his\nEarly twenties he's now forty nine and has built something that and I can do that or forty nine young especially that he'll he settled and you know he started in their early twenties and he hadn't stops and so I Would say good chunk of my that's definitely what I Would consider young\nSo let's look at the big picture a person comes to you in their twenties and they start investing in real estate tell me how is that going to change their life as the years\nThey tell me how is that going to change their life as the years pass\nI'm sure you've heard that the name of that and they get right context I understand the here but the beautiful thing about ... ... ... you make or at least that's the only one you know so if you can buy into something early if you can start building that ... and how you're paying your mortgage for you and building equity for you\nIf you can do that at a young age limit on what you can do because that person that that that that that that ... that that is something that you can can snowball and run in the down payment option for a bigger and and and just keep going and it grow exponentially in a way that you would never imagine on paper\nThat is great advice what Chris so I really appreciate you coming on the show today in talking about investing in real estate at a young age thank you\nAt All right thanks for having me anytime\nYou are very welcome ...

College Station Bryan\nYour biggest investment [noise]\nWe are back with our special show set for life\nAll about you your real estate and your financial security\nUp next let's talk about protecting your investment by making sure it's properly maintained\nJoining us as Tim ... president of the American society of home inspectors ... is the oldest and most respected non profit professional organization of home inspectors in North America and has more than eight thousand members Tim welcome to real estate today\nThank you glad to be here we're delighted to hear So Tim here we are getting into the fall season what should I Do first if I Want to make sure that my home is in tip top shape\nFirst thing I Would do is check your gutters and down spouse because the biggest issue with the homeless water and in the fall cutters get clogged up with leaves and other debris and need to make sure you keep those ... clean so the water gets removed away from the house you don't have any moisture and corrosion\nYou know that's a really good point okay so the gutters and down spouse bats where to start now what about the windows and doors what am I looking for there to him\nOr you want to make sure your windows and doors are caught concealed properly so the cold air doesn't get into the house [noise] make sure your windows function a lot of times people leave their screens in the windows and we tell people take your screens out storm for the winter because the ice and snow and\nSleet and hard cold weather can really take its toll on screen so we think that people that take their screens out\nSame thing was screen door's takers screened or screen out and put in your storm door\nSo what about the roof now how can I really know if my roof is in trouble or not what do I need a pair of binoculars\nOr you could use that that's true but I Would recommend contracting or a qualified roofing contractor and have them come out and inspect your rough they can let you know if there's any damage shingles that can also let you know how long you refer last what the estimated life as but again that's another place of water can get into the home\nThat's absolutely right now a lot of us think about getting the air conditioning system service before summer but is that another area that you should have inspected prior to the winner\nAbsolutely a lot of HVAC contractors have maintenance contracts where they charge you a nominal fee if you have both of those checked and so what they do\nIf they come out in the fall and they check your furnace and they come back out in the spring and check your air conditioner so that's a good thing to do every year and again it's a big safety issue or to make sure that this is functioning properly and efficiently also helps to reduce your heating bills gas or electric\nInteresting another area in the house that I Know is really important especially in the cold weather months is the insulation but Tim how does a homeowner inspect back\nSometimes that's difficult it's by staying in the walls\nBut at the addict people can get up there and they can now measure the insulation see how much they have in specific areas of the country\nYou have more insulation or less insulation so if you're up in Minnesota or main you'd\nProbably have more insulation and the addict than you would maybe in in Washington DC and Virginia the Carolinas because they don't get the cold weather like they do in the north so I Would strongly recommend having an installation contractor come out and expect that have all the investments you can make an hour insulation is one of them\nThat that have all the vestments you can make an al insulation is one of the best because even though you spend dollars insulating now you will get that back in lower air conditioning and heating bills\nInteresting now Tim obviously are shows on all over the United states some parts of the states are going to be warm and sunny all winter long while of course others will be covered with snow so are these fall prep strategies appropriate for your house no matter where it is\nAbsolutely and the fall if you're in a suburb of climate South Florida Arizona may what happier air conditioner checked again because during the summer months it really works hard almost twenty four seven so it's best to do that are both in the spring and fall and and he's warm weather climate\nBy having your furnace center air conditioner service in the fall or the winter no matter where you live I can say the homeowner money on their utility bills\nThat's very interesting because yes in the southern states people are going into a season in which they're going to continue to need their air conditioning even after this brutally hot summer we just went through\nThat's true very true\nWith him I really appreciate you joining us today and talking about maintaining your property thank you\nThank you and make it a great day\nYou to Jim thanks for joining us Tim bill

F. root zone key signing key the care K uh was updated for the first time since the U.N Security system was implemented in um plenty Ken\nShe's now what is all that well it it ... you know we've talked about the\nDNS it it's the it's the system that used to map a name you know like coast to coast am dot com for example to\nThe Internet I pay addresses which aren't necessarily always the same so this is a complicated hierarchical system that works its way down or up depending on how you look at it to a root\nZone where the where the core information is for much everything else close fourth\nFifth twenty pen that has been protected by um a a cryptic graphic system with a key that's been the same twenty pounds so they decided finally time to change that he was there a danger we could have gone down today well ... in fact\nThe the change over had been delayed for for I I think about a year because there were concerns that the the thing about the security system has not been widely deployed\nTo end users it's mostly the big ISPs and and big corporations and things like that it's gradually spreading more so there were concerns that not everybody especially not all of the all the highest paid with fairly have\nMade the right preparations for this there could be disruptive\nBut it was very carefully planned out in practice what happened is they they did the roll over\nA yesterday yesterday afternoon I guess yeah there were I guess if you're a little bit here and there but they were ready for that they uh they fix them and as everybody can tell the Internet is still

also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good go such as spirit guide as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks stores for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello to everybody around our whole planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring a ghost since spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividual in the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about\nAll things supernatural a good and evil are also in tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that that\nThere's a veil of energy that seem to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight and\nYeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth and this is a huge target for demonic spirit\nAnd also negative ... and I'll get into the difference between those who are as we go along but apps\nI'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power and can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there was never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike\nAt the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get you take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nA demonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counter part of angels\nThat powerful they are not regular people who have died just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not have lived in the physical realm for a long time are very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd ah we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the pack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and a demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round\nFrom the non physical route\nAnd actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better\nEquipped to ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can't see them and tell a path ethically trans for information\nInto our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other other people at ourselves to get us to do things we would not normally do and we can see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were you know positive spirits and their ego God's for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nAre so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits\nDo not have voice boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate ... kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness and they communicate on that level\nAnd they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in that's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all of violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and as an extra ... when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you they can they can come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect it when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work twenty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked a success if you times\nFor short to rations and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nDid you see them I can you ... I was\nBorn with the ability to seize spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school in grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with their school work in the summer are looking at me\nLike how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nOrange stay with us

talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren and their cribs ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can see them but they can see us they generate negative emotional energy if they generate hatred\nAnd they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today in order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do it don't want us to know that they're they're\nThey want us to think that if a Hollywood myth or something like that and how they would make great movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time\nWe just can't see them and they communicate with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business and you destroy a person's\nAbility to make money destroyed their family\nDestroy their lives\nAnd also ... change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they\nWant to sell they sure do ... and we have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWill do you have to realize that they're doing this to us\nAs opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a part of any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nThis by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would\nNot normally do that mhm and so\nOn were angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't\nKnow that there are there and they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not\nMost spirits are good summer not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and it is to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts at it they have weapons\nAre just experts added\nHave weapons they have devices that they make a lot of nonsensical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits changed their forms like our our parents die and it's an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating and thinking about generating\nA form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nNaked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred\nEnrage we think it's our own but it's not always completely our own\nOr the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular\nSpirit in charge of all negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other\nThey most often work alone but that's not always rule or they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this uh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families are getting them to fight\nUh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming um I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out or an attack I pull out my nonsensical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody is not so fortunate the vacancy them to know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die\nAll the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred and rage and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle it no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought it was horrible\nThey have they just have humans\nAnd so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on and a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other because we're being used\nAnd it's not just you know I heard some talk on the commercials about global elitist and all of that and I think all that's true but also we're being attacked by non physical entities\nWho wish to see the human race fail it was a possibility that\n\nYou've heard the news you heard the sports know read a review whatever we said we put it on line this is sixteen

movement that and then all of heightens little organ mass and then some other parts of masses ... scattered throughout so we're exploring kind of how that all evolved\nOkay and this is the curtain

words free concert here so already it's got a big plus sign\nBrief idea what this is I see the words free concert here so already it's got a big plus sign\nYeah so we're piggybacking on efforts are the ... valley Veterans Memorial or who is going to be having a dedication of a new world war one memorial ... passed away in ... park okay\nAnd so uh we'll be singing at that dedication but we decided to back up a little earlier in the afternoon and offer a free concert of a patriotic music as well as uh some selections of World War one arrow music\n... so we'll be doing that at the ... billion at two o'clock in the afternoon of armistice day\nAnd they are living in the actual dedication of the world war one that more will be at four pm which is a little bit after your costs you will

kind of songs uh there's backup your troubles in year old kid by okay some of those kinds of things so\nWe found some great music or that they put together from Great Britain really celebrating the

are you having some some small select groups break out and do some pieces during these are the upcoming concerts\nFor uh\nOur first concert we'll have our our chamber singers will be doing some special selections during that ... uh for the armistice day program um will have a large group early and then for the actual dedication will pare down and just do a smaller group for that\nOkay so when we talk about the smaller group coming out for the ah October thirteenth concert about how many selections and how many people would be my next question\nUh we have a an audition group out of the corral called the chamber singers right and that's about a four persons per section oh okay so uh we have five sections for this we have plenty of singers and that group right now\nThat's not bad should make pretty good sized town of course in a place like first Presbyterian you want to have a decent sound 'cause it's a big space to fill with sound\nAlthough the acoustics in there I as I recall I been in there once for music and you know I've shame on me I should have been there more but I've been there once and I remember that wherever I was in the place the sound was very full and you didn't get you didn't lose this out anywhere inside\nThat is correct or the acoustics are wonderful and in fact there are some people that I Know that like to sit in the balcony at the very far back of the church because there are just super and that's where rods in a yeah records\nFrogs going to say that's usually where the microphones are finally when we get to play some stuff back that's

[noise]\nSo we decided many years ago to say what would it look like for us to have a media free day on Sundays to say no phones\nNow occupy them this is this happened for me and him one of those moments at home where I noticed it was really quiet\nAnd I looked up over the top of my laptop and I thought to kids on devices I saw my husband on his laptop and realize the other two kids were downstairs watching TV it wasn't one of those sweet mama moments where you're pedaling with your kids or you just finished reading the story it was one of those what are we all doing\nWe're all in the same house and yet we're not connected are you a main mom it is my kids least favorite part of this whole spiritual read them I mean we are the meanest parents in the world because we still do it ended I mentioned my children were my daughters were sixteen\nSo the other day they came home from church and of course they don't have their phones\nAnd this is they can barely survive without them because they could the fear of missing something they can be missing something someone might be trying to get a hold of them there so we used to being constantly notified notifications notifications notifications\nAnd they don't know what to do in their own skin with out that kind of a communication so Sarah my daughter says to me what are we supposed to do I I I don't know what to do and we're laying around on the couch is in the living room and I said well why don't you tell us the story\nAnd she said once upon a time there were two really mean parents he took away their kids found for no reason at all [laughter] and we all laughed and you know what happened we all fell asleep on those couches and and I woke up before everyone else and I looked out my sleeping children\n'cause they're that they're at their best right here when there we love to watch our kids sleep you know there are so beautiful and we cherish them and\nAnd I thought there's a reason that we're unplugging because we're tired we run so hard\nAnd our creator God knows us and he made us and designed for rest I mean\nIf he really wanted to get the point of cross he could put it in the days of creation maybe he could put it in the ten commandments maybe he could talk about it throughout the profits if he thought it was important oh wait wait and then where's that passage about Jesus being in a hurry\nYou know that one first about oh wait [laughter] yeah that's not a not one either Jesus did not take away the concept of arrest he did fulfilled the Sabbath it is not old mandated a law that it has to\nLook a certain way but he certainly did not come in a literary the concept that we were created to [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThey were created to rest because remember at creation God rest said on the

wrecked my life\nHere's a story it's dateline Austin, Texas my name is Neal and I'm a marijuana addict\nMy name is Neal and I'm a marijuana addict a year ago I wouldn't have said that because it would have meant giving up marijuana\nI Would rather have given up breathing when\nI had my first cup of coffee each morning I precious little button on my vape pen waited for the blue glow took a huge inhale and then blew it into the mugs so that I could suck you in the THC and the caffeine at the same time then I took another hit and another\nIn the afternoons ... bowl or papa gummy bear or both that by the way it's not the kind of gummy bears that you'd normally give to children at night I got high before eating dinner\nOr watching the ball game maybe I've stopped getting stoned a little bit before bed but what was the point if I went to bed high I could wake up high too like most pot addicts in denial\nI spent the years telling myself that marijuana isn't addictive and so I didn't have a problem but clearly I did\nAnd I'm not the only one who suffers this way\nNo marijuana diction isn't deadly like opioid addiction or toxic like math addiction it's still wastes millions of lives\nAround nine percent of even casual users become addicted\nAnd about Seventeen percent of those who start as teenagers\n\nOkay something worried about these statistics that he's using those statistics are based on an article that was published\n... might be eight or nine years ago but it's it's an article published in the journal of the American Medical Association spin looked over its been peer reviewed it is a solid article and the solid analysis here's what they show that if you take\nThe total number of even occasional marijuana use is if you take people who take even\nOne joint getting high once nine\nPercent of those people that's many many millions of people will become addicted to marijuana that means that they're dependent on it that means you have to struggle to quit that means you have a need your body develops a need for marijuana\n\nHe says I started smoking meaning marijuana regularly in the Nineteen nineties when I was in my mid twenties\nSo he didn't have that Seventeen percent nearly one out of five people who start using pot as teenagers become addicted he says I started\nSmoking regularly in the Nineteen nineties when I was in my mid twenties pot made everything better\nFood music sex cleaning and it made nothing worse I got the press less often I left all the time sounds great huh well he goes on\nBut it also lost my temper for no reason did I yell strangers in public probably I barely remember because I was stolen all the time\nBut I Do remember that once high as a promotional blimp I got into a bar fight with a former friend and broke his tooth with a beer bottle\n\nBack when my writing career was booming I got invited a couple of times to do readings in Amsterdam a bad gig\nFor a plot addict ones after ingesting a couple of THC pills I dumped a pitcher of water over my head and shoulders the Iraqi representative to national poetry day Amsterdam\nAnother time I pull down my pants and flashed a crowd of several hundred if I had any boundaries we'd all raised them thoroughly\nThe boom and my writing career ended fast\nTotally consumed by a chilling last for power I'm Pam who south Fox News President Trump leveling that charge against Democrats in a political rally in Kentucky\nDemocrat Joe open\nSource of deadly drugs were first guy [noise] Democrat have become the party of crime\nThe president firing up a crowd enrichment last night were hotly contested congressional races underway House Republican Andy bar is facing a challenge from Democrat Amy McGrath a retired Marine fighter pilot but part of the rally\nDinner even if their body mass index is normal according to the national study on aging at mid life it takes more effort to heat wave trend because of shifting hormones cause astro weight to settle in the middle so if your way to measure thirty five inches or more\nYou're going to need to work out two to three twenty minutes strength training sessions\nTo provide your weekly exercise regime preserve your lean muscle mass and rev up your metabolism you need to eat a daily servings of omega threes and salmon walnut some flaxseed\nNeed to get twenty five percent of your daily calories from healthy fats if you were a healthy weight team so a study in the journal of pediatrics followed a hundred and thirty seven African Americans from birth to age twenty eight and found that being overweight at aged fourteen increases your risk of developing type two diabetes in adulthood\nKind of applicators you'll need how many treatments you'll need and then we get you can use scheduled for your session with one treatment you'll see about a twenty percent reduction in the south where\nOkay now I haven't done a couple of weeks ago mhm but nothing looks any different yet\nRight so what we do with coal sculpting is and we go in and we phrase those fat cells\nAnd that actually causes the cells to go through sell debt so it does take your body awhile to process all of that dead tissue and eliminate it from your body naturally so you should start seeing results about four weeks after your first treatment\nAnd then full results will be about three months after will that fact\nNo so the fact that we treat is permanently gone and typically we do not reproduce any fat cells so once we ... it is permanently eliminated from your body however the fat cells that we have left\nDo have the capability to grow kind of like the way that balloons do can expand and come back so it is always important to maintain your diet and exercise routine whatever that maybe this is not just for moms this race for dads teenagers yet what kind of\nFat or we're getting rid of where it is the ... fat that is on the outside of the muscles so we just referenced it as that ... fat\nBecause the system works as like a vacuum section if you can pinch and squeeze your fat than it is called scope double\nThat yes we do see males females they see a lot of older people I Do see a lot of younger people\nReally anyone can get cool sculpting which is the nice thing about it\nSure now this is not invasive so that means I was cool sculpted and I was back to work that afternoon right yeah so that's a nice thing about political thing is you don't really need to take time off there's absolutely no down time and no restrictions everything's your comfort level so like you I got called cooked in the morning and then I went to work in the afternoon\nEverything's really to your comfort level the only thing I Do tell my patients is drink a lot of water\nOther than that there's really no restrictions okay women come in here tell us the park's not ... not everybody has a C section issues whether it's right or issues so we do a lot of um we do abdomen interests eyes out or size we can do the love handle area\nAmong a lot of women that back bras ... just because the way your profits does kind of push some sat down\nAnd we can do under arms chicken because even though I'm a little bit about under our chin yeah Retta oh yeah definitely we can definitely go back and all the men were the issues and the spots on guy\nI typically see men um come in for the love handle area is just a place that they um develops out there and in addition it can kind of help\nShape them so they get more of that like swimmers body shape more narrow at the waste a minute ... looks really good after men hold their weight in their ... yes so the challenge with men um is they do typically carry their fat behind\nThe muscle so if you are looking at close sculpting am if you\nHave a pretty solid abdomen it probably means that you're carrying your fat behind the muscle\nAnd it means that our machine wouldn't be able to suction that sat at the basically what we're doing is putting those machines on they so yeah and the fat up into the machine a little bit so they kind of squeeze you yeah it ... it comes up about two inches and that's just so not only did we get a good grip on the fact that it's to separate it from all of the\nImportant Oregon's and to issue so that nothing really gets damaged and then that status frozen oh yeah it's frozen solid I'm so after your session we do a little massage on it to break up that fat and just make it easier for your body to flush it out\nAnd like I said does take some time for your body to process that so you won't see results for about\nA month after when I came in here I I gave you my kind of run down and you gave me before and after after pictures you showed me how I could look for other people yet\nAre based on other pictures yeah there may be multiple treatments it after the first three months I may still say I want to look better\nSo am I always recommend coming in for consultation um because we definitely customize your treatment to your body some people need more than two treatments you may need additional treatments on just one side\nEverybody carries their fat different so we really want you to come in so we can customize a plan and agree on what would be realistic goals and I want to show you know before and after ...\nAnd agree on what would be realistic goals and I want to show you know before and after pictures of people with similar body type so you can see what it would look like with one treatment with two treatments and so on\nI Know this is advertising larger markets are there are billboards in Houston and Dallas at say goal sculpting it looks like everybody's getting it done right you're they're really the best kept secret here in town\nYes so it is a lot more popular in larger cities I think smaller towns are just starting to even find out that political thing exists and it is one of those things that does sound like it's too good to be true that you can permanently phrase away your fat but we are getting more and more people finding out it definitely does work\nAnd I could you know I've had it done I can speak on that and it really is just such a simple way to get rid of fat you know it in you know instead of liposuction or tiny tax it's\nA lot less aggressive well and it's gonna take recovery time for me was that they can't be out of town and work and and people can't really take six weeks off to recover from major surgeries like that\nSo the nice thing is is like you can just go straight to work the next day and there's really no issues All right this little help our clothes fit better that is the big ... so and the fat we treat doesn't really weigh a lot so you won't really see a change on the scale so much but you'll notice that your clothes fit differently you'll probably lose inches instead of pounds\nAnd if we want a consultation how do we do that's correct yes so you can just give us a call and messages on our website I\nAm and you'll come in and what that point we will kind of go for how everything works giving you a personal evaluation and customize a plan and then at that point and we can give you an accurate quote for what all about the cops\nAnd it's just something we can do time and time again if we want to work on different spots they don't have to have it all at once yes so I work with people schedule as if we want to break it up for times that were better for you you want to do it all in one day\nAnd even if you want to come back for additional treatments will kind of schedule a timeline of how that will work out

Sunday flies up in our eyes are not sure what to do with it what are your suggestions so if it\nFeels like there's something that's Sloane into the like the best thing to do is to flush the eyes\nTo make sure that we get it out and then follow up with your prime my primary care doctor\nI'm as soon as possible of course if it's something\nMore severe than yes in those situations going to the emergency room would be appropriate\nBut when it all possible you want to see your doctor and the reason why is that your eye doctor has the equipment needed to be able to actually see what's going on in there and the tools so that if something needs to be pulled out of the pie\nIt happened saw a ... month exactly are we can warriors sometimes are\nGrinding metal and even if they're wearing a protection a piece of metal gets into their line it needs to be pulled out and it's not something that you want to wait for especially the costs\nAnd people don't realize that Ross and so I moved inside the guy so if that happens not only do we need to take out the piece of metal but we need to take out the rest as well and it's more info well I ... the senior practice\nSo we'll see people who've gotten abrasion scratches in the rye and will cause of that well sometimes is little babies scratching their mothers eyes their hands are flying everywhere right sometimes it's kids playing with\nToys in a way that\nDangerous to get their eyes scratched its weekend warriors during\nA DUI projects\nIt people just blowing their grass and something gets kicked up into their eyes so there can be all kinds of reasons sometimes that construction workers should have something happen now on the job I'm I've seen\nSomebody who they were placing ceiling tiles at work and the little piece of something fell into their online it needed to be pulled out me they'll pull it out yourself\nHow would you even do that I I Can't even imagine our fellow with the able to do\nThat uh I I Can't\nTell you but but there are oil to it because you're more likely to do more harm than good and then what we do after\nWhatever it is pulled out is we prescribe antibiotics will typically give a bandage contact lens from the pain\nAnd is now and again you get a bandage\nContact lens mhm the cornea has a ton of nerves and that's why even if you get the smallest little rape on your eyes it feels ten times worse\nSo at a contact lens could be used as a bandage to cover those nerves so that people are in pain wow yeah yeah um\nI Do want to to warn you though don't just automatically go into sticking contacting your eyes without seeing your eye doctor because if it's something like a severe bacterial or fungal infection or viral infection\nSticking a contact on your own I Will actually make things worse than we got to figure out what's actually going on before we do that\nAnd then if the abrasion as severe enough we may actually go and put an antibiotic membrane on the ice to help facilitate selling a cellular re grows\nWild so there's a lot that we can do to further damage our own eyes\nWe just need to call here please yeah a lot of times we can harm our eyes were a cat they think I Would think\nYes depending on how much scarring has happened can uh and it's it's a faction depending on how severe it is yes um you can end up with permanent\nBlindness said the best thing is when you have something happened in it addressed immediately don't wait a couple of days to just see oh maybe it will feel better let us take a look for you okay give us a phone number that we can

Would take it that way\nUm so so ... that's where you can either do individual ones or you can do a they're a fondness of ever pays or even trust like a thing on the other thing\nAt the same thing with real estate that called in real estate investment trust there are many different kinds their retail on their office for their health care rates hotel rates many different cuts you can't use on the four to five percent range on that was their\nInterest sensitive so interest rates go up and go down when interest rates go down and I go up so just realized that the nature of the thing is there's another way to do it with real estate\nWhich are called secured real estate Tottenham where they don't go up and down the price of a share stays at ten dollars a share and therefore you don't have to file 'til they they would have in a week or about swimming partnership there's a website for that which is secured real estate tons dot com and its pays an\nMe when did any\nIncome levels the the people demanding everything they ... they said binging even keep\nTrack of that enough and\nMuch when it gets even saying that putting somebody outside but keeping the bank at zero percent\nThen losing it as\nA people need to be saving I Would say the first place to be saving wouldn't be a rough IRA\nBecause that money is going on forever and you take it out tax free or you have to have earned in time and there's some I think it's about a hundred and thirty thousand a year in income which you can't do it rather but if you're under that do that fifty five hundred\nFor underage fifty sixty five hundred and fifty as they might put into per year in a rough I write\nAnd then you can earn money from a ... or you can\nRoll over money for four one K. once you leave a job and so that's like going there thanks for having him when he got tax free forever\nOh my gosh yeah yeah yeah yeah now do you ever had I had sent me an email with another great idea you know that what I Want to talk about 'cause I have a lot of Brian K fall into this category there I'd say downturn ordinary to break things in common and and they know how to get out\n[noise] correct for driving around underwater they have a criminal for rich okay to go like like\nFall a lot quicker\nThan the state that you get a new car you drive around the shower room\nAnd you just lost five thousand dollars on one second about Syria parents parents' hands\nBut you know didn't go down at all and\nI went to go slowly so a lot of people took on much bigger cars that can really afford the payments are killing him during his delinquent things in the fall and the last year because people are way behind and so that's something you can do you\nHave your own either to a lower interest rate\nOf change the maturity\nTo make the payment more affordable than a free website that\nThose dot com I Alone at ... dot com Milo GM dot com and you go in there and you put in how much you earn alone what you're paying for this many Mormons have to go the interest rate and then it says okay it's going to give you like\nAnd forth you choose a payment\nIt for example you're five\n\nDon't have insurance\nOr for you and you choose the payment and if you like\nYou're going to have the repo man coming in the middle of the testing your car way that's\nA fun experience wow okay no I tried the ... the main highly\nFor your business once you get out of one particular little\nCould make it interesting they got into trouble because the lenders are much more lenient now in giving people car loans and the reason is they put these so called defeat devices in the car and if you don't make your payment Debbie they can disable your car\nRight on the highway car does turn you know remote place and\nBuy the GPS I Know exactly what your car is setting us up to take\nYou away so my dying because of\nThat the lenders feel it's much easier to repossessed cars and therefore they made loans to people in the past might not have gotten Carlin because now that can trace 'em in the old days you know you had all these we've come and chasing around the block to try to find your car to get\nYour your your car as disabled as by GPS had no idea why they they know exactly where to go take a\nGuy yeah that no no longer in the room when these guys are pretty reputable I mean right now doing this on line that that's certainly okay yeah I mean you\nKnow these are and you know major credit unions around the country that are competing for Europe is going\nOkay perfect we also talked about one of the thing you said a life insurance\nYou know life insurance he may well I I think people get the wrong time will be because I don't know what they're buying or their mind what they can afford and then in the age where I found out more now that may yet I'm quitting or they can't afford it and they let a lab\nCorrect your what do we do for that so\nIs under those circumstances you can sell your life insurance policy in what's called the wife settled the market for literally hundreds of thousands of dollars so if you let your policy laps you want to leaving a hundred thousand dollars on the table\nAnd again the insurance company is never going to tell you that\nThat we have to tell you about mortgage optimization 'cause I didn't want the insurance company would love\nTo have you lapse about say they've received premiums for you for many years and never have to pay you with that\nBecause right now so you get a policy for a million\nSomething like that that say your Seventy five\nAnd you've got a heart condition or something like that and uh the premiums going up every year you can't really afford them you're normally laps but if you win lifestyle in markets you may be able to sell ... million dollar policy for like three hundred thousand dollars you get the three hundred thousand now the people who buy the policy\nTakeover the premiums that become the beneficiary and\nThey've tripled their money but I don't know\nBe so actually the older you are and the second you are the more money you going to get\nPeople on the top I think you're not going to stick around to long actually write write their their way for people who are retired\nWe have this fantastic assets that they don't even know that they just let it collapse of the cases now let me give you a website where people can\nFind out about that it's called something\nHave you in the eye of the funding wine\nOf life insurance policy so in this case your listeners would be the seller I'm a policy a fine by there's more bias on there are sellers insurance companies all kinds of people want to buy these policies because I Know in the long run they're going to\nAnd then they take a year you know a few of them won't go off and they made themselves a lot of money so this is something that a lot of people that got an asset that don't even know they just let slip away\nAnd the insurance companies have to happen to have taken their payments for many years on and let him go getting funding life dot com website just to see and since free\nAnd you can kind of get an evaluation new you go to them and they say I've got a million dollar policy and I'm Seventy five and I've got a heart condition and you know how much can I get for it so before you move ahead though can get a good sense of what the market for that particular politics\nThe older you are the more you're gonna get sick or you are the more you're gonna get\nWow okay so what is it for a private person you were like we want to get in the head of that business that sounds like a grain that came we work with those companies or I did something that we really need to be a hadn't said forget the\nWell most of the buyers are institutions playing catch them and even facts but I mean he individuals\nCan buy up the thing about being an individual is if you have your money on an individual policy you'd have to wait for that one person to die\nDon't want the hedge fund that let's say might have\nThousand both died so at any particular year whatever five or ten of them are going to die and they'll there'll be a big payoff so by\nBeing diversify it works as an individual you don't particularly want to be waiting for one person to die whatsoever together\nNow to right now anyway more about ... and again Mary interesting individual become very background that you just don't see very often like you've got the Nobel Massey or money guy that's got to be an interesting reading people's sing comparably know what kind of money person may in our\nRight so when they type I talk about the six different personalities that people have and how you can understand the financial decisions you make\nBased on the kind of personality you may be the thing that I won't go into detail I thought the book does but the personalities are us drivers high rollers coasters auspicious squirrels and debt desperadoes that's my six foot though\nThere there's a reason why are typically the way you were brought up either you may be the same as your parents or maybe the opposite for example a lot of people whose parents grew up in the depression the\nParents have squirrels they're very very airbase catchers they remember\nWas stirring a\nUp in the in the much more prosperous time the kids may be high rollers\nParents are from the ... is from where you want the depression times\nIn the same as your parents but sometimes you react to your parents or the opposite based on the economic conditions or other with the paper\nWhat is the new law so like if you buy a house who by we live in it you love it\nWhat are some of the things that they can do without them be reading model to make it look clean and fresh for somebody that has been in the market for a few years they're not even going away clean and fresh me right\nNow I agree with you in a lot of the properties that are turning right now or even over the ten year mark so they're really if they have not been touched their really outdated at this point and trends have changed so much for the past ten years that buyers are really a stickler for wanting something new you know as far as\nThe stage is concerned utilizing a from like ours that has the staging specialty but also the interior design aspect we can come in as a full service from for you and give you a color consultations as to what his own trend and what buyers are looking for but we can also address\nAnd scale and declaring any personalize things so we really can assist you with even light cosmetic touches that you can make and very\nUm reasonable value and cost to you as a seller I'm\nPain is one of the cheapest and most beneficial things you can do to a home even if it's painting just that trend to give it a fresh life\nOf Paul Ryan but then also um you know making sure that the furnishings that you have are\nAlso up to date and neutral someone if we don't have the most expensive and and I'm thinking expensive doesn't always mean great writing of a very expensive chair and it's really al ... and you could ...\nSimple ... or so you weren't magic with\nOr you're working in our office you've done it for my home just a nice touch and that really bring across the clean\nUp today personality yeah so if\nWe come in and assess the home and we actually provide you with the seeking consultation and by the way we've got some really inexpensive and ... why\nPackages available for those who really don't want to spend a lot of money with a dating company and they have the ability and the time to do it on their own we can provide you with what we call ... where we kind of a sudden and our of our time with you and your realtor and we give you an honest feedback\nCome up with a consultation plan for you I'm full an email and you can apply it um during the last hundred dollars okay hum and\nBut it but to have that outside I that as I'm an\nExpert in the way that the buyers are actually seeing the market right now um is it worth the money and it again it's really an inexpensive way to assess your home before listing it um it's just\nAbout the value is it's going to come back to you in temple\nBut we also work with a realtor on his style and shoes so literary name professional photography has become\nCommonplace in this town you used to be able to take a cell phone pictures and ... and that was acceptable and and these these days and ages you gotta have professional photography even aerial and drone photography becomes a huge so I'm the\nBuyer is expecting to look at the listing on line or um\nYou know with their realtor and see perfection before they even walk in the front door right so we were with their current photographer that the real estate agent works with or we have our own and we will come in and actually style\nAt home before the photo shoot and then we provide you with the professional photography afterwards for your listing and that's really important for people who want to list on their own without a real estate agent or those that don't have\n'em and they're real estate agent also doesn't have the time to start with them before right does\nAnd that's as simple as we can actually remove a chair from a ram style it take a picture put the chair back in the room you know it's really all about the initial impression of the lifting and voted to safety\nWell people are looking at things on line now and so then they look at forty listings close\nFor and they have a lot when they have on on line and then they tell her you know and I want to go see these three home wreck will they narrowed it down reading ... you've gotta made a big hit on line\nCorrect and it matters that were that the the voters are shown enlisting if they if the virus can get a true representation of the layout of the home with the ordered that the pictures are presented that makes a huge difference to you know they want to see you walk in the insurance and then the living in the dining in the kitchen before they ever go to a veteran\nSo that makes a big difference too and again I copy and color is really good but you want to present when they get their neutral pallet I can and that's\nWhy the style and she is so important is an important aspect of our business that we offer\nAnd we can come combined those with a walk and talk so again your investment in\nStaging at that point is still very minimal and then we can discuss if you need us more on a half a day or a full day occupied from staging a use of our time and that is going to be the glittering personalizing rearrange furniture taking them out on adding pieces of decorum versus if we need to supplement the kinds of things\nNow you have another business for you good properties ready to to be rented so you can actually help us if we need to Hugo painters she's got four\nPeople you've got things to do to help us write so we don't know those people and he said I'd love to look\nAt your home and with in order to do that get ready for ... we're going to have a paint on Tunisia replaces carpet you got people to help us\nCorrect and I actually provided that I'm the type of a bidding estimation with turn key being the source of\nThe um subcontractors and it's actually worked out well for a lot of my clients because I Do so much book during the summer turn especially that I have\nI Do so much book\nDuring the summer turn especially that I have subcontractors that will work for me at a very reasonable price and they do a really great job on my expectation of quality is really high with turkey so I make sure that it carries on into anything I Would do from the stage point of view and for my clients with\nThe state right now because I don't know who to call the to switch out maybe the hardware on certain things or of the things I wouldn't even know like where do you find a handyman if you've never use one and and you're in the solution to that correct\nAnd I can help facilitate it schedule coordinated follow up on the job of your project manager so that you don't have to do that as a homeowner you've got enough going on with getting your house ready to sell and probably working and families and those kind of thing\nSo um the stage can handle a certain aspect and then turn he can also help with any type of paint carpet during a counter tops\nUm light cosmetic remodeling that needs to be done\nAnd we'll give you a fair and honest estimate and we would always encourage you um if you'd like to get more than one estimate generally compare pricing with others but it is nice that from and the point of view of a buyer and the point of view of a cellar that it's all done under one house and a lot\nEasier to coordinate and work with one person or are they all that stuff done\nWhat are some of the mistakes that we make outside or how can you give us a a drive of opinion of as well they all the\n... sure yeah absolutely so any talk of overgrown Bush's have got to be cut back on simple\nLandscaping is the best if you can keep ingrained with some ... has a really good option and then learn in this climate roses are really beautiful but they're hard to maintain\nSo if you don't have a green thumb a six year it may not be the best flower for you um but I always keep with what's in season at the time you left your home and consult with an ex sugar landscape architect or even just stay grounds crew that has a ... you know the ability to hit again\nFlowers and you know in all the time and do all these great big country clubs and things like I always said how right they can always held and I'm always\nCut your grass you know have your direct ... and maintained and beautifully edge because of the first one Russia and like you're saying is the\nOf lifting um but then the second impression is driving up to the house and I personally as a buyer myself in previous years and have driven up to a house looked at my real estate agent said\nNope onto the next one\nRight now I wouldn't even go in because it just should not look like it had been a wealth of making home and so why even go in at the home\nWith them maintain for next year they're going to assume that the interior also it's\nAn idea what to say well what if we have to move out of town well you're going to hire a landscaper to come in and mow every single week I mean you can have that done right further you are not in your region can help you do that and you have to do that to\nAbsolutely and again that's a reasonable um investment for you to make if\nYou really are serious about selling your home and if you're motivated than you'll do those things in order to keep your property\nI'm well kept and it's so much easier for your agent to promote their homes to other agents and online\nIf it if they know from week to week and showing showing that it's going to look the same and so hiring and cleaning crew is um just for even a short period of time if you don't utilize them afterwards that's fine for hiring a cleaning crew hiring along crew for making sure again that\n... is clean they will notice called labs they will notice\nCeiling fans that are dusty um they will notice grimy doors and and I put it\nYou know they may not live like that either right now right when they by and they're going to spend that big they\nWere talking to loan amounts of numbers to them all day long and they're paying interest for points\nAnd they want the best friend but rather the lives in before or not doesn't matter what they want to live in their mind needs to be that the that absolutely it's surveys investment it ... it's probably one of the businesses are making their and I live in a life that once they get there I got but that doesn't matter to\nThem I mean I Want to buy the best that I can afford to buy and try and that's all really looking\nAnd when you have a forty percent increase in listings over the previous year and the ... market than you really have a lot of competition that you're that you're buyer has access to and the median price hasn't really changed all that much since last year so they still feel like\nKeeping up his campaign blitz this is Fox News

I could go on forever and ever and ever about his movies are that you know he uses firearms and well they're just all of them\nYou know he got to be a tough guy remember ... one of his big slogans that he used was was girly man he's used to use the joke and say only ... don't be a girly man there'll be the girly man and this was something a used when he ran a in two thousand four\nFor governor of California when he ... he would start to say he would talk to the Gurley men don't want to watch out for the girly man outlets and we've seen it many times before that he um\nIn center in late Saturday Night live even used it to you remember the the characters and see if I remember off the top of my head I'm a I was ... and we had Dana ... and\nOh boy boy a brain block 'em but they were they were ... and they were here to pump you up and they would call everybody on their a girly man a girly man now\nYou know I don't know Schwarzenegger stole it from one or or SNL stole it from a you know sports in ... but he used the term girly man when he was talking about the Democrats that he was running against and the Democrats in the California state legislature and you know whether it be the the the house or the senator\nHe also said that he was going to terminate them remember how I'm going to terminate them I'm a ... or the girl him out and they don't do anything to terminate them that was a Arnold Schwarzenegger's\nCampaign slogans camping campaign speeches when he was out there in I'm In California running well you see what's going on we just saw the\nThe brutal attacks against a justice now justice Kavanaugh we saw that happened we've seen them against our president and how you know he'd tougher to get you know it didn't push them often well now Arnold Schwarzenegger is is it is turn now he is now apologetic\nFor using the Gurley mental he says at the time it felt like the right thing to do it was in my gut I improvised and I called them girly man because they weren't willing to take risks\nThey were afraid of everything politicians in general want to do little things so there's no risk we involved\nI'm Sorry I probably should have done that in the accent you know remember maybe next time I'm he said it was a short sighted in the long term it's better not to say that because you want to work with them so now he's coming out that ah the whole the whole girly man are you saying girly man is\nIs is demeaning he shouldn't have said girly man because it's it's offensive really means offensive did this is a guy that carried\nHim a machine guns and and and blue people up and he was the Terminator and he ripped heads off and you know memory to people with knives that came out of his hands\nAnd he's and he says\nYou're girly man I'm going to terminate you and now he's apologetic for it he's apologetic for using these terms\nWhat has happened what is going on out there in California\nWhy are these people turning crazy or you know listen we know that the Schwarzenegger is no fan of the Republican Party anymore he when he became the governor out there he started as a Republican and by the end of his term he was pretty much a Democrat he was one of the worst things to ever happen to gun control in a in in California out there he's he's he was horrible horrible governor but\nNow he's apologetic and listen you know here's what you need to do\nI'm Sorry ... you need to man up you'll be respectful of women you'd be respectful of everybody around you and you don't have to worry about these things you don't you don't you don't talk trashed anybody shouldn't be talking trash do doesn't matter if it's man or woman the women this applies to you to you why all of a sudden we have to apologize for things that happened twenty Thirty years ago it's absolutely horrendous\nIt's absolutely ridiculous a ... and I won't do it and maybe that's why I get to keep getting thrown off the Facebook and Twitter but the you know because I I like to be string to the point\nMaybe it's the same in the car listen the kids are not a you know they're not of age they're still not a you know making adult decisions well obviously these bad guys you most of these bad guys are are are under age to these once they're finding with the guns are underage kids are\nUnder Seventeen or younger they they're being called these firearms and you know so maybe we secure um based on that we don't want criminal kids to get them now\nAnd you know so maybe we secure um based on that we don't want criminal kids to get them now I think it's our responsibility to make sure the firearms here whether that's in your home or in your vehicle and and really that's the number one thing is is not to leave him in your vehicle\nYou you know I did I folks I get it I understand I understand there's you know you pull into the post office and the sign says no firearms inside yeah\nOkay you gotta do what you got to do maybe there's a moment or two you have to leave it in there but you know what you don't leave you don't leave the gun you know it's late on the seat for somebody to grab through an open window it's it's a tough spot and we've all talked about it and we've all contemplated this before\nUm so so I I under I understand that but you need to\nBe to take this responsibility serious I say if you leave that fire him in your vehicle that you need you mean not to you need to bring it in you need to make sure it's secure there's plenty of ways to secure the vehicles they have these little a little you can get a little you know done box like a travel case you know for when you're taking your gun on a plane you ever wonder why those come with the cable in them\nThat's where you can wrap it around the base of the seat and then put the table in the lock inside the case when you walk the case so if you had to leave a gun in your vehicle for you know let's say it was a you know storage at an airport or you're going into you know one of those gun free zones those federal buildings and you can't have it in there that's the way to do it\nMight be promised this was going to tie in the ... ... yeah I did I did I did tiny had a conversation with the president or over the past couple of days where he said the problem is not\nGuns the problem is illegal guns and I want to clarify something with ... with ... set of their ... illegal guns are they're illegal guns shorter Arthur's guns that have had the serial numbers altered to them there's guns that are\nYou know you have been altered to be short barrel guns or you know machine guns guns have been altered and such a way where they no longer meet the lawyer sawed off shotguns that kinda stuff\nThose are illegal guns or you know I'm going to bet that's you know you know two three percent of all the firearms it out there the will be these ones that are being seized in ... you know and you had collected from law by law enforcement\nIt's not illegal guns it's it's criminals having guns does that make the gun illegal I don't know maybe maybe I'm just it's semantics maybe it's just a play on words here a respect for ... for what he's doing and he's obviously standing up for his community a which is our community folks you know where we're all Americans here but they're not illegal guns there there\nThat he's talking about uh their their guns that are\nStolen they're they're victim guns really is what they are these are guns that have been you know they become victims of crimes themselves if a gun can be a victim of a crime that said it's been stolen\nIt's been handed around it's been used in crimes remember the gun doesn't have any any conscious it's you know it's it's what it does is determined by the operator by the handler so these are these are criminals using guns illegally which is what I really think on you're meant to say there or you know maybe maybe I'm reading in it to look into it too much and we can just call them illegal guns but there is a class\nOf illegal firearms out there and those are the ones that like I said that have been altered of every you know serial number scratched often you know been damaged by\nAh by the criminals to make them a you know the you know hidden from their true purpose you hear it or cause them to have another purpose of getting turning a regular rifle into a machine gun which by the way it's not just filing a pin that's that's movie nonsense but there are ways to do it if you get the proper tools um don't do it\nDon't do it illegal that's that's what I'm saying you but but but ... thank you for bringing this up that the majority of the problem out there with these firearms that have been taken by\nCriminals it's these criminals using these firearms illegally uh and that's
