or something and um\nIt turns out I guess in the year two thousand carrying and maybe you've heard this maybe you didn't but she brought sexual or ... accusations against somebody else in memory and completely out of line so she's got a history of making this sort of allegation and and it not really having happened\nAnd and now as you said there's an anonymous what did I say oh you weren't here friday when I said was\nWhen fleet fleet doubt I said mark my words there will be more allegations now yeah and even night you had an allegation from the daily mail\nThat somebody who went to Yale with him so that he drink too much into a drink all the time he was lying that he didn't drink as much now there's some other guy who's a professor in North Carolina says oh yeah oh so the basketball

that once the left got what he wanted which wasn't an investigation guess what happened today in Washington DC or carry and Brett Kavanaugh wasn't involved\nWith that first day of the Supreme Court nah around eight eight justices only eight justices yep a Brett Kavanaugh should be on there he's supremely qualified um these allegations are easily refuted but now you got to make a misdemeanor guy\nAnd let me tell you something they're hanging there having the fact that he showed up angry the other day\nIf somebody accused your brother or your husband to these things wouldn't they be this angry\nI mean yes of course\nSo the idea that he raised his voice and get angry because his poor family is being put through the ringer\nThat to me it would have been ridiculous\nHad he not been angry miserable life does if he's not a grassy not even angry somebody turned me without any angry\nThat he shows up angry said look how angry is probably drunk probably drink some beer before he came into

and dropped into the middle of the jungle what I was Nineteen years old\nWell Richard Nixon ... so what was the problem with with Nixon\n... mix and I wasn't going to put on the uniform and sacrifice myself for his politics is\nHe didn't start worrying about it what do you what do you mean his politics he didn't start the Vietnam Conflict that was started mowing down at the Kennedy was there\nYes that's true absolutely I I well aware of Mr Nixon did not start a war right but he escalated and engaged in secret bombing\nAnd he ended the war he ended the he literally took us out of there\nWell ... and ... and what sort of manner we were we were chased out of there Joe\nOh we could have dropped a nuclear bomb there if we want to do he said enough is enough and got us out\nOr actually he was threatening to do the very same thing you just said\nYou have a ... I'm not sure I understand it Paul what part of he got us out are you missing it wasn't Kennedy that got us out it wasn't Johnson that got us out it was mixing that got us out\nThat's true right away so you didn't have a problem with John somebody at a problem with Nixon\nYes\nThat's interesting about all we can talk for two hours from if you go because I don't know what the hell you're talking about I have no idea why you would be on I don't get it you became a progressive but you did describe because of Richard Nixon and his policies on Vietnam okay it's a editing nine for one pack Joe ... dot com or coming right back\n... yeah [laughter]\n\n\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is complicated especially as to whether it begins to cool well one person sleep soundly the other is either freezing or way too hot bowling branch makers of the world's most comfortable sheets loved by three us presidents is offering luxury flannel betting for a limited time and bowling branch dot com\nThey're unbelievably solved warm and breathe the bull\nSo everyone stays the right temperature the flannel sheets coming fourteen studying patterns and colors\nYou're guaranteed to find a style you love plus you could try them for thirty nights risk free but whatever you do don't wait last year there flannel sheets sold out and just a few weeks so go bowling branch dot com today for fifty dollars off your first set of ... plus free shipping with promo code bags that's fifty dollars off\nStanding by his man nine lease ...

know we we listen to your show ones\nThat know are the ones that mattered and the way I feel\nYeah the other side of that technology has come a long way man I'm forty one years old and when we were kids I had a a a party you had to pick it up and see if the neighbor up the road was you know was on it and then you also\nYeah we had that to a boat that was early on I Can't remember how old I was where the party line where you hear someone else dialing or you know we were going to hear somebody on the other end and you know I I don't go far back as you know having to call center on the phone and saying uh give me film Lulu I mean that was way before my time but maybe their ...\nAnd I do go back to that I remember my grandma had one yet written regardless I'm just to put some weight and your sales you know out of it one person on there that says whatever yeah you you probably got a thousand less working steps out here that are listening\nOh I Know I Do I I Know I have a lot of people that listen I just\nI just wanted to make it clear though that when we do our shows when we produce these shows we spend nearly seven hours preparing the show we check our we we check our sources\nWe we make sure that everything you get is the honest are reporting that we can do our best to do and we give it to you and even when we do the supernatural stories where you the stories that are paranormal because they're fun to we certainly are getting people who have had credible experiences\nAnd and uh we we and that's where people say well I like we did the paranormal shows yeah so do I can find some credit for people to give us paranormal shows\nI'm not going to have anybody come on and say they've had some paranormal experience and not have any verification so I mean it's it's difficult sometimes to find the best paranormal shows but we do that as well because that's what we like to do I mean and I'd like to say you know one of my biggest inspirations\nLong John Mabel a art

of oldfield new show and ah we do it and we tried to make it new and interesting an old at the same time to sort of feels right\nRight that that educating and form in a way you say I'm biased to just stay in the middle there doesn't matter what Saturday you know the red side or the Bush doesn't matter right in the middle of it\nA conspiracy theory has no side and even though it may look it may make somebody look bad that doesn't mean they're all bad it just means that they may be getting near somebody they really shouldn't be getting near as only going to say\nVery appreciative of what you

so they can pretty much tell you know what is happening and if they have a you know these nano bites of these nano tech particles on bridges in on on some roads and stuff they can pretty much tell what needs to be salted what needs to be a\nYou know sanded for for snow I mean all this stuff is he's just like\nYou know ... there are some good points to it or they'll be able to work harder to

sat there\nAnd I know you can't you know then well how old you put a time limit on it you know that but you know I mean he kind of grabs it gets his attention gets in his face\nAnd then that's the end of it it's not like he sits there to the Yankees on it and move in his head around for\nThe end of that it's not like he sits there to the Yankees on it and move in his head around for you know like you said even longer than a full second\nWell and again if this is twenty even ten years ago nobody cares right nobody cares but nowadays and people are comparing it to like woody Hayes\nReally you're going to compare punishable player in the next and it's so it's so stupid and yeah jumbo and again it's coming from\nDifferent folks in this day and age you have to be upset about something right and you have to be outraged about something and so folks are wanting to bring that up and if another if another coach Tom Herman had done it I wouldn't have had a problem with it I think that's a lot less strange and kissing your players on the cheek\nI think that's a little weird so now he came back\nAnd had to amend his or add to his comment well so what Jim both said during the press conference if you haven't noticed jumbo talks very quickly yeah and sometimes he doesn't complete the sentence because his brain is running Ninety to nothing and so what he said was\nHe said I didn't rabbit I didn't jerk it basically what he was saying I I wasn't sitting there just pulling them right around like Chelsea was saying yeah but whenever he said I didn't grab it I didn't jerk it sounded like he was denying it right and it sounded like you said well yeah I didn't grab a space mass which is not\nWhat he meant but that was tweeted out and lots of people picked it up and like we have we have video evidence so hell on earth you saw that and so then he had to come back in ... case but it was good I think that he came back and did that because it shows that he's willing to\nUm you know even in this day and age and granted I I Do agree that the ridiculous and this of it but he's willing to to clarify things and make sure that all the teaser cross and I's are dotted if\nThat could well so if you're an aggy fan I think you have to appreciate that sure I agree so they are the president's out on the road again you know when he goes out and we always get him uh he gets he gets people all worked up so yeah Tennessee\nPresident Trump in Johnson City Tennessee didn't take long to stress the mid term election a little more about a month away\nEverything\nAlso hitting his opponents for their treatment of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nSays the very first was announced\nHe criticized Democrats for wanting a longer FBI investigation on Kavanaugh but a frequent target of the president democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said and Monday Night comments that are full and fair investigation here's what Americans deserve grown all Scott Fox news\nYeah and as far as that stuff goes now um\nThey'll do this thing called cloture which is when they say okay we've debated this thing enough and it's a that's a vote that will be called by Mitch McConnell who's the\nMajority leader and once they do that then it'll be time for the Senate to to move on with that with that stuff so we'll see how that works out and folks who are looking at this politically may say well what the Democrats are trying to do is\nGet an FBI investigation that will take months and prolonged this thing keep the you know actual um keep Kavanaugh off the bench and he won't be confirmed and then hopefully by then we'll have somebody who beats Donald Trump and we'll have a new president and then they can appoint whoever they want to the\nBench so the FBI is continuing their probe into a cabin on here that they\nDon't count all the majority leader has to be very careful here to to wait and give ample time for the FBI to complete its its report on Brett Kavanaugh so as not to uh you know up in the agreement he has was just like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski\nOr he could get those senators to vote yes flake is already on the board is yes but he doesn't want to disrupt that agreement to by forging ahead too quickly\nYeah 'cause like I said okay you got to do a pro but it has to be done within a week and so if you do that so he's going to continue that\nSo both the United states senatorial candidates are going to be in College Station on the same day oh hey down coming up this Friday as a matter of fact I don't think they'll see each other um\nBut the or maybe they should

are doing well listening to your show thank you\nHey I just wanted to comment on the assault Kavanaugh issue and how we can all get along among um I don't know if you remember a few months ago\nBut bringing that into today I'm thinking with Kavanaugh and the bar fight in rowing ice I'm thinking everybody now can get along and we can just have a boat on abolishing ice we could get rid of ice gray\nWe could get rid of cold drinks\nOr they could be wonder Bruce there's a lot of thought put put into this bit isn't there there's a lot of thought\n'cause the left wants to abolish why you're saying every in fact I got to let him go but carry that was you put a lot of thought into town abolishing I get it balancing I ain't got it yeah\nGet it God asking you about the way bringing it's an eye Kansas city's not playing around with Kimber devices rays mhm get rid of ice cream nobody's going to pay for that or they get rid of ice cream now oh heck no iced tea\nCan't do that can you think so there's a lot of talk about abolishing nice and and Bruce is way ahead of the game here\nIt is a eight eight nine four one ... eighty eight nine four one Seventy two four seven\nAbout an hour away from in culture she's got a new column out where she talks about how white men are under attack on that to the Judiciary Committee in the capital hearings and she's absolutely right about that or we will talk about it but after this break right here going to be a Donald Trump junior the son\nOf the president of the United states we're to talk about everything under the sun and it really like I tell you it was a motivating conversation because those are people who are thinking about not taking part\nIn the mid term election I'm here to tell you you're going to get you going\nBelieve it I see the numbers it got to get out you got to stay on we can't just be fat happy and lazy and expect that stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz he needs guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself he imagined giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nBut there there's everything is there a question I think about it I mean that would be a disaster for this\nCountry but then we got to turn around and we've got to bring our friend it's trending on drugs today to you blow so you're saying I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and do we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time and one\nWas common sense and experience\nSo your dad had the magic wand the whole time and one\nWas common sense and experience right you know it's not magic one it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone actually affects you wait real change when it comes to economic our fiscal policy on fiscal but I think about it we we discuss the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end you look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts fine you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama did when they cross it they slap you in the face will they they tried doing that we should put fifty seven Tomahawk missiles and ... and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA it can't\nBe renegotiated can be done and congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done ... when when when you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known him and he says is all the time to ... it didn't go on one person steps up and says\nFormer President Obama just told me one thing you did that caused this to happen because how you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama dude and six to ... how could Obama even for a second even think to themselves yeah I did that because we're\nNot we're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media work like I said oh no this is the new normal one point eight percent within that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that right because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on it's acted in Bend Oregon putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of the ticket\nI mean that's not really knowing where you know his his money's coming from all places other than saying\nThis because you know those are in Texas the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice on the board I mean I've only saved nine hundred kids last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work in your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again\nBecause we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I mean they change and we have to remember that because they can\nAll go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the excess let's talk about Texas as you know based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because there's been over ... challenge Robert Francis or because what I call when these somehow cold really appropriating but he's Hispanic and he's not he's\nNot at all that spending on he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic selling for granted something like that they would destroy absolutely you you you were going to get out of every day for ... or it's not a problem\nWhen he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that for it it would be you know he shouldn't be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ... we're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing you know it's been great for Texas He's done he's fought for those values\nI look at the ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator and Texas\nWell he's getting big support for Mellon so you know that's good ... ... it's Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known for wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises and he's always done exactly what he said he would do\nWould you use your dad until I went out in the primaries but they're very very similar politically in that they're not doing it politically\nThey say I'm going to do this this this this and this\nAnd you're dead and Ted actually believe I should do those things I promise beat it was just given us you know a rainbows and puppy dogs it's weird well\nOf course I listen I I really respect had him and it was it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was a big ... a a dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff\nI I went uh and all my friends are from tax on there all the time hunting fishing or raise a lot of money there and campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and have it at a couple of friends tests at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner we say hey ... you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel\nRight in the middle of this the on Pennsylvania Avenue or they'll have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along it came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours knows that took guts yeah but you know when I showed me\nBeyond the guts if he understood Donald Trump's going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good protects and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies and that was impressive to me that was a great a testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told a story before but I think it's actually relevant because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean again look at where\nBagel rocks money is probably coming from writing that probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that probably represents the average guy in a Hollywood studio somewhere else you know that's the difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nAt Texas I mean just look at the economic success with it had to look at all the stats but you want to become California give me a ...\nAnd the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior\n... you have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut I'm going to I'm going to lower your paycheck we're going to open the border we're going to get rid of arguments enforcing the border in every single week to read or catching them is Thirteen or stopping\nSex trafficking why would anybody want new blows you to be in charge against things are going so great right now why you have no idea but like I\nSaid we're we're not in a fair fight you know the media will show business low right thing to do I'm all for taking care of other people once we take care of our own problems you know we've got plenty of friends we got a disastrous education system would what twenty eight and like the world after\nA long list of third world countries that you and half of you know to spend that I have spent the a small fraction of what we spend per capita right I mean we had we had that problem that we're working on fixing and they're making great progress with all of those things but like we need to keep going and you're going to have people in there that basically the next two years until twenty twenty you will be a total\nStalemate nothing will get done it'll be a total disaster I Want to keep this winning going for another six years so we need people in the house my father can't do it by himself you know he needs to get a pet and these guys like so many of the Congress men that are up to help him get these things done and to prevent these asinine policies\nBut we can't be complacent we can't sit back and say no no I Love what's going on this is great we got to get in there and fight because the other side is doing it and they don't fight fair as we've witnessed over the last two weeks\nNow I Would be remiss if I didn't very quickly ask you about Kavanaugh you see these these are these allegations when people were making ... there's going to be completely ... speeches allegations there are holes through all of it this way and it's just a zone from your your buddy you have an out of you know I should add sarcastically obviously um who completely changes your story that she told NBC the day before\nShe was willing to pay a penalty because she was a liberal and she's attacking Trump ... you know in in his things\nThey're going to be light is he going to be on the court\nI live in ... if if we fold on this one with ... you know\nI live in ... if if we fall on this one with you again on to found out the original I Can't remember the ... right right I Can't remember who Harry hero that brought our home right take care of them bowl where it was I mean God\nGive me a break now on the political ... it was so important\nIt was so important that Senator Feinstein stat and the allegations for two months before bringing it up if that doesn't read the political hit ya that's the other day I Would kill to work and I mean this is a scary scary precedent that you could ruin a guy\nAnd his life and not just any guy a guy that's been through six FBI investigation right a guy that's been a public figure a guy that's been nominated to court after court after court you know and then all of a sudden now if the Supreme Court now we're coming up with it yeah and then third accuser come that I saw you know at first I was raped and it was getting ready to and it was cereal game right\nUh you know then it was well he's an alcoholic and he was a violent alcoholic he threw a beer once and it turns out he threw an ice cube\nLike give me a break attacks continue they keep going the other side fight it's not it's a\nScary to me as a parent you know that and it should be to anyone who's listening if you're a parent that someone could just to try to destroy in this case son's life with no fat no cooperation\nNo memory no anything but we are to take that as gospel that's not how our system works you know it's not it only works that way if you're a liberal Democrat\nAnd and it works in their favor and the media carries their water and they keep going and it's a scary precedent because it means that no one is safe if this guy up and say no one is say\nHe's the president of the United states sun it's Donald Trump junior dumping the million man I really appreciate it it's my pleasure talking back after this one that Jo packed shows the writer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "College Station", "day": "02"}
