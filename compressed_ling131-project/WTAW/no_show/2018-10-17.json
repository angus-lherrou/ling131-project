I just took a picture of ministers seriously now you know the kid will do I'm I'm feeling a now\nHated eight nine four one package Joe ... outcome when he goes align one region of your patients injury what's going on\nI don't care for taking my call her woken hundred and type ... thank you I [laughter] my pleasure I wanted to make a comment on a couple of things\nTo think mainly first I just wanted to mention the fact that if if if they were ... were alive today well and I believe the end even something like Obama vaccine charming\nHave a silver con and he would he he'd be able to lie very convincing me that's like a prank of life\nUm okay wasn't looked like somebody that was rough so that that was my first thought that that and\nI just wanted to really quickly and contractor reaction to rather than so called um you know drunken super races cat yeah and and the outrage she faced very is President Obama's response to Trayvon Martin trial\nAnd I honestly feel like his aunt and his support for the wrong side he had blood on his hands ... it was it encouraged and propped up\nA riot and I would even in death black lives matter and\nAnd yet here he is Harold data hero and you know Roseanne Barr we never see a loud mouth yeah team you know and one key thing that the national anthem I mean she didn't lose their job and that was for me incredibly ...\nWas I mean those are like oh she's having it horribly was getting booted and then graduate ... yeah so this is rose in it is but you're right you say one thing about Valerie Jarrett who has a connection to Obama in this day and age are in big trouble\nYeah exactly I I just feel like it's such it's such hypocrisy you know the code moral outrage at at a at a comedian famed something and cry that the attacks versus\nPresident Obama's broadcast word or that we're you know extremely device as\nI Do want to do in the correct a couple of ... it wasn't attached it wasn't in private it was a tweet that she did publicly either ... you're right um but but I Do want to agree with you on Obama not only with Trayvon Martin but also with Michael Brown\nAnd also was was a skip what's his face the the the guy from Cambridge when there was going on and on right when there was an issue I'm In this country between police officers\nAnd or or somebody like this guy's a room and who was not a police officer with his community watch guy if the person appeared to be white German was when he was just panic but if you told them a lot of white Hispanic\nIf the person was white and the other person was black Obama knee jerk react to every single time supported the black side\nEven though Trayvon Martin went back and forth a guy that's why I ended up dead even though of Michael Brown walked into the convenience store and beat up the owner and and stole something and was high on drugs and attacked a police officer and his cruiser that didn't matter they they took the side of of Michael Brown in fact they rebuilt people from the White House to his funeral\nAnd what a shame to skip which is just Skip Gates in Cambridge the guy was breaking into his own house and the police officers stopped and said hey just proved to be that this is your house\nAnd for some reason accomplish racist according to Obama and according to Skip Gates so you're right every single time you have the opportunity Obama always took the side of the black person or the minority over the majority or the white person or the white establishment that's what people would call the police because even if you're black and you're a cop\nBlack lives matter would say you're not black you're blue\nAnd they put you to different classifications so she's right about that I I'm not going to agree that seat and would look like President Obama although I Do agree that that she is not going to show up and have horns in flames coming out of his face\nOr it will be it will be somebody that we wouldn't otherwise nobody ever called him Satan that doesn't make sense to me I Do appreciate the injury I appreciate your very very much um here's the challenge of got Jeff in Rhode Island of java got no time at all and and um I've got to give it to you but I've got like forty five seconds before the break and you make it up and\nI can do a thing I'll tell you this right up that a number one a truck\nWas the guy that nobody expected to win right hand or are we all expected to lose but he came through and it was the businessman that nobody expected because he was not a politician who is a businessman to\nI Want to make a little shout out to my uh my my a veteran friends\nI'm a veteran a Cold War veteran of the twenty six Yankee Infantry Division one twenty six signal battalion no yeah number three quickly\nA core very quickly uh um the other thing I wanted to say was that uh uh the term Pocahontas is incorrect it's oh God if you caught this term by a local New England guy call we car\nNice we we love it we love how we how he's a great guy yeah of folk on his focus either way we will talk\nAbout that with Jeff deal he's up now she's a Republican taking on Elizabeth Warren for her Senate seat right here next to the Joe ... show don't touch with us here listening to jail [noise]\nOr that basically said that she was a ... a directory this for lawyers that colleges that want to hire and look at you know when she got the University of Pennsylvania she insisted should be a listed\nAs Native American but when she got to Harvard and got that job she gave us their self from that national directory as Native American so clearly when she was done using that it was a it out and porn do anymore and she never went to any Native American\nEvents on campus or the fact is she never apologized for that the issue is been bothering people for a long time but he's the one who ended up yesterday opening Pandora's box and talking about it\nWell I'm with you this was going to go away I mean the president called her Pocahontas makes you look like ... she's a victim she complained about card the fact that she did a DNA test and put the results out there that proves that you and I are more Native American and she is and I'm not at all\nThat just doesn't make any ... she actually do she looked through your softball and if you're the president of softball or do you think that she ... going in because she's not stupid [laughter] do you think that she thought going into this is gonna be the the victory for whoever Trump impossibly that get thrown the national stage to be the denominator twenty twenty\nWhat is it a couple of things going I think she knew she had to try to put the issue aside some how she's going to run she meant union twenty twenty and and during the Kavanaugh hearings she was so desperate to make the national scene that she doctored video and did a fundraising letter off of that she also did another fundraising letter off the uncorroborated or testimony of Dr for\nAll of this basically to try to make her name out the national headlines at a time when she's competing with Kamala Harris and of course a center of Spartacus yeah I mean that's what the goal is for her to try to beat the far left progressive nominees for\nA two thousand and twenty and again in Massachusetts I first of all she has missed leading us for a long time you know she was on meet the press saying that she has no intention of running for president Joan yet said that many times and then all of a sudden she says I'm going to take a hard look at it we found out with the Washington Post story\nJust this last weekend that basically she's been spending a lot of money half a million dollars on candidates around the country waiting over seven million dollars for candidates\nI she's of course then to Ohio recently as stumped for their candidate for governor in Pennsylvania in Oklahoma a few weekends ago while I was up in Lawrence dealing with people with the gas line explosions here in our state\nSo she's been spending a considerable amount of time or basically working on that presidential run and now I think people in Massachusetts or fully aware she has no intention of working for them\nShow or spend the next two years if she's reelected\nTraveling around the country a delivery nothing for us\nWhich is actually also admitted that she she would not commit to uh to to living on her term if she wins or doing she says I Can't promise that all state senator for the next six years which is something that you will promise right\nExactly you know I mean Massachusetts has some issues whether it's health care the fishing industry the opioid crisis and things I've been working on things I Know I can continue to work on\nA where she's been MIA and I think I'm right now it's really interesting as a move afoot in this state to try to get Deval Patrick ... he's the former governor of Massachusetts\nHas become a candidate for a running in twenty twenty so it's interesting even the Democrats in Massachusetts seem to be trying to crowd her out of this field because I think it's clear at this point she really can't avoid stepping in it any time she's on the national stage\nWhether it's calling law enforcement and criminal justice system racist whether in saying that anybody who voted for Trump as part of a stew of racist I mean she really just had that same negative tone that Hillary Clinton had as well\nYeah I agree totally it's Jeff deal he's a Republican running against a Elizabeth Warren for Senate you know in Massachusetts but you run a ... and that's it's a pretty good place to go because the Republicans were looking like it might be bad November\nAh the the big wave whatever that is basically been retired Goldman when you're ... but anyway\nA blue wave allegedly was gonna um given my house back the Senate was going to be very close might even given the Senate now it looks like they might dean three or four seats including you um because it would just comment on even those who were center center center left to live in Massachusetts do not like with the left just dude\nYou're not hearing are you finding meant to be the case are you feeling this the impact of Kavanaugh on on your ... to see you know\nYeah there's a lot of people in Massachusetts or that feel that he was railroaded I'm the father of two daughters so of course I'd want them to be listening to if something happened but the fact is there was no corroborated evidence with a a basically an eleventh hour near a tent or Dianne Feinstein her the senator the ranking member of the judiciary could have\nHad that uh those allegations investigated in private six weeks earlier she didn't she chose to drop it like a bombshell too embarrassed if a man and she ended up ruining two lives um the accuser any accused\nAnd in the process made the Senate look increasingly bad and I think that people are so sick and tired of Washington looking dysfunctional and they know that Warren is basically the tip of that dysfunctional spear um again because she takes such awful actions about going out there and basically saying presumption of innocence the cornerstone of our democracy that means nothing if you want to just\nMake sure that Republicans don't get their nominee for the Supreme Court or that partisanship doesn't work even in Massachusetts and I I'll say this Joe\nYou know we are the state where Ted Kennedy used to hold the same seat and even though he was the liberal lion of the Senate it would work with Republican presidents and Republican governors yeah to deliver for our state people are sick and tired of war and not delivering and then becoming a national embarrassment as well\nI Wonder is Massachusetts is ready for somebody who's not found overwhelming regulation overwhelming grace of of government overwhelming taxation because to me when I figured it was one other than the Pocahontas stuff the thing that comes to mind is she's basically your social she's basically\nOther than the Pocahontas stuff the thing that comes to mind is she's basically your socialist she's basically far leftist that says if we control everything we're the smart people they knew people will have a better life I don't\nWant her to control me is that really what it is it's sort of be the guy who believes in independence liberty and freedom against the person to believe that she's the smartest person in the room\n[laughter] well look I'm an Eagle Scout I always thought you'd have to get a better than you found it I ran for office at the age of forty and now that the running for the Senate never thought I'd be doing this but it's something I think is calling it's not supposed to be a career you and I'll tell you with Elizabeth Warren wanted war and wanting to nationalize they've been having government determine what your board of directors\nComposition should be you know that's one step towards Venezuela and look at what's going on right there she wants health care to be run\nBy government and if you know if you like having a you know dialysis six months after you needed\nA like England has sure go to that socialist healthcare where he like having hip replacements after five years go to Canada but if you like having the United states where we actually get procedures done in a timely manner you know we shouldn't have government running our health care\nAnd so you know one cannot have government run our lives enough in fact she wants to access to the point where I think on CNBC she said fifty percent would be the starting point up too and we don't know that feeling I guess the the host that Ninety percent might be too much and she agreed that somewhere between fifty percent Ninety percent uninsured or take a your income Joe\nIt just doesn't make any sense artist Jeff deal he's a Republican\nRunning for US Senate against Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts I Wish you the best of the you've got to a debate coming up friday night

deputy press secretary Russia on with this Russia or you\nHave Joe I'm doing great um and a kind of looking forward to um you know that\nThe coming weeks ahead and and happy to talk about God the news or the day\nYeah man listen we it's always a pleasure to have you and have the access they were taking the time we're getting closer the midterms are right around the corner and it's certainly boost blue wave that I I called the ... just the tone sounds are both the toilet flushing when they were blue wave but dug a blue wave isn't really waving as much and people are talking about the red dawn\nA rush but we still have enough momentum and traction from the capital hearings where people really saw the the exposing of the left and how negative in a horrible now hateful they are are we going to be able to carry gotten to the midterms are no\n[noise] well uh let me be careful about how much politics I talk about um as a government official but I Will\nSay that um people I'm a on a supporters of the president I think are energized after the last few weeks it's not just the confirmation of a judge now justice Kavanaugh has to do with um you know to strengthen the economy\nHas to do with a new free trade agreement\nA man has to do with um that the ... century staying on healthcare on issue after issue the president is winning and I think at at the core level or his supporters all around the country are enthused by that\nAnd I agree with you and it's not just Kavanaugh it's actually people starting to understand that the left doesn't seem to be running on anything I'm ... and that's really an issue I mean when you're talking about tax cuts to you and I talked about so often\nUm and we talk about you know employers getting more money to give to employees or to hire more people we talk about an economy that she's our trade imbalance being balanced out\nI don't know what the left really brings to the table do you\nUm you know I I don't I mean that's why there are attacks have grown frankly more shrill and um you know and and in some cases turned violent um you know one of the things that the left has been talking about of late is health care and I think that's an issue where if\nAnd talking about of late is health care\nAnd I think that's an issue where if you actually look at the facts and look at the record\nYou see this president actually delivering a Democrats and that's this began with a President Obama\nPromised that people can keep their plans that their premiums would go down right and that seniors can keep the care that they've known for years none of those things turned out to be true Renee in fact lied to the country and in fact you're seeing this president come in and with his a regulation cuts of actually\nUm for the first time since the law was put into effect actually cut premiums are under Obamacare is now I'm you know\nCutting these regulations as a lot of people in the individual insurance and group insurance markets to actually pay lower premiums for the first time he takes President Trump to deliver on Brock Obama's promises\nThat somebody is raw show he's a deputy press secretary for the White House um when we talk about about medical we know that we say the president's served um those making fifty thousand dollars or less\nIf you were eighty percent of those who are paying the taxes were the fines when when they couldn't afford health insurance that went away with the individual may be going away to people a ton of money but now the left to their story is Medicare for all Raj will be to help you understand how we're coming up with somebody to ... trillion dollars to pay for Medicare for all\nWell Joe your guess is as good as mine but it sounds like it's going to come here from your uh your listeners pocket ... look um that the Democrats and this starts from Bernie Sanders on down but every\nEvery idea that he had only a few years ago seems to be mainstream now and the Democratic party is eight thirty two trillion dollar proposal\nTo take away private insurance essentially make it not essentially what am I saying it is actually to make it illegal to have a private health insurance plan and have government bureaucrats who run the post office uh and and many of the other failing agencies\nAre around around the country had them essentially set up a national health service I'm reading it's dangerous for healthcare it's dangerous for um\nYou know for private health insurance and for seniors in particular particular it's it's dangerous and if you actually look\nAt the model that has been created a lot of people a point to Medicare Medicare funds private insurance it's the department of Veterans Affairs it's the VA would really love our veterans but the VA has seen wait times they've seen\nPoor standards of care and many instances it's seen you know what you what you will have that the government takes over everybody's health insurance\nAnd that's exactly right I mean we're seeing that with the ... we're seeing that with some researchers have Medicaid Medicare receiving doctors back out because they're not getting reimbursed as much as as the\n... the actual item that they're doing for a person would cost them and that's all because of Obamacare the last thing we want to do is over regulate it even more ... and tell everybody um we're gonna take over your your medical period but at the same time\nThey're winning years I think forty percent of millennials think that socialism is good because the older hearing is free stuff\n... how do we convince them if they're really using free stuff available there's going to call somebody simply\n[noise] well I think it's going to be a debate of ideas I think we're going to have a this clash of ideas and the coming weeks and and frankly coming years um look the way of socialism has not worked uh in any part of the world it didn't work in communist Russia it's not working in in certain parts of Europe\nOr their entire a civil or an entire country and being bankrupt\nThrough bad ideas and um\nThis is a country that through this president's policies have seen the lowest unemployment rate nearly fifty years so yeah if it freaks out free stuff sounds good to everyone I mean it's it's a it's an interesting idea but we actually uh go to Brett brass tacks and figure out who has to pay for these things\nAnd what is it actually cost I think mine's will shift\nIs wrong show a deputy press secretary ... having the excess loving you alive right now the president really is\nBeing um he's being checked in terms of the people are so well just trumped up you know twenty twenty would quite frankly for house goes to the to the left or if the Senate goes to the left\nGod Forbid them to president acumen cheat what he promised he would achieve and all of Americans who pay taxes are paying lower taxes where she more money in her paychecks we've got more expendable cash we're seeing consumer confidence through the roof we're finally balancing out these trade deals all that kind of stops if he loses the house or Senate no\nWell I'm certainly puts a damper on a similar efforts but ah you know I Do think first of all the president has accomplished quite a deal and a second of all the um\nYou know the president's ability to do things or have to I mean I'll have to work with a potentially a democratic a chamber of Congress but let's not worry about that right now we're focused on the president's agenda moving forward and\nMoving things along as much as we can we still have confirmations and the judicial side we still have a number of policy priorities are trying to work on and um you\nKnow if if uh you know this doesn't go to a certain way and next month than the president still has tremendous a constitutional uh authority right they didn't quite a lot around the world and to defend his um achievements here so far\nRaj Shah got less than thirty seconds how many questions have yet to hear about horse race and Pocahontas today\n[noise] I I think I Would probably more equipped to answer questions about Pocahontas or faith I'm never a word I thought I'd say I have a radio show I I\nI Will say I I Will say this though I'm as somebody just to who followed um her political career in Massachusetts in two thousand twelve\nI'm Senator Warren ... kind of revelation with the DNA test and that whole thing is just it's it's really it's really a despicable thing because I think we've already lost is you know her I her identity or this or that that that people are talking about it that she claimed a heritage\nTo get ahead or in life\nFor ... and I ended up professor and I have to yeah I have to leave it right there er Raj we love you bet you so much

we can go out to eat once a week and we want revenge or looking really good why don't have to worry about voting and I really do think people but we're starting to be loathed asleep by that but Kavanaugh will come back up\n... you know he really did and um I think an American population because yeah you're right things are great my money my bank account can pay my mortgage you know my kid graduating college not moving back into my basement right got a job right now um\nAnd you can think of roses a fine place but they don't realize the distinct political differences in the two parties and what's happened um with Kevin ... is reignited the importance of voting but I think President Trump has been great on the campaign trip but it was so if you're a voter and you hate\nPresident Trump than it might have been or you know a Republican lean voter you're not going to vote for Republican senator Donald Trump showing up isn't going to change you know Donald Trump\nI mean to the state is going to be in Missouri and in Arizona and Nevada that\nRallies the base of a group of people that you have to turn out to support Dean Heller and in a Republican candidates in and out of these other states they show up and we actually win regain these in the Senate and do you ... ... I I Believe in a two party system I Do too we don't have one already ruled a Democrat\nAnd how the Democrat Party is a good thing but not a socialist Democrat Party and if we if conservatives want to kill socialism and bring them back to him on a center left Democratic Party the wages that'd be a new beat him in November right and make 'em recap\nWeight and we think their politics get rid of Bernie Sanders Alexandria Ocasio Cortez I'm ... ...\n... ... lives with Warren Cory Booker Kamala Harris I mean we can talk to double line they'd gone so far left and the ... gone so far nobody\nThat I think you're right if they don't recalibrate the Democrats are done for a long time I I don't think they're smart enough to realize that what you just said though it is shown W different several Republican the great state of Wisconsin we've had some major disasters recently and other you've been working harder legislation\nFor flood insurance ... what what is lacking right now and and what is it that you're trying to get done\nThey for asking because this is a a big government a program a lot of poor people live in a plane you know needed flood insurance we want to help them out but a lot of rich people live on the coast as well I don't want to do is listen that\nInsurance companies to come into the marketplace and all her private policy instead of the national flood insurance policy right\nSo we are all risk from the taxpayer and put her on the private sector number one and then if you're going to build in a flood plain less as a taxpayer stopped subsidizing it's real simple um if you want to there that's great um I don't think\nYou should not we're not going to subsidize the split insurance if that's where you choose to bill now if you're in New Orleans and you've been there for two hundred and fifty years and you're poor you know what we're going to help you out but if he's other\nProblems that we have in the program that we're we're dumping Dover dumping billions of dollars um into a program that just is that it's right for reform and we aren't Republican and Democrat opposition are people who come to Washington job and say I'm all oppose the subsidies I have something you know hey government subsidies however\nThis up seeing it helps my people I'm okay with that\nAt some point we've got to reform all these programs is you can't\nReform flood insurance program for how the\nHeck are we going to reform Social Security and Medicare and all of the other food stamps all of the programs that are bankrupt in this country if you can't get this small common sense reform done for them ... and you see how important is with the hurricanes that are just hit Florida in the east coast\nOf the country we want to make sure people can get coverage but I don't why you needed to be on the hook all the time we have we have kept private capital that will come in here and take some of this risk and take us off the hook thing I've ever or bill I'm fighting to get it through the Congress and I've got some bipartisan opposition\nFrom conservatives who I had scratcher for\nMore than a lot of lobbyists out there to what it comes to insurance so that's probably why it Sean Duffy district several Republican the great state of Wisconsin let me go back to the economy more specifically trade\nThe president dared to Canada you can't you know mark up our dairy products by three hundred percent he ... to to tell Mexico you can't have a profit against those to the tune of tens of billions of dollars every year in ... you were not going to keep on giving your handouts as we get screwed on this and\nThe left wing nuts how dare you these are our friends who do you think you are\n... and Sean down the line at work to be you stepped up they're buying stuff now we've got a new what what is that the u._s.

worried about an increase in a mysterious and rare condition [noise] mostly affects children can paralyzed arms and legs\nWith one or twenty seven confirmed suspected cases this is a according to the CDC\nThose sixty two cases have acute flashing my light is very FM uh\nThey've been they've been confirmed and twenty two states according to Nancy ... who is a top official at the Centers for Disease Control and prevention more than Ninety percent of the confirmed cases have been in children\nEighteen and under what the average age being four years old there's no specific treatment for the polio like disorder and long term outcomes are unknown\nThe ribbon serious disorder affects a person is nervous system specifically spinal cord neurological conditions like you'd have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins in genetic disorders they're saying there's a lot that they do not know about them\nAnd the frustration is is that with all the efforts going into studying it they haven't been able to identify it nor can they find a cure for it nor I mean here's the thing they can't find the CDC can't find are unable to find because for the majority of\nSome of these new diseases that are rising up from out of nowhere and that despite all the efforts I mean we know this is a terrifying idea for parents but the problem I'm seeing the problem it\nWas it was odd because I was looking into as I said a weeks ago the idea of what is called the evolution of viruses the evolution\nOf the way we treat them\nAnd how he just seems to me\nThat while there are some patients that you you know with this condition they recover quickly there are others who have paralysis or require ongoing care\nSo it just depends on I guess the luck of the draw I mean they were tracking this all the way back to twenty fourteen when there were a hundred and twenty confirmed cases in twenty sixteen there were a hundred and forty nine confirmed cases\nAnd then the officials are saying now that for twenty eight team they believe that it's going to surpass the previous years\nSo\nKeep in mind this ... this is a rare condition it's affecting less than one in you know one in a million people\nOkay so I mean it's\nAs a parent myself I worry for much my child or I worry for my step son it's dramatic disease and health\nOfficials want to raise awareness about the symptoms to ensure parents seek medical care immediately of their children's ... sudden onset of weakness in their arms and legs\nA\nBit of saying that polio is not the cause of it because the CDC has tested every single stool specimens from patients and none of tested positive for polio\n\nUm West Nile virus is not causing this way of a rule that ruled out west Nile\nUm but there is some virus\nThat starts out as the respiratory illness so we have this respiratory illnesses sets in so it's like having the flu and then suddenly you start noticing that your children cannot control their arms of the legs\n\nAnd so they don't have a pathogen identified yet it's consistently being detected inpatient spinal fluid with regard to FM\n\nSo it all goes back to the same old same old idea of washing the hands staying up to a you know it was basically wash their hands using insect repellent is this is the thing that's interesting they were saying you must you'd order to prevent this we we suggest that you use mosquito repellent\nSo what does that tell you [laughter] what what does that tell you it tells you that this is this is probably being spread by mosquitoes the very thing that we said we'd be responsible for a biological attack on the country or one of the very few things will be used for again a function exercise would be mosquitoes\nA Bill Gates released mosquitoes one time in a in a meeting that he had a Ted Talk to demonstrate how mosquitoes are more dangerous than sharks\n\nAnd so once again it's the idea that\nYou know we're we're in the middle of an evolving it's evolving\nPassage into the balding diseases balding or evolving drugs and and having to having to prevent things but we have to have well I called prophylactic\n... protection [noise] would you mean

twenty three Indian ancestry to sell to places like GlaxoSmithKline Pfizer so they can use DNA to basically zero in on certain DNA types of diseases\nAnd treatments they have to do this because the evolutionary process of pain and suffering is hey Bob the out of their hand and the and the CDC and all these other groups that can't keep up you can't keep up and get something is making his own

I I was competing products for people that burns or trauma surgery or post surgery or it was a wrinkles are hyper in a dark spot in ancient and what I ended up doing\nIs I took my formulations that I felt in the army for patients were staff and I turned it dies formulations into over the counter products and start a business and and that's basically what I Do now I ... I haven't seen here but then I had another one that I saw\nI create anti aging and beauty products\nYou know you have a unique way of of of talking about what big pharmaceuticals argue said that when you were you actually did a time as they are ... and send them pharmacist\nLike how for like instead count\nPoorly can stick pharmacist you've spent some time there and you said you felt bad because what you were dealing with poison it that's where we are you said it's poison\nAnd see that's the thing is that it doesn't matter I mean we we have such horrible or would we say we you know we have such horrible ways of of talking about certain I guess it's a degree of penalty with drugs if you take\nA if you take a pain pill that's okay if you if you take heroin your bad or if you smoke marijuana and your bad but they're all they're all bear for a reason right\nHappen a quiet that some drugs became good in other drugs he came back I mean well how did that I Know exactly for example marijuana how many people in jail now because of marijuana but now or or just because they were selling marijuana five ... years ago but today it's OK\nToday in Colorado you can just you can buy marijuana just walk off the street by marijuana\nSee what you what gets me is that there is also people that are on the educated about what is legal what is it legal now with the use of cannabis of course the cat it was a schedule one and a lot of states federally but ah they have now are pretty much said that uh things like CBD oils and I it brings to ride from hemp are not illegal and they can be used\nAs well how how others prohibition where a quiet\nIt don't work you know\nIt's obvious that doesn't work it never works you want to do trust what isn't it the ... of the government to create a a police state around people desire to ah intoxicated themselves you know animals like when talking himself monkeys love alcohol I Love alcohol ... earth was warning Laurie see\n... and ... and she was a marijuana plants and animals loved to change their reality actually consider stumped by some people some research scientist to me a dry\nWell now now they want to bring back ... be for certain types of uh the depression so\nTo see repeat the FDA and mushrooms for people who are dying of cancer\nRight yeah I I don't understand like I said ... the propaganda machines in the United states\nAlways seem to find a way to create a some sort of scenario or propaganda feed where they're telling people for the certain drug you're using it's a moral failing to use this drug at the world from you if you're addicted it's moral failing\nAnd this is why we get people turning to harder drugs have nothing to do a gateway drugs have everything to do with well I'm not getting the satisfaction both physically and ... so therefore I'm going to be used by Bobby until I reached that does that mean squared by that time\nYou were the one that told me about oxytocin you're saying that ah that may be that the the the reason behind addiction not dependence but addiction is is pretty much a a lack of oxytocin\nThink other chemicals but I don't think it's a fascinating because oxytocin goes up when we bond with each other\nWhen we socialize with ... with each other when we gaze into each other's I even into a stranger's eyes are oxytocin levels go out and we feel connected to the world and this is based on bio chemistry this [noise]\nAn levels go out and we feel connected to the world and this is based on bio chemistry and its course\nAnd so we want to just learn how to how to leverage our biochemical you know are owned by a chemistry you know why you're dummy levels go up when you clean kitchen\nYou know I think do you ever look at your kitchen when is really nasty and then you finish cleaning it and you're so happy and pride you can't stop looking at your clean kitchen no yeah obscene amount ... why I just\nFigured out how nice Janine is going to be doing for the rest of the day if like leaving the\n[laughter]\nI mean these are things we can do to leverage our own chemistry and clean the garage initial project getting this right in that book we can uh uh uh ... concocted a meal for somebody we can get money to somebody who's a homeless\nA home a beggar on the street when you hear the dollar to somebody on the street your oxytocin\nLevels go up and you fight cancer and your blood pressure drops and your skin heels and your wrinkles start the day all like giving a homeless person that dollar on the street or getting stranger some law\nAnd it's so amazing to me how all the things that we call the virtues are bio chemically ballet there the the the uh the purchase of kindness and generosity and and and love of your fellow man uh there there are there are\nA biochemical outlaw that balance based on this virtues\n[noise] this ah this new drug called Sylvia D. S. U. V. I. A.\nAllegedly five hundred times more powerful than morphine a sentimental and oxycontin or the ... what's that called the movie is this a B. S. U. V. I. A. the Sylvia I think that's what they call it\nUm the pill goes underneath the tongue by an apple cater dissolves right away it's more fast acting than any other opioid national deal yeah it's it's ... is it true that ... you get just a little bit on your fingers you could die from it from an overdose\n[noise] you know ... ... you out of it is probably the most powerful all ain't about him that case you didn't ask version of that now you yeah\nYeah so I mean I can just imagine if that gets on the street or if anybody is people will be dying of that but it says here uh\nLast year the drug's approval was rejected because of its concerns that could end up in the wrong hands but now they're making waves baby the way for the uh approval of the Soviet the drug maker is ...\n... that's who makes the drug or the FDA is not required to follow the committee's recommendations usually does but it seems that they are going to be releasing this this new drug it's called ... it is allegedly five hundred times more powerful\nThan morphine a more dangerous than fencing oxycontin\nSo I mean look at this ... this is why I say\nThe opioid crisis is a farce the opioid crisis is\nIf something is being concocted by the Centers for Disease Control the FDA ... because they want to make one more crime that they want to be able to bust people for and another reason why they're doing is is because I have I have a belief that they're getting ready to pat and some other drug that they're going to be pushing on the people\nAnd maybe this is one of the one we're talking about tonight but see that's the thing you were talking about we are the masters of our biochemistry\nAnd yard that we're the ones who can change things and I wanted to uh in fact I was talking with you over the phone before I went on the air I'm going to tell you this um\nI have been in Miami those I mean I I've been through a lot health wise and I remember you and I met in Salt Lake City\nAnd uh I had lost at that time Seventy five pounds because I was a I was ballooning to nearly five hundred pounds when I got out of the hospital because of water weight gain and because of sedentary lifestyle\nAnd it was scary because uh I was developing blood clots in my lungs and uh I was I was near death in fact a closer to death that I ever want to be\nAnd uh so what had happened is I made it a point to lose weight and I was losing weight but of course I I you know one of the things you do when you lose weight you feel like you're Superman you can do a lot of things so I went hiking went on a hiking trip\nOut into the city and I actually actually fell on the rocks and banged up my knee pretty bad well bang up your knee pretty bad and being overweight is not a fun relationship\n[laughter] so for the longest time I was having knee pain and I was a I was certainly wondering how could take care of it now since I I'm I'm a blood clot risk I cannot take I take Lipitor so I cannot take an anti inflammatory and said it's just completely out of the question\nSo money was bothering really bad I went to the hospital and the nurse said to me there's nothing I can do for you\nBecause he says we cannot give you and then said to take the information out and that's the problem with a nice it is in plain so I did some reading I did some studying and I found out what what kills inflammation taking sugar out of your diet kills inflammation\nThat's awesome our this artist that point\nWell a pain and and that there's a difference or or you want you want no pain and you want to have the pain without having taken any uh opioids because of course I Do have a prescription for those I don't use them as often as a most people do I have in my column and breaking glass pills I haven't been my in my medicine chest just in case\nYou know I Need somebody for breakthrough pain because ever since I had my surgery my back in my knees and bothered me they told me I'd never walk again\nBecause I had no feeling in my upper legs or because of the nerves they suffered and so I got by I managed to get feeling back a and I managed to be walking I Am walking now\nBut I Do still have swollen legs and I do still have that pain from carrying those legs and trying to get them to give the swelling down so I decided to make a commitment to avoid sugar as much as I can\nIn order to bring the swelling down and since I have done this I have and since I've done this I've lost thirty pounds again about some of the three pounds\nSo I'm learning that sugar is probably the the the thing that induces the most pain in the body is having sugar complex starches and sugars\nAre creating pain in my body and I and I'm avoiding sugar now because I don't want the pain\nIn many ways sugar is like a drop\nIn the in the sense of addiction and the sense of it powerful a biochemical effects on the body their taste kidney may sugar in that type of drug in so quitting sugar in a can of quitting a pharmaceutical dry it had that kind of potency on the body especially\nWhen it comes to information the human body is just not Mandel a lotta sure you'll have more than one piece one teaspoon full of sugar in your bloodstream you're considered to be a diabetic\nAnd that's in over a gallon of blood sugar is very very ... and stuff and and that was a very good move have you tried ... by the way\nA yes of course I I well I have an injustice I but I use it uh I I used as a I have used it a forward we meant and uh I've always felt that it kills the pay better than most pain medications in\nFact that's why should try to world al ... and early\nOkay well I Want to know what it does oil or ... or early because it just it doesn't say I don't see any benefit in the oral I I haven't read enough is it ...\nOh my God I got so many that seizure disorders anti blood sugar a fight cancer it's incredible Frank lions oppression helps you sleep it's great for pain it's important for a digestive health anti inflammatory it's\nNominal mind blowing leaned additional I mean over the top are saying is that the farmers he's been studying medicine for thirty plus years it is ...\nOver the top of things that the pharmacist he's been studying medicine for thirty plus years in his mind blowing Lee medicinal and this is why the federal government hold on a on its pharmacological properties that there are drug companies that are working to make three and a lot of it I Know\nThat that they can sell as prescription medication it's stuff that grows right out of the ground it's almost exactly the same as bio chemicals that your body makes you can inject it and get incredible benefits and on top of everything else there's\nA phenomena known it can happen and we just see where your body just doesn't make an African Avon wake because of ... either all materials and ... and other biochemical problems but he's actually be deficient in can add annoyed that could be caught in like insomnia and anxiety and planning to repaint et cetera so I Would highly recommend it highly highly recommend\nWell there's a need to find something you know because I'll tell you for those I I remember I used to always say\nI Can't stand and faith against that I'd be pro but I Can't stand would do to my stomach and when I got that nice day and that was in the hospital they told me they couldn't give me a tour at all I actually cried I'm thinking what am I going to do it in Cape May be sent me an anti inflammatory and CBD buddy [noise]\nWell I guess I'll have to look into it anyway I Would highly recommend it All right

belly now has a facilities dawn and opportunity to visit with Scottish asteroid carry bigger ruse fulltime hammer for Sawyer\nI have a new furry friend with me today his name is Sawyer and he is the new facility dog it's got its houseware launching a program called paws for hope\nThat is basically Sawyer and so what he is he has a training facility dog that we can use in our forensic interviews forensic medical exams we can use them in our counseling sessions and then when the children that we serve have to go to court to testify he can go with them\nHow to those type of program began\nYeah so Scott house has always looking for ways to make the process of child abuse investigation a little bit easier for children and their families and so in one of the you know other child advocacy centers and in Texas they actually had a facility dog and we\nThought wow what a benefit I personally have dogs and I know after a rough day at work\nThey're there for me they bring me comfort there they look at me they they don't care what I've done if I've made a mistake if I've had a great day if I had a bad day they're just happy to see me and so that level of comfort is something we wanted to bring to children as they're being interviewed as they're having to go through a medical exam\nThat's really tough you know children having to sit down tell a stranger something horrible that's happened to them so I can just sit by them on the couch and and just lay there and and really fall asleep most of the time\nAnd so it's something that is very comforting research shows that\nYou know humans look to animals specifically dogs to kind of helping to terminate their secure or not they look for them for ... to look to them for safety and so if a dog is laying there sleeping that helps children no okay that this is a safe place the dog seems comfortable here so I think I'm OK\nWas just seems to be on George tension because we've seen service dogs with veterans and others who have been through traumatic experiences I guess labeled as why hasn't there been Sawyer\nExactly that's a great point bill you know I'm for us soy your he may not be used with every child he may just be with them being grading them with a wagging tail when they walk into our facility and that just kind of helps them you know calm down a little bit and so you know I definitely think abuse children were the next step in that progression\nTalk all about the selection process and and and the training that's gone into this\nSo Scott he's health is very lucky we receive Sawyer from an organization called canine companions for independence they train service dogs facility dogs hearing alert dogs for people with disabilities for any type of facility and we apply to them about a year ago\nCommitted submitted an application that provided on for days information about Scott he's health information information about me because I'm the handler\nAnd and and we went through a pretty extensive process where they reviewed our application looked at our facility looked at what he would be doing to determine if we would be a good fit we had to do a phone interview we went up there for an in person interview there actually they had that the south central region is in Irving\nAnd so they were very very detailed in the process to make sure that you know one he would be used appropriately and that we were a good fit with their organization and so luckily we were\nAnd we went on a waiting list so we were approved in March and went on the waiting list keeping our fingers crossed and in July we got the call that we would be invited to their team training which was held in August\nSo we went up there and spent two weeks in Irving\nSawyer was very well trained already so they had to train us so we didn't do something that he wasn't used to and so he he was raised in a puppy raisers home for Eighteen months so he lived with a person in their home and they exposed him to everything they could loud noises cat's\nWriting in the car I'm going to all different types of environments just so he would be desensitized and so then after that Eighteen months he went back for what\nIt's just so he would be desensitized and so then after that Eighteen months he went back for what um the staff at canine companions called college\nWhere he spent the remaining time I'm with them getting advanced training learning he knows up to forty commands and then um so he went from there stayed in that program and then luckily got placed with us\nVisiting with Cary Baker the director of scrawny sauce child advocacy center talking about their way to staff member facilities dog Scheuer you mentioned your Sawyer San were yes so that's a twenty four seven responsibility\nIt is yeah you know and it's it's one of the best responsibilities of my job is I get to um take him home with me at night and he gets to play with my dogs and then we come back each day um it's kind of what I think most people want to be able to bring their dogs to work and so now I'm lucky one and get to do that\nAnd the process of Scheuer getting acclimated to the physical ... trials as well as to co workers and then obviously through to the Trojan exactly\nYeah we've had him since August but we want it to make sure before we came out and kind of did a big announcement in the community that he was very comfortable in our facility that we all his staff knew really how to interact with him and so you know the hardest thing for my staffing they have to pretend that he's not there\nBecause we want the children that he's working with to be the most attractive thing to him if he comes in and expects our office manager to get him cookies everyday well that defeats the purpose of having him being there for children and so um they they definitely get their fair share of of Sawyer time they get to love on him because not only does he benefit the children but our staff\nAnd then the law enforcement and child protective services partners that we work with\nMan he I mean he come the benefits of having a dog don't aren't just for children it really does affect everyone and so it's it's been wonderful to have him and and get everybody up to speed on how to interact with Sawyer\nIn addition to the uh official contacted wouldn't children what if any story about Rachel you have Scheuer do in other settings with children\nYeah absolutely you know look he says something that's really hard for people to talk about they don't want to think about it\nAnd so luckily Sawyer is a way for them to learn a little bit about what we do that a level that's safe you know you're just talking about a dog um and and so we plan on using him and ... and the community when we go to educational presentations when we're out health fairs um if you want a presentation from us you may get Sawyer now so\nAnything else with almost no if you want more information you can go find out about Sawyer on

I was going to be more which is you just said she was ... yeah ... million\nSo Jason Lewis says the guy there now he's done a remarkable job you should people a bunch of money on taxes are much more and I see no reason why he wouldn't be reelected but I guess it's a close race\nCorporate taxes lowered so we can build new jobs people getting bonuses and raises that they never expected or because of your work and because of the work of president Donald Trump do people understand exactly how good it is ... and here's the second part of it\nIs there a few of your mind Jason that people get fat and happy New Zealand things are going great I'm not going to rock the boat and go vote\nI think up until the Kavanaugh hearings when people saw the debt almost the political depravity of what some of these folks are willing to go right\nThat almost the political depravity of what she does some of these folks are willing to go right I think I might have been true I Do think people on our side\nAre are realizing just how critical this mid term it but you still got to get out and vote\nAnd you're quite right about her accomplishments is not only did in the economy going again at four four and a half percent at six percent increase in ... after tax take on paying right\nIt's about current technical education which I've let on and got a bill passed that includes our language in it it's about work in a criminal justice reform it's about reforming the metropolitan council which here in Minnesota is on a buck\nAnd citizens and the second district know all about that but my opponent doesn't want to take a stand on anything least about Medicare for all socialized medicine least of all sanctuary cities and building a border wall even though she's taking money from Chris in ... right at least of all things he's going to impeach and vote for Nancy Pelosi so what they're going to do Joe I guarantee it\nIt will find more old radio clips they can throw out there because they are standing for nothing they have NO PLAN except to attack and smear\nWell how does things change should she God Forbid wind the race I mean the people who are listening and you know highly rated we are no ... everywhere else in Minnesota people will shut down a closely right now how bad could things get if the left does in fact when the house if you're on seated which I don't think should happen\nWell look if the if the Democrats take over the house and my opponent is elected and vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker which they will have you given that the tens of thousands of dollars Pelosi of now she she was added another below the fundraiser this cycle you know so that will happen you will see the country grind to a halt\nIf you think the cabin on hearings were good for America you'll love the house under Nancy Pelosi and Angie cry that is a fat\nAnd that's what's on the ballot in November it's as simple as that you want chaos you want resistance you aren't riots or do you want results\nAnd and those are all great questions and you're actually you absolutely spot on I've been going to the cabinet bounce\nUm Fort unfortunately it happened for him and his family and unfortunately it happened for for for ... she was used as much as you would use one Spartacus says things like it doesn't really matter at this point if he's innocent or guilty we just have to stop the\nAmericans on both sides including those who were center left said enough I can vote for these people aren't like we just happen did it happen too far away though because you know that'll be four weeks out when we finally get to the election are people going to be motivated\nI Hope they do sometimes it takes a while for the stuff to sink in you know but certainly walk them folks up your right but I think more than anything else the cabin I hearing or a microcosm of of quite frankly these liberal tactics going back for years and years in your survey the migrations twenty sixteen\nWe we'd just people knew Jason Lewis was they listen to me for two decades on the radio like they listen to you and when these attacks almost eight million dollars worth of attacks taking my worked out of context came out they fed\nHim and that's how the Jason we know yeah and I won I Won the race well now David lifted the national media and anybody they can find a national media has become the opposition research arm of the Democratic party you know and now they're trying to regurgitate that because that's the only play book they've got\nThey can't afford to come out and say hey I'm for sanctuary cities and it gets border security I'm for socialized medicine that will end Medicare as we know and kick the author or if they can't they can't um or Nancy Pelosi speaker so we can have a constitutional impeachment crisis and I'm for packing the Supreme Court right they can't say that so they attack\nAnd take worked out to contact them and it got anything they can find and that up bankrupt radiology\nIt is a Congressman Jason Lewis district district to Republican re state of Minnesota I Hope you vote for him on on election day coming up in the midterms here on November ...\nUm ... you're right and ... it's actually the same story that we see here in Texas where I Am which is kind of Robert freezer work he's holding show Beto he's acting like he's Hispanic use force generation Irish nothing wrong with being an Irish but but I mean why why pretend you're something else but he hasn't said anything and what he's got a lot of identity politics\nExactly you know well it's about identity politics I'm Hispanic Robert Kennedy which makes no sense he's not as ... I also in bringing flowers in rainbows and squirrels\nAnd he's not saying anything other than hoping changing let's work together well or impeachment while he's for abolishing ice while he's against a border wall I mean we do down at least for raising your taxes is that exactly who you're dealing with an easy Craig ... edition ice fishing not seeing any of those things\nAnd that's precisely how do you take money from Kirsten Gillibrand is leading the charge for abolishing eyes yeah and then saying well I I really haven't taken a position on that how do you say I Want to work towards a single payer system and then saying well but I wouldn't vote for the current plant\n... if it's just that you watch the law they don't\nThey don't have to take a position that's unpopular right and so they just attack and by the way all the while raising record amounts of money the likes of which no political cyclists ever seen right wow they run with Citizens United\nPlastered all over their their their bumper stickers how you run out of getting money out of politics and set record after record and fundraising from special interest\nHave you guys debated at all\nYeah we've already got one in the can it'll be airing next week and the other one or two more um but\nAre you going to get her to take a position or not they're going to say she were\nI think I think the one we've already take Joe I think people will uh will see that she doesn't want to take a position\n... ... and that's what people need to see we need to make sure that we expose the lip look it's usually taking positions that you really believes in these things and people Minnesota want to vote for that which would be ridiculous you know that's fair it's not fair to lie about it get into office in become Nancy Pelosi on steroids that doesn't make sense\nWhen she first decided to run Jon Klein within the seat before he retired and she said one of the reasons he wanted to run because Klein opposed the Obama amnesty plant\nAnd that was just untenable\nFor that now she's only been out of core\nRight and so it's just it it is you know I'm just going to ride the blue wave and not take a position that I'll vote for Nancy Pelosi our polish ice sanctuary cities are socialized medicine once I get there but you're not going to know that sort of like you know Obamacare will know what when we read it\nIt is our Jason Lewis I use a representative district to Republican the great state of Minnesota before I let you go I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the ... and why is this guy even sound like ticket afterward Kavanaugh was used accused of and there was no corroboration there was no proven fact I walked away saying it didn't happen\nAnd now we seek he's almost in whose girlfriend one one former girlfriend who one would imagine agreed with him politically is out there showing pictures of her having been pummeled and it's only happened a couple of years ago how was this guy in the running in might possibly become the top law enforcement officer in the state of Minnesota helped me under\n... why have my opponent not told him to resign as you're talking about it all bubbly on him and of course not of course that she didn't take a position on Al Franken that's ridiculous and call her interest on took his money then had to give it back you know took money from\nGarrison Keillor who had to resign over ... charges campaign with a state senator Doug show on who had to resign over sexual harassment shark campaigns are Keith Ellison\nActions speak louder than words Joe and if they if if the Democrats are and I want to talk about sexual harassment and the serious nature of it you look at the actions versus work and it's really astounding\nI was a big fan when you were on the radio I'm certainly a big fan of you know in Congress and I want you to stay in Congress it's Congressman Jason Lewis district to Republicans agree state of Minnesota vote for him on the on November six in the mid term Jason was talking to\nAlways a pleasure Joe thank you sir\nBack after this and the Joe Petro stand writer\n[noise] yeah [noise]\n\nThere's something we probably all can agree on pain is no
