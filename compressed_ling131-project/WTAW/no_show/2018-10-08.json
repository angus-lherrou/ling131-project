comes out they put their testimony stalled married him had of course that never had any like Kevin or any day\nKnow under celebrated versus New York times in Nineteen sixty four year Supreme Court decision\nIt said that if you're a public figure like Brett Kavanaugh basically people can lie about those characters as long as the person speaking does not have actual malice which means they know what they're saying is false when they say Julie sweating they\nCommitted a defamatory slander against Brett Kavanaugh when she said he was involved in group rates and drugging I mean that was\nThat was allied Deborah Ramirez who said that he shook his private parts in my face\nAnd after a week of working with my attorney I kinda figured out who did it thirty four years later that was a lie and then also professor Ford pristine forward every factual statement she made and it's proven to be false now for him to sue he would have to be in a\nFederal court for like the next five to ten years was Michael have an audience snakes like that so I don't think uh\nWas Michael ... snakes like that so I don't think a Supreme Court justice is going to personally to anybody in federal court because it would take five to ten years there'd be repeated depositions\nIn fact the process would be such a gauntlet I don't see bread going through it even though he would have probably win because when you when what are you when\nAnd if you're Brett Kavanaugh if you're married to him than I argue saying honey just do your job be a good judge and let's move on with life and I think\nSomething though that

like KPFK coming out of breath Angeles or\nWe have a ... in Grand Rapids back here we have a black AM radio talk show and sometimes I Can't listen to it because they just they're very\nAnd respect for the president I mean I didn't vote for Obama that I Would never talk about no I wouldn't have respect for the office of the president but sometimes they learn really good\nThings come down like I was listening to black [noise] talk show host and he was talking about are the same party here in Michigan and he was tying it to all the liberal Democrats were running for judges\nIn Michigan or do I usually don't vote project is because I don't know them that well but when he named the liberal jackets that they wanted on the Supreme Court here and get a nice okay those are the ones I Will not vote for\nBut those are the ones that said I'm not going that way since you're in Michigan the disturbance now is there a chance you might lose she she's such a clown is there I Know Debbie Stabenow is there a chance you might lose\n[noise] I don't think so she just I don't know she's telling that were and they you know Michigan I said I had to kind of half way Michigan is concerned in\nEastern Michigan hearing you know we got out of ... population we got a large black population make out a large democratic population over there and that's where she's out of their chances are for and\nYou know and I called up her office and said you know have you ever read the Koran and they don't have an answer and you'll and he asked for a letter back from her\nI Can't imagine a worst representative and Debbie Stabenow and she's running against a a black Republican is going to get a lot of African American vote or not\nBy hotel although um I did not vote for him because that right side of things about him getting\nMoney to certain people that I don't kind of agree with that because the last ... backed by Trump he got elected so um [noise] do you know we have a Muslim lady hit back here and it's running out of power for Senate because she's from Detroit and it largely Muslim now\n[noise] so um there's areas in Michigan like in Minnesota where [noise] um we don't have any choice people are not even running against or\nIt's unbelievable isn't it\n[noise] and you know we got a proposal on our ballot which is really interesting um [noise] because\nYou know they're they're trying to get away get away with redistricting thing because they think they are so they've Republicans at that moment [laughter] so are we next kid that proposal on the ballot now where they want to go to adjust Thirteen people that will be ... by the secretary of state randomly like\nRandom will be you know get petting on what effect ... state is a Democrat or Republican [noise] and they've got to pick like Thirteen people for decided Republican and for decided Democrat\nWhat you're going to be renters just look at John James I think John James has a shot at winning that seat it would be wonderful if this was an upset how anybody in Michigan to vote for Debbie Stabenow is\nBeyond me was continuous more along becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven ...

I I I Will say all but I Would guess that the vast majority of Democrats would be very happy to know conclusively that Brett Kavanaugh at salt swamp and that they would be very very disappointed\nOr if it could be conclusively proven that he got a call her and other words they are very happy they they would be very happy to serve up a a doctor for\nAn operate so to speak sure to their narrative sure\nAnd ... and shame on them if I could draw this parallel to the Duke lacrosse case out here\nAnd this was big news down air ... air light up up when it was absolutely conclusively proven that that woman at docked in rate you did not hear any expression of joy or leap or why at this\nShe had not been rate on the contrary the liberals really obviously had been hoping that she had been raped night ... and they were disappointed that do that has not been\nOne of the boys at a time of the rape had a picture taken him him at an ATM two miles away\nAnd and so you know Michael ... Fong lost his law law license the prosecutor and went to jail\nBut there was an remembered Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton raising money making sure the so called rape victim it free college tuition and now she's having prison time for like murder but but nonetheless there was no level of apologies\nFrom ABC NBC CBS the New York times CNN MSNBC and they simply moved on to the next circus the next carnival never offering sufficient apologies then there's three boys who was so brutally wrongfully accused somebody ... it was a joke what happened to them and the Hofstra boys\nOr what happened at UVA in Rolling Stone all of these hoaxes take place in the media just moves on to the next ...\n... ...\n... exactly people were actually disappointed that uh that woman had not been raped and now I'm sure probably most Democrats are very disappointed when it really occurred to them if they're honest with themselves that really Brett Kavanaugh had not falter\nOr not but it did not ... it was\nProven ugly falls based\nUpon their research done a professor forward after she testified every factual\nStatement you made was uncorroborated or refute it not one thing whether it was the door whether it was the air travel was it the timing was it the event itself whether her age none of it it's none of it fit facts\nBut that didn't keep the media ... continuing to slime him\n... ... ... and the point I Would make is a shame on anybody who was disappointed that this wind was not sexually assault\nThey wanted her to be sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh they wanted to be true didn't they\nThat's right they were hoping hoping against hope that she had been sexually assaulted and they hope that because it advance their liberal narrative just as in the Duke lacrosse case they were disappointed that woman had not been rate they were disappointed\nAnd remember the a writer named aerial do moss further Steven Kobe or Late Show on CBS today she tweeted quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote that's the mentality\nExactly that's where they're coming from and and shame on anybody and everybody who feels that way I Would ever my narrative it is is I Do I Will never be happy that someone else suckered in order for me to advance by narrative\nWhen the letter was happy that Brett Kavanaugh as his wife and children his mom and dad they're happy that he went through so much pain they had joy from the sorrow he's feeling on these false charges that makes this even ... types to be quite happy\nExactly and shame on all of them and we've got to teach them a lesson in about three or four my home we got to sweep these people out of office I don't care what\nWe got about ... vote you got to vote normal people go to vote Joe your weight on their age\nThank you\nThank you thank you Joe we've got to run thank you by the way the Houston Texans are about to kick the game winning feel go to beat up on the Dallas Cowboys Nineteen is sixteen and short feel go we'll see what happens let's continue with more forty six minutes after they are built Cunningham the great American live with you every Sunday night\n[noise]\n\nAre you putting your retirement savings and a four O. one K.

I don't know who he was I mean that there may have been captured I didn't see the caption but uh anyway so I guess he had to do it a couple of times\nNow he's one of those guys he puts his hands up and spreads his fingers when he says his oath\nRather than oh what does that mean that that say about it and that's where the hatred right there so we're we'll see the the Democrats may decide to attack him for that you know\nA justice Kevin now is already seated by chief justice Roberts on Saturday but tonight the first of all the swearing in ceremony\nFor the country to watch a stream of the White House it's seven pm eastern ended Democrats are reeling from defeat and they're refusing to give up bound to make their voices heard at the ballot box\n... leader Nancy Pelosi rallied the troops in this letter writing their colleague your democratic colleagues ... decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has wound and the very soul and justice in our country we must start agonizing less organized\nPeople must vote what is at stake in this election is nothing less than the health in financial security of families across\nAmerica and while the tumultuous confirmation battle ... on both sides that are still raw\nK everybody's angry now so I just I don't understand and I have plenty of friends on both sides of this issue that that have their opinions but I just don't understand when you start throwing due process out the window I I don't understand why people think that that's OK\nBecause if it was happening to somebody who they felt was you know aligned with their political views they they would they would be up in arms about it\nAll again go back to and it was a few years ago go back to the Duke situation where it was the Duke lacrosse team ... day now gender switched okay but but the deal is\nThese guys were were accused and kicked out of school may be certainly kicked off the team yeah without due process but nobody had anything to say about that you know but nobody wanted to talk about that well the due process was just the greed just for those people right as it was for cabinet if you want to look at that\nI mean we've already had the discussion about how college administrators and having to struggle with the idea of let's put a process in place because if we got a legal system you have to stand by the legal system right so and\nAgain Kevin all had been um investigated seven times for all these judicial situations coming up\nAnd there's so much and hey I get it we get it when you go to a business and you don't feel like you're being heard you get angry right as a customer you get angry well there are a lot of people out there on the street who don't think they're being heard right now so ...\nUh the problem is that kind of thing will probably get worse before it gets better\nAnd so go vote right yeah\nThat's that's what you need to do if you like if you like the way the government's doing things than go vote\nWhy why vote when you can go to restaurants and great people well they have to leave\nAnd and you know if you're going to allow that situation again if I'm a restaurant owner I think I kick those people out to get everybody out if they're going to run somebody out who's one of my customers then you can't stay in my restaurant I don't want you to write that has that's that's the that's the only fair so\nWe'll see where all that goes but it was enough to bring Taylor Swift out yeah Taylor Swift as decided to get political or good\nAll right so she has ... the on Instagram ... that she's backing Democrats of Phil Bredesen for the U.S Senate Jim Cooper for the U.S house in her home state of Tennessee in the midterms\nBeyond her endorsements she urged that every one vote saying for a lot of us we may never find a candidate or a party with whom we agree one hundred percent on every issue but we have to vote anyway\nYeah and I read the post 'em at literally just a couple of minutes ago 'cause it's it's on Twitter and I will say at least she has\nI mean she has good reason she explains why she cannot support Marsha Blackburn pay 'em and you know just kind of goes through why she is you know choosing to to vote this way so it's not one of those ... you know and not just because I'm a tailor\nFan but not just one of those celebrity like well this is that you know just kind of screaming at you it's very\nThis is why I'm voting this way I usually am not political but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years I feel differently about that now and then goes on to explain why she's voting I\nGuess there has to be a tipping point now does that influence you in one way or another would you vote for the same person just because you like Taylor Swift\nNo no I wouldn't and I I didn't really does something like that is ridiculous by the way that are that are just well I'm just saying I understand okay\nNo I wouldn't I mean I I did not just because she but I Will say she at least gave the very good argument to as to why she's doing um and then of course you know the whole thing just go vote it's and that's usually what you know most of them are saying you know this is what I'm doing I don't really care what you do but at least just go\nVote yeah one of the things that are the only time that ever impacted me was with a Ted dance and I quit watching cheers idea really because he was talking about save the whales and all\nThe and right and it's clear that yeah and I I stopped following certain celebrities on social media because they're too political and it seems like every post or every other post there just slamming down your throat what you should believe anyway this is just you know hey this is what I'm doing you know and and speaking out but\nSo a no it doesn't it doesn't necessarily affect me but I have\nStopped falling I haven't really stopped watching anything but I stopped following certain people on social media because it's just too much ...\nAnd when you're saying celebrities obviously we're we're really down there the totem pole but\nYeah and when you're saying celebrities obviously we're we're really down there at the totem pole but that being said you know I have a friend who is in radio and in a different market and\nConstantly I mean constantly taking the Twitter to post about about you know social things in in politics and I'm not saying that you can't do that and then there's not a time and place for that but I mean when all you do is just get on there and just gripe all day every day I hadn't followed them well we\nHave in fact we have some friends who ah live just outside of San Francisco and\nBasically we have just kinda quit communicating with them because\nThis will happen face to face when we'd go see them or they were here whatever they would immediately begin to politicize the conversation we aren't we weren't there for that we were there to be friends we were there to have a social interaction\nAnd to decide that you want to get into a political discussion I mean okay that's what you want to do then that's fine but but don't get upset about it yeah I have a different right and you and if I Want to interact with you anymore that would just say oh sad that's unfortunate but\nUh if if that's where they're going to go and maybe we're going to see more

same thing yeah you know they either using a ... percent a hundred dollars a right or hash tag ... so you go back and use the same thing over again and really what they've talked about now as we look

I don't think you've been listening very well and to go through what I Know and what I've always said and then you can correct the other media members have you on and I definitely want you to talk about it when you're making a really bad assumption here what I've said is the Democrats are running on the idea that if they get the house of representatives back\nThey will impeach the president impeachment doesn't need remove Bill Clinton was impeached he but he wasn't convicted impeachment is you bring articles of impeachment you alleged that they somehow\nData crime of of of impeachable substance which would be high crimes and misdemeanors\nYou bring those articles of impeachment in the house of representatives if the Democrats won the house they'd be able to do that then it would send it to the Senate and the Senate because it's still dominated by Republicans and doesn't have a sixty seven member majority\nThat would ever convict then the guy wouldn't be removed it would go away they would do this only the ... things up I Know exactly what impeachment is but\nYou sound like you're very knowledgeable guy maybe you could say it in a better way than I just did and I love for my listeners to hear it but please don't make an assumption that I'm using it wrong good\n\nWell I Am wrong if if it's exactly how you portray\nI have an oil yeah I've always said it that way always\nOkay in the ... court or impeachment trial is the United States Senate and the chief justice of the United States Supreme court presides over the trial guy in super majority of two thirds of the senators has to vote to convict\nYeah you'd have to have sixty seven as I said\nRight and ... Johnson was the first president each write one by one vote and then they'll Clinton was that I had no idea what to\nYet another vote tally on on that either but we did talk to Ken Starr a few weeks ago here and he was he was impeached he was actually ... and I and I ask Ken Starr was it because he lied under oath settled that plus the structure of of justice but more importantly it was um\nAbusive power was the main reason why a Bill Clinton was impeached and you're right it went to the Senate he was found not guilty\nCorrect in the ... the charges are trees bribery or other I ...\nWhich is kind of weird to to describe a high crime and misdemeanor I think that's I think the house of representative the Democrats think they've got Trump structures of justice because of what he allegedly said to me which again there's nothing there and on on cabin all I have no idea what they think they have other than potentially perjury\nUm in his testimony which can't be proven because I don't know how you go back to Nineteen eighty one to find out who's telling the truth or not\nOkay the only really get a pass on this is what I Do I I don't know don't don't don't say though it's perfectly fine it's actually understandable\nWhy you would assume that everybody in the media is doing the same thing because the vast majority of Americans John and I think you know this and it's why you called in they think when you say impeached means removed and it doesn't mean that at all which is just it's just started the process in the house that ends up in the Senate and it's very very hard\nTo impeach somebody and if the Republicans still have a majority in the Senate and they probably will after November it's going to go nowhere but I'm not really sure why\nIn the Senate and they probably will after November it's going to go nowhere but I'm not really sure why the Democrats think running on metal let me ask you this did you sound like a smart dude and I think you probably have a good answer to this do you think the Democrats are running on impeachment because most people think it means remove\nWell yes I Do I think the I think the Democrats do because I don't think they're smart enough to read history books or school or the beach\nBut it's probably true ah it's as simple as to Google to get they just haven't done it\nRight but uh and and this gives or for for the the the the Republicans to go out there and really fire up the vote so we make sure that we have the majority and then the house of representatives and we have a majority in the Senate\nSo you know this this hopefully will light a fire under all Ryan's and it's recalling throughout our butts out there to go out there are stark ... for the ... the Republicans that are running for office\nJohn I hear

living on a Boston which is interesting is I think he's right\nIt's almost unfortunate that this all went down a month before the election you know what I mean if it goes down two days before the election everybody's going to go and vote screw this am I going to deal with us again left right middle wherever the hell you are going to go and vote because it just wasn't right which is way down\nIt just wasn't right but now that it's a month out and and again\nLook I'm not going to give the Democrat talking points I might look ... do you want to do what they're doing because really dumb but I mean they have a month now to fix all of what they just harm and they just did a lot of harm to this country to our system read the ... the legitimately said\nThey literally said it does it matter at this point of view is innocent or guilty\nThink about that\nSpartacus actually said due process does it matter period and their story of a nice day\nEight nine four one ... ... we come back it's going to be um former governor of the great state of Alaska former vice presidential nominee for the United states of America she was on the ticket was John McCain and Sarah Palin listens to this program\nAh every day as you drop the kids off at school or picking them up and and we really are we enjoyed finding out that she likes to show on friday and I and join even more having a conversation with a not very long ago you're going to see it on television you're gonna hear it on radio and uh yes I Do ask her very directly\nYou planning on taking our Lisa Murkowski is twenty twenty two of his Senate seat that she now holds her answers are very interesting I mean the ... and again she's awesome and the scenery behind her I gotta get up to target to get to Alaska\nNative right near the animal back after this [noise]\nThat exactly right and Joe I'm breath because nobody else was talking about that but there are what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit outta\nFrancisco right now about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaska because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far the second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan\nAnd not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for at least to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous and the other thing is that\nTrump President Trump saw the lights and is allowing at our ally decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has in terms of resources to help our country become more\nEnergy independent that inherently between energy and security energy prosperity that's Anwar that's our oil and gas development here in Texas and elsewhere that Lisa would put that in jeopardy and gave that to her he gave that to her to Alaskans but it was through her\nAnd for I mean that was a a real nice thank you ... ...\n... it just it just says we're going to church or a pill and of course you know zero pay one I'm a I got to jump on that we are reliant on people in the middle East that don't necessarily like us\nWhy not going to and from what some of the geology subset of two hundred years were the world there in in war why wouldn't we going to become self reliant and turn the spigot all through these bad guys\nAnd by the way we should Murkowski voted no and when everybody watching and listening especially those of you in Alaska she voted no on Capitol\nOfficially it's an it's a Persian vote because later she changed it for dangerous going back to his daughter's wedding so she said I'm just going to vote president disorder counterbalance when they would have been but she on the record in the first round should know\nLiteral I'm absolutely so that's that's typical political ... that's a typical politician wanting to kind of play both sides if she truly had a problem with Kavanaugh\nBeing on the bench and she said he's not the right man for the bench than she her boat then at the final vote what reflected that instead of saying oh well I Do this because it's not really count anyway we don't really believe something if you have that talk with pointing due north\nKnowing what the right thing is to do then you fight for that but instead very wishy washy and she learned you know in the middle of the road\nGet hit on both sides directly\nRights is or a villain the former of our soldiers ... for the Republican Party to vote was also the former governor reached native of Alaska in just a great person and I love the we're having this conversation are you going to take Iran because your tweet might have been the best we're there we're seeing\nThis entire year ah it was a Lisa Murkowski I can see twenty twenty two from my house talk right is that going to happen\nYou know the only thing that keeping me from just being close to the wall enthusiastic about the idea is twenty twenty two so far away though that that yeah I mean that's almost frustrating looking\nThat far what were some like me who's always preaching to people stand up make a difference Jake the gifts and talented opportunities God's created for you and\nThe different well you know I Can't just keep preaching it and not jumping and also at some point one of these positions I Would so desire serving of this country and we'll see where that goes Hey Joe before I forget yeah sure what we're talking about the second amendment on which\nJudge Kavanaugh is he's he's absolutely pro constitution right here academic Lisa hesitating Leigh voted for President Obama's tax on different judicial\nPositions including how to get there on the DC circuit she pro abortion totally anti gun anti commonsense constitutional is cheap and we had no problem at all\nSo she can to to um exercise back to vote 'em up and down it was always up\nFor Obama's picks but wouldn't give that same respect and I think consideration for\nA good man like Kavanaugh says another problem that Lisa has an impact is that\nWe had many never Trump hers around her with an upper and um she hired a lot of never Trump first then has hired a lot of never Trump ... and some of these folks you know we keep warning him about you can't win them over there going to continue to undermine and that's quite unfortunate for the ... movement\nBut why did we were given are under her name is just to get the votes in Alaska hoping that people won't pay attention to the record what you just said just now in the past minute would tell me I can never vote for\nYeah a ... and that is why yeah that are by the name I mean that that it's a consummate right oh yeah\nAbsolutely right at your opinion was the vice presidential nominee and also the food donated retreated Alaska jury in a moment to have left I I Would be remiss if I didn't go back to how you and your family were treated by the media when you were announced it and I imagine that some days in my life that really when I was told my family I just succeeded in doing something\nI could imagine when you told John McCain want you to be the vice presidential nominee almost like Brett Kavanaugh being told\nDonald Trump want you to be able to record it's gotta be jubilation it's got to be unbelievable Julian and high fives in Delhi bumps and and much left\nAnd then all of a sudden the media says one of the gutter mission dozens and dozens of people to find anything they possibly can on using committed was cabinet can you relate to what are you must have gone through in the past month I'm guessing you can\nYeah absolutely and you're right um you know the Obama administration and the media they sent up dozens and dozens and dozens and it was\nRight here where I'm standing right now in my yard voted early in the yard to find anything but um yeah I can relate the thing that I disagree with judge Kavanaugh on is a proclamation that it has devastated or destroyed the family\nNo it doesn't destroy your family your circle the wagons it it actually um you can use it to get out there all that that um the marking that lies told about you\nKnow and really use it as empathy for other people who go through a bunch of crap in this world because everybody does\nUm use that to power you to get out there and do the right thing and it's like really really hard for the underdogs like really hard for those who don't have that platforms that microphone to speak up for justice\nTo ensure apparently the last question and thank you for doing this\nI just have to know as you see the left becoming even more on ... when you hit the national spotlight it was ten eleven years ago now I'm ... and it was a new show ready but now it's ridiculous doing people literally scratching if the Supreme Court door as it did you get in and stop him from being sworn in they've done completely nutty\nHow do you counter balance that and how do we get the voices 'cause I think the majority of Americans aren't like that\nHow do we get the voices of the normal people among us to to rise to the top again or is that is that a really hard get because the media\nIs showing joined the ratings are getting from showing these idiots\nWell yeah I mean there's a triple threat against us that the media the opposing party and then rhinos within our own party letting this happen like that so\nUm you know it's free against one but no we are already made manifest I think our need for a change in the system and um the corruption in the lack of accountability in twenty sixteen when it was\nCertainly talk about the man as a person but\nThat Trump movement where the people stood up and said enough is enough that's quote dotted go will make a difference but it's funny a couple of my girlfriends and I were texting the last couple of days during the the cabinet discussion going on in our little group of girlfriends out there that we\nProtested like these radical [laughter]\nA girlfriend that we would like these rats [laughter]\nYou know we haven't gone I\nThink that the you know no more become onions I I think the more that reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we said enough is enough of that and we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back\nWe're going to follow the constitution hockey season's all about\nLimiting government that we can govern ourselves and I know I think people like that but that could be out there every day in the arena making a difference where you guys do you\nOkay we're going to do that is there a ... million along with millions of other Americans I voted for you two thousand eight I'd vote for you in a heartbeat again I really appreciate you reach out and thanks for taking the time today\nThank you so much cricket you back after this is Joe ... shows decorator\n[noise]\n... says yo filed chef\n\n\nThere is nobody on
