lot of people would have you heard on this a lot of people have an opinion on this let me go to the phone lines in Salem welcome to our Charles in San Antonio Charles what's up\n[noise] ... looting I I I wanted to look at that you know that I was twenty\nBut same circumstances you did\nWith my old man medium didn't see eye to eye but\nEventually I worked it out before we you know he passed on but then my mom was left widowed at so that's why I stayed right and it wasn't until my sister had divorced and she moved back here with her you know that's why I stayed so long but it's true what they said\nI think a lot of these people are saying that every marriage is not I don't even know why anybody gets married anymore because it doesn't last so that's my opinion\nBut no we broke up when you said how old you are when you moved out how old were you\nI was twenty eight\nRights which one of the Internet you moved out of twenty you because you won't get along with your dad\nNo no I I I I stayed because I was in college I had to live\nUnder the under their rules writer I liked it or not right okay so I was forced to swallow my pride but then me and my dad started working it out and then that surely he passed away when I was twenty six ... at that point you know my mom was widowed by herself I stayed with her and tell my sister got divorced and then you know she moved back in\nAnd your and my mom not area you know\nOh yeah oh yeah why not remarried already for thirty five year yeah the last thirty five year\nAll right so you're saying the difference between our generation to generation now is that today they're saying why even bother because nobody stays together ... but you obviously you're an example if somebody does\nExactly but now that everybody shares our beliefs believe it or not especially the millennials especially the Obama below the oh\nWhy don't I don't know I've been taught not to because the belief system used to be pretty universal this country suddenly we're raising a generation of people that just don't even have that same values as to its weird it's Charles things for the phone calls it's very odd to me it just ... we're we're in a different place now let me go to a Cody Minnesota Tony what's up\n[noise] hey how's it going man living dream dude what's up yeah gets\nAll comments for yet so I'm I was thinking to myself and kind of an example you know before I really wanted to really meet anybody I wanted to figure out myself first right\nYou know go to school start a business get a good job all that stuff move out kind of get settled in and then start looking however while you're starting to see a lot of millennials you know and myself\nYou know you have all these apps on the phone all the dating apps it's like you can just shop you know for whatever you're looking for you can go on a date um meet somebody you know and you can decide yeah this person's color of his personal life and they kinda just move on you know and it's interesting that actually after I got all off of all of this crap\nI'm you know I met somebody organically and I'm probably marry this woman\n... what does organically look like you're twenty Eighteen how do you meet somebody off of digital ... solution kind of\nJust like your I Would say like just through your friends\nYou know you know somebody who knows somebody else who was on you know one of these dating apps and they're just kind of striking out or you know they're just sick of kind of get to play it and you just kind of meet somebody who has gone through the same thing as you write or like well let's get off this crap let's just go out together have a good time and see where it goes\n... or any kind of have to go you kind of have to\nGo through you know going out ... I'll tell you at nine times out of town a millennial they've been on one of these apps for some period of time and after they kind of experience it and realize that there's not much good stuff out there they get off of it and then they just need people\nThe way that people use to me you know through friends hanging out a\nLoan that's the ... in my opinion\nI oh gotcha and I hear you and I think that people should do it organically like that you actually meet somebody face to face\nOr you meet somebody you work you meet somebody I mean it used to be a church right or you meet somebody ... you actually meet somebody you get to get to see the look on their ... their facial expression when they're writing to you were ... you know you get to hear the shark casual you get to see the way they smile or there's a twinkling her I just it's the old way you're doing it\nBut I guess in today's day and age and of course I've never been one of these dating apps but you could swipe one way do you like the person's wipe the only way to get rid of them I mean it's it's it's it's kind of mess we use it as\nIt is I don't know how they do and I don't I don't like that I don't know how you date today doing all that I'm On social media and again and shoving [laughter] no I don't like it\nWell who who says that the pictures real anyway they shop couldn't care to Brazil again what do they actually meet somebody and then figure out of your attracted or if you like to have a little bit more and that's an I imagine a cup of coffee or something it'd be Cruz's old fashioned Ninety I like it\nWould be very quickly go to a CD or going to be accused of city and Patrick that's got like a minute make it up and\nI Know where Joe thanks for having me on your job you know I I was ... I was born in eighty one I've been married Thirteen Years who my brother was born in eighty eight I'm going to say somewhere between Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty eight we started telling kids that you can get participation groceries in sports in life\nAnd your ... your work doesn't matter for an outcome so they have unrealistic expectations of what their new place to look like\nAnd they just moved drop their parents delay until they get what they think work than they are and it takes 'til they're twenty eight or thirty eight that is what it takes\nWell clearly in your house that was the time when I don't know about the timeline everywhere but I think that makes a lot of sense redo something has changed to where you know ... it went from practice as hard as you can and you'll be able to really trophy and whatever sport it is that you chose or you know a few years later it was just going to show up and if you don't get a trophy all yell at the\nThe coaching will shoot a lead something there changed his mother executive who wants to do with it it is edited nine four one package and it eight nine four one Seventy four seven what the hell's going on with the stock market we talked to a raging could associates\nDo gambling when we come back to the Joe ... Joe ... he'll be in a job at the gym ... [noise]\nIn consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet and in that regard I have to tell you this is really\nProfound two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in in income or into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred\nTrillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales we've ever seen ever restaurants are seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash\n'em but you know what the media does the media has to find if ... if it bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's where they are leading with it but when people generally watch it when you when you talk to your investors the people that that you work with or do they call you immediately say oh my God what are we do or or did they say wow that's kinda crazy going to go out to eat now\nYeah so [laughter] you know what I mean nobody causes nobody calls me with their dinner plant [laughter]\nI'm gonna I'm gonna from now on [laughter] but I Would say that I call 'em\nSo I Do get some people are concerned of course in that apprehension that's obvious and makes sense logical also get folks on the other side that are looking to do some buying\nBut let me give you a little perspective so the market bottomed in March of oh nine so I was following the meltdown of a late night we've had this is this'll be the twenty third but we've had twenty three now correction sense over nine five percent or more and they average I sent this out the clients this morning just to give some perspective [noise]\nTwenty three times since nine that what we're going through right now is happen average decline is nine point three percent\nWere down about ... almost seven now um but even today Joe I'm now seeing on my screen as I'm watching a in real time we're starting to see some of the stocks the leaders ah which were technologies of the names we all know Amazon Microsoft Apple Facebook companies\nUm we're down early today bend down hard this month but now starting to sure I mean Facebook as an example and this is not a recommendation on Facebook but the stock was in August\nBetter over two hundred and ten dollars a share today is traded on the one fifties now it was read earlier down on the day but now it's green Microsoft same thing it was lower early today now that's turned up so it looks like\nWe're starting to see a little bit of selective buying the average stock or this ... needle is moving but the average stocks since this sell off happened is down about Fifteen Percent well\nPretty big correction yeah now here's the thing to you mentioned this it kind of in passing is too expensive is it over done\nThe market is trading at about the price to earnings ratio which that's just simply the price divided by earnings about sixteen probably right that a sixteen point to sixteen twenty three twenty five year average sixteen point one\nSo it's right words in Detroit where ... years yeah you're not cheap so it's not like oh nine when everything was on sale but you're certainly not at twenty three twenty four times what you're saying jeez\nWere forty percent overvalued now we're smack at the twenty five year average rate now\nIt is I Do gather managing director and senior vice president Raymond James and associates or always incredible knowledge let me ask you something off the beaten path and you know for Twenty one years no do you tell me the most smartest you so you're about to prove it here I'm\nLiterally as partly I Would I Do write a gas prices go down we're happy gas prices go down because the price per barrel goes down so we're happy with the gospel\nWith the price of rebel goes down with the stock market generally speaking goes down and we're all supposed to freak out be angry that that the stock market is going down so\nAgain maybe maybe this is completely outlandish but should we get to the point to where we don't have these valuable resources\nLike gasoline like liquefied natural gas like\nPhil ... you know I'm I'm utility that we all need\nMaybe we don't have those in the stock market and the reason why I say that is we're happy when the prices go down with the prices will go down in the stock market goes down is I Would guess and it could be wrong but it's rare to see the price per barrel of gas go down and the stock market go up\nSo how do you feel as somebody who does this for a living and you've done for as long as I've known you when you do it very well\nHow do you feel about those being connected is it right just to have gasoline per barrel and the stock market or or not because again it seems to be the opposite of what I Want I Want lower gas prices but I Want my stocks to do well\nYeah it's a ... that's an interesting question so you you really can't a separate those for a couple of different reasons a number one is you have companies like\nChevron and Exxon as an example yeah I'm right there publicly traded so they're going to be on the exchange just like home depot and apple are going to be on the exchange you have that\nThe commodity itself um oil in this case or natural gas as you were mentioning those are a inputs of course into a lot of different products\nThose are the importance of course it a lot of different products right and so you have to have a market price and you know if you look at commodities you can buy cattle hogs oil natural gas platinum played in whatever it's all out there with a price\nI Wonder I Wonder I Want to interject this though 'cause I I see where you're going to make sense but like you brought up apple let's talk about apple I've got an iPhone or I Want to go by the new iPhone right\nAn apple stock dumped today Fifteen Percent they're not going to drop the price of the iPhone tomorrow because their stock price went down but at the price per barrel of oil goes down to the stock prices go down to those old companies I Am going to pay\nPay less for it at the gas from there so I guess my question is is it okay\nRight yeah okay so the or let the lithium battery\nLittle smarter than you thought I was a it actually makes no sense whatsoever and I'm trying to [laughter] come on who are looking at O'Hare ruby back oh come on yeah yeah yeah so\nThis is the U.S dissect the iPhone for an example we all know they have lithium batteries yeah so let's see him as a commodity right um so that's been a straight up and down just like crude oil that's part of the cost structure for Apple now they might do things to hedge that\nInput cost it they think lithium prices are going to run away to the upside because they don't want the iPhone going for um a thousand twelve hundred just because the battery went up by two hundred but right um so\nIt's a hard question to answer I think the short answer is no uh oil is part and parcel to the equation\nA book just as the rock ... and then all of the derivatives of that which are directly ... energy companies but then more broadly a plastic on an iPhone right yeah well guess what that comes from where oil right so it's just it's it's just there\nWas the apple is in effect that I think the right answer is from the dumb guy perspective here the right answer is apple already mark set up by a hundred percent so if they're only making Ninety five percent markup I think they're still going to be okay and that really is true it cost them exactly half\nOf what of what they're charging for an iPhone so I guess where you've got that kind of wiggle room you can you can survive in the next time we speak give me your favorite let's talk about why\nThe price per barrel of oil is it lower for us specifically when we're exporting now more than we've ever exported and we're actually exporting now more than we're importing\nOut a great question from a call yesterday who said we're we've got all this oil why we keep on exporting it will just keep it refunded ourselves and I know that it's a it's a global market that's why but maybe you can break down exactly how that works next time can we do that\nYeah you bet that's eating All right it is a duck or it's not easy easy is not easy for them for the layman over here All right if the guy but he's the managing director senior vice president of investments Raymond James and associates Doug always right knowledge thanks man\nJoe my pleasure back after this with Joe ... stay right here\n[noise]\n[noise] ... yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]

W. College Station Bryan glad to have your long\nFor the ride Kanye West goes to Washington goes off in a rant um uh I found most of it was coherent Cary what you heard you say you thought it was coherent yeah\nSo why is it that those who want to oppose the fact that he even\nLikes the president ... why do they tried to pretend like he just wasn't even coherent look listen to what he said and then discuss it debated argue about it that's cool that's the American way but the the way the left is well what do you have to say doesn't make any sense therefore we don't have to comment that he should be banned from society\nAnd it's kind of what happens right yeah I'll bet I'll bet\nIt eight nine for one pack a day to day nine for once every two four seven ... just so you know I could not tell you a song that Kanye West has ever done other than the one we're Jamie Fox assuming like Ray Charles very well by the way a bigger yes all of a sudden is there another kind of a sudden I should know\nI mean there quite a few of them out there I'm\nMeeting one but I Would say oh well that's really\nYeah I mean he did that one son Jesus Walks um\nAnd there's some kind of paranoia here I'm Single bit of before and\nRight [laughter] well [laughter] I Would pay for their fellows thank God why can't those little\nAnd then paint for your ... why can't those little ... what is it what does he call themselves ... or something what's it called him so easy 'cause you know ... you can also call themselves and uses\nOJ yes and he was going to run in twenty twenty but I guess twenty twenty fours when he'll run for president now so I'm assuming they weren't getting ... ... because he loves to Trump's there yeah\nSo so there you go I mean it was it was easy to understand what he said today now if you disagreed with it let's argue about it if you agreed with it let's let's talk about it if you think it was incoherent and not understandable but some of that conversation too I I don't think those people will call him though because this is what happens on the far liberal left would they do is they say\nIt's understandable he was on drugs he's a a house negro\nAnd um or even worse and worse I'm ... and therefore he should be disregarded in other words no brain space needs to be taken up in my head by what I'm ... said because it's a legitimate what he said because I say so mellow go about by\nYou know anti for life or whatever the because of the phone lines to see what you've been gone this eight eight nine four one\nPegs editing nine for one Seventy four seven then what's going on I\nCan hear it I can which habit of\nHey just wanted to kind of bounce off the the idea and it can be west or it could be a cabinet why don't the conservative sue for ...\nIn what way but I\nJust well I mean like Kavanaugh for example which is more extreme you know\nWhy I mean they they claim or there were there were more or less yeah even though he was guilty for something that he didn't do\nRight they if they if they can die as they should be sued now if they sue\nYou know as far as liberals in general have to think twice before trying to bring up this garbage without any real proof\nBut it's a good question I'm going to get through this way Kavanaugh does have a case you're right they said you are a rapist you are a gang rape if your a serial rapist you are a filling the blankets\nHe has every right to sue sweating they're keeping sue I have an oddity he can sue anybody and everybody who's involved in that but there is there's a fine line when it comes to a public figure suing like if somebody says ... racist\nAs much as that's incorrect I probably couldn't sue them in and when because that's their opinion now they say you're a racist I saw you wearing a white hood lighting a fire you know across on fire in front of a black families house now I can sue them for something specific they said I did you see what I mean\nThe fall so it's all done or freedom of speech well it does in your opinion it has a lot of latitude so you can say that you think that I'm you know no good SOB but until you say I I saw Joe\nPacks Rob a bank or rape or person then I Would have something that I could actually sue on um that would be something specific so saying the ... house negro is not suitable saying that Brett Kavanaugh gang raped a bunch of women that is syllable you see the difference yeah\nDefinitely I'd rather I appreciate in open line now edited nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy four seven I mean that really is how it works and there's a lot of latitude for people in their opinions especially when it's somebody who puts themselves out there is a public figure like your Kanye West and now he's super Supreme Court justice as well or or somebody you know but as\nLow level celebrities I Am I'm ... I also\nCan't really sue somebody for their opinion on my show\nNow they say that I specifically did somebody broke a law or they say you know they saw me you know at at at at the bar engage in sexual activity whatever oh now I can say well specifically you said I did something that's patently untrue I now sue you for X amount of money for for libel and slander or punitive damages\nAnd that really use the way it works unfortunately and fortunately our First Amendment rights do allow us to have an opinion but but if you cross that line from opinion to accusation now you've got something like I've seen as a million times scared you have somebody come\nIn and paid your house mhm and and you pay that person you had a contract that the job got done you're unhappy about the job you have every right to go and Yelp or wherever else and leave a review and say I just don't like how they did it\nThat's not syllable can that hurt their business yes now if you say they came to pay my house and they stole you know my find China if you can't prove that now they've got something that's either slander reliable your defending them somehow saying that their actual fees which is a breaking the law\nIt's it's an interesting fine line it's one that again I think is good and and it's not as good let me go to the phone lines and say Hi to um Rudy in San Antonio really what's going on high\nPay how you doing Joe limited remain what's happened\nHey just more prove their that CNN I mean at mainstream media that like I said I've been saying that the enemy of the people I mean they pay you they use their left Israel however they want to write\nBut then they forget their own rules okay first remember a band aids and warm and they were making\nFun of a white people yeah you got a job and your games right\nYes yes okay they said oh well you know it's fine because she's a minority making fun of white people it's All right you know I saw a couple of articles like that it it it shouldn't matter right because why people are so privileged right and then and that's okay but now what are they going to say\nYou've got black people talking about black folk calling calling names that I don't even want to repeat\nWhat is what what's gonna happen I'm not I'm not hearing anything about her left their\n... nothing happened because he uh he got he got off the plantation\nSo they're mad at him and they get him back if he's back of the plantation if tomorrow he says hey I met with the president and he's you know good guy with small hands and he smells and and uh oh you hit on my wife\nThen he was suddenly be back in the fold he has to get back in line or else he's not going to get the kind of are the kinds of treatments that that he deserves used as a human being anyway it eight nine for one pack Joe ... dot com we come back then beyond you know former Secret Service agent now author is going to be on the program\nWe got here somehow I didn't see it coming you didn't see it coming because then you and I always knew that there were people on the other side we can have a\nOr you know a drink at the bar or go in and play some some basketball and and mix it up a little bit of a you know debating you know in our way but you can't do that anymore there's no debate if you and I say we trust this president we like what he's done the responses they knew no good you're something over something is and your excommunicated from society\nHow did we get here it is there a way back\nWell I I Love the Athens 'cause I have a theory it's called the political grenade theory OK\nHere's what's happening and here's why the Democrats are completely lost their mind that when I think Democrats I Want to be clear here I Am not talking about heartland American voting Democrat Ron talking about loony tune activists and swamp rats that just because\nI don't like them and they do that but I did I think that's clear yet right yeah\nBut the looney tunes that have gone crazy and here's the reason the political grenade in the past what had happened with the Republican Party and the Democrats the activist groups in the media for up all these he'll people slump I Would throw a political grenade on the battlefield for any issue it doesn't matter John ... health care taxes right it would be\nYou're a racist you don't like all you want to kill grandma you want to write you know you're in for the rich you're taking money from poor people\nThe Republicans see the political grenade come in they're terrified they all panic and only a few warriors are left behind in the battlefield\nThat Ted Cruz is the Rand Paul the Mike leave the gym Jordan's right but they are out there all along and they're overwhelmed\nAnd eventually the Republican Party just learn to be helpless not those guys but the other guy what happened with Trump everything change Joe\nYou and I streak out you know yeah I Know how it is you don't want to be in a God Forbid a gang fight with you and you're the only guy and the guy right road right now has said I Am not leaving the battlefield no matter what he sees the political grenades coming in he chews on them he eats them for breakfast\nRight any through some of them right back and now all of a sudden the Democrat this is how this thing wraps up the Democrats don't know how to respond because they've never been in the war of attrition before politically ever well always had easy victory\nI think what they what they thought was going to happen to begin to stand bones you know the O N G I you know go and get his books by gave you tempted sabotage Donald J Trump I think they expected the cabinet would pull his his nomination out\nI think they thought that Trump would have would have been nominated him and go with somebody else and what happened was that street fight was no longer just one dude now it was a group of Republicans that say well hold on a second if we've got a guy was back bone in the White House\nWe can go ... go ahead and stick to our guns and Kevin I said I'm going to stick to my guns to another gang rape is I've never done any of this stuff\nBut but the the modus operandi is you just explain was the attack they attack they attack and they throw the grenades and then it blows everything up and then Trump says okay let me give you a moderate guy maybe I'll I'll put a mirror Garland to somebody\nAbout this guy was going to back down I mean that's the change I see no\nRight when you break up a good point here why would why would the media the activist group in the swamp rats that Trump was going to fall back on ... on the supportive of cabinet maybe put up like a\n... or someone else because that's what happened in the past right one every time right and and when he didn't and he not only doubled tripled down and then Mitch McConnell listen I'm not I haven't been a huge fan of match but credit where credit's due McConnell's like\nNo we're voting and you guys could either get on the train or get run over by Democrats in the media are like they're they're they're in the ... party screaming at the sky on at\nThe Supreme Court or they don't know what to do so in that whole scene was no well I've got to tell you I never thought that I Would say this but Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell suddenly or a couple of bad as what happened I God I\nI I I don't I Trump happen from but you're right I mean Lindsey and and I mean he he was called Lindsey Graham is you've done while right and and he had he becomes this\nFlame thrower up on the hill and you know listen to it I said to my pod cast and they said repeatedly that\nYou know we shouldn't be like the left the left words to act cohesive late right and they know where their soldiers have expertise\nAnd ... grams going to be good on Supreme Court stuff then those are the soldiers we got to go into the fight with them we got to leave the battles behind it's just really for us to you know to continue to to pick off our own why the Democrats are trying to throw Trump under the bus it's insane\nIt's banned bungee no B O N G I you know go and get his book it's called Spygate the temperate sabotaged of John of Donald Trump you also see on TV all the time you're on Fox all the time and you got your shows on TV some congrats on that I got to ask you your your thoughts when Kanye going to the White House\nAnd and I thought that what he said today made since the leftist pretending what you was incoherent wasn't he actually wants more jobs in the inner city you once dads and households he wants to do just to do well in Nike not so much and he likes the president for God's sakes\nI'm so I don't really know what was wrong with them but the left immediately started calling in my house negro you love to go even uncle ... it's just going to Scott's\nThing panel I have ever seen in my life right Corey sellers in Paris at my right I I never in my life seeing such a Joe listened to me yeah I I

... writes host the panel where they call this guy a house negro and then they then they make fun of a very serious mental health issue this guy I mean it was the most\nDisgusting horrible thing I've ever seen on television and you know what\nI I tip my hat the con yet I someone came after me they said well you were to object when Taylor Swift know what I objected to about tell us what was tell us

directly to the book do you believe as we sit here talking live right now on a Thursday that without a doubt the Obama administration and the deep state did everything they could to derail this president bolt\nEver taking office and once he was in office getting rid of all\nI have absolutely no doubt if you read the book\nYou'll see that that narrative down Donald Trump with that as far back it now than it wow that people were involved in back in two thousand seven not all the political player but some of the media wants already had the narrative ... yeah it was a disaster but yeah I

it more for storage and warehouse\nSo that is where all of our actors the props the clothing wardrobe is all backstage\nThen we have a nice little office area which which gives us a beautiful dividing wall and then into the auditorium so we had the beautiful Nineteen seventies carpet ripped up we painted the inside black\nAnd had a wonderful stage built by Mr dean Cofer and Larry and sale and some

new facility but right now but but it's a begs the question when you talk about\nThe audience being right there with the performers it also works the other way around the performers are right there with the audience and so you've had a ... a week for performances what's been the feedback from the actors\nOh they love it also ah they can you know in our in our other theater you were pretty close also it was still a very intimate theater\nOn the stage is not as tall so the actors are low or so they're almost on an airplane with the audience\nOr it's not a ground it is it is a lifted stage but the actors are loving it also they can hear the audience when they laugh thinking here and when they gas\nWhen it's something that you know a shocking to them and that's one thing about live theater we feed off the audience so if it's a funny line we deliver and nobody laugh\nIt hurts ... says but we carry on we keep going so you know one thing about it uh we can feel the energy from the audience and that\nAnd the actors do play off of that and Harvey is a wonderful to have for a season opener we sold out last night we had to turn people away so we encourage people get your tickets on

is the son of three weekends to Harvey is going to be the center I bought to pick your brain a little bit about how you how you all decided this was going to be ... production to open up a new building\n[laughter] it kind of came by accident because originally when we signed the lease in April we thought this would be a quick turnaround and we'd be in there in may well it didn't work out that way because of the city and permits and building and you know it took a little longer\nSo we actually decided to go ahead and finish our season\nWhere we currently we're which was the third floor cantina location\nAnd open the new season in the new facility we thought it was just\nThat was the way to go and uh we're so thrilled and Chaz is a wonderful director and the cats this just

healthcare freedom backs or costs go down and make sure we balance the budget and then get Washington out of the way it affected them will be a whole lot better\nOr ... what are you in good shape is All right now because the ... again it was going to be a blue wave in the house in the Senate ban it started with only ... percent it wasn't going to go blue in fact we probably will gain two or three or four Republican seats if things go away it looks right now the house\nIt probably will gain two or three or four Republican seats if things go away it looks right now the house bill is a toss up ... what are your feelings on this I feel confident you're going to win but I Wonder when they lose it was in this area to go and vote either early voting on election day don't don't take anything for granted but I feel confident that you're going to win\nWhat's it going to take to ensure that you've got a house of representatives that doesn't go the wrong way and the wrong way it's just what you said\nNo more tax cuts in fact was repeal them I'm an Obama Care it's going to stay put let's impeach the present let's impeach Kavanaugh it I don't know what the hell they're running um it's getting them any traction but um what what is it that you could say right none of those watching and listening across the country\nWould ensure that the conservative base to you and I want to get out there gets out there\nWell I'll tell you I've been out going across the district talking to people nonstop for the last ten months in particular the last several and I can tell you the enthusiasm over the last two to three weeks in light of that sort of the show I represent a minute ago in the Senate\nCommittee is extraordinary the American people particularly here in Texas\nAre really fed up with what they're seeing out of the Democrat left progressive agenda that's completely out of lockstep with everything they believe are Texas values run deep that's why a thousand people a day are moving to Texas Governor Abbott his right to joke about building a fence on our western in northern borders and\nThe reality is it's like the woman I talked to in burning just down the road from where you live the other day it came up to me she didn't mean nice contributions that ship you've got to win to make sure that we control the house in Texas is protected you know I got nowhere else to move and I just moved here from California two weeks ago yeah\nWe'll get it they understand that the opportunity you have in Texas to thrive in the ... and to have prospering to pass something down your kids are so great so I feel optimistic I Can't predict what's going to happen in the house that this much right now\nIn Texas we had a million Democrats show up to the first time in the primaries in March but as you know and I think you've talked on your show about a million and a half Republicans showed up yeah\nYou are job than Texas will send a message not just the taxes and the rest of the country but to the world that we're going to continue to be the vanguard for liberty and make sure that we are not just expand the Senate hold the house and then get busy a truly taking advantage of this opportunity with a president willing to challenge the status quo\nIt such a pricey HIV last name or a why go and vote for him district Twenty one he's running for a Lamar Smith St Lawrence had that she for over Thirty years or what's interesting is you brought up a cabin on hearing is a couple of times and that's important because\nUh when the economy is so good and we've got more money in the bank and we're going out to eat more often were spending more money at at a big box stores and we're seeing these numbers are off the charts people get fat and happy and they're not why would I go and vote things are going great but I don't think they realize\nThat would be the ramifications the consequences if they don't get off their hands and go and vote do you think the Democrats chip overplay their hand and the Senate Judiciary committee I Am Spartacus and interrupting and yelling and screaming and bringing up allegations that are uncorroborated did they just light a fire under Democrats are under Republicans\nI really believe that they let the fire and the Republicans\nFrankly was badly needed for the reasons you start taking like Republicans were getting a little bit set and saying well we're doing well this is great\nYou know and they're kind of in that mid term diligent and the Democrats did a better job of anybody of lighting a fire in the Republican by overreaching and not just reaching in the Senate Judiciary committee where they definitively did unfairly and undermine the process and unfair to cabin on probably really an\nOscar for yeah they overreach but it's also the overreach by candidate Kennedy's like better or candidate like my opponent and the Texas Twenty one who are running as a valid ... progressive socialist on agendas that are about impeaching Trump higher taxes\nMore spending less border security for government run health care for more gun restrictions for more funding for Planned Parenthood my opponent has all of that on his website you don't have to take my word for it and I would encourage anybody listening go looking back on its website is it is and have vowed progressive liberal Democrat\nAnd they overreach because they thought they could drive for a this midterm election with progressive policy and Texans like they always do are going to stand up and say not in our back yard we love freedom\nYeah but how does anybody chip to me that's a winning combination I I Am I'm open to abolishing ice let's open the border I'm Robert Francis or work I don't call them that the whatever nickname he's calling himself he's not Hispanic he's a fourth generation Irish American nothing wrong with that but he use of the bumper stickers only see PTO which doesn't make sense to me\nUm this guy actually said and there's a piece of video but I saw just yesterday\nSome time ago he said we basically stole half of Mexico from them\nI mean this is this is who you're dealing with how is it a winning combination to to proud Texans how is it a winning combination the proud Americans who really believe that we're a sovereign nation and it's OK love our nation\nYou know it's definitively not a winning combination I think that's why we're seeing the recent polls for Senator Cruz them in now getting back up to at least ... eight nine ten point lead right in New York Times poll and ms online poll and others and I think we're going to see that hopefully across the state and across the country\nI think they were betting on the fact that they had some sort of anti Trump mid term ability to galvanize their forces into drive out to thousands sixteen turn out to a Web you know people like a level that came out for a Hillary Clinton on the other side of the aisle I Will say that to the cautioned all your listeners\nIf we do our job as conservative Americans conservative Texans and show up to vote across the country not just here and we just you got a conservative joy\nWe'll do fine but there are banking on Republican staying home and Democrats turning up in ways so they ran a hardcore progressive drive out their base agenda that out a lockstep with the vast majority of Americans and I hope that overreach will shine clear\nIt's ... I Believe he's the only choice industry Twenty one for a United States house of representatives it'll ... last last question\nAre you like me do you think some of the center left people some people blue dog Democrats are just as happy as the rest of us are about the economy and just as happy about the direction of our country and and but it's okay to wave of American flag and say usa usa usa again I mean we're really talking about a far left fringe Alyssa mulatto Beto O'Rourke\nBought a bronco bomber sort of of left that thinks that everything that's going on his bed right I mean you know Democrats you know blue dogs I mean these people actually quietly are going I'm going to vote the way the way it is to keep it the way it is because things are going pretty well\nThere is no question I've ... I've seen that throughout the district and throughout the state is I've been talking to a Texan\nThat they're they're really turned off by this sort of anti American field up they know what the the politics are behind it with salt as I mentioned in the Capitol hearing and they're and they're kind of retrenching event and saying look you know I I'm not comfortable with that importantly Joe you'll agree with that I think I Believe that we've got an impressive moment and opportunity right now\nTo re enough unify our country around our shared belief system that the federal government should be small and state governments and people in power if you want to unite our country and then stop one size fits all solution is Washington\nLet taxes taxes like California ... California so it won't be any others throats and ds clay politics so you're not watching meet the press with bated breath about what Washington is going to do for us to do what we knew best in Texas\nLive our lives and we're not telling everybody what to do then we won't be in each other's throats\nYou're actually suggested as attempt amendment that says we can do our own thing to a job I appreciate you I I I appreciate your candidate see I'm Glad that you're the guy and I think that when you get to do to the house of representatives and again everybody listening watching in this district need to go and vote or when you get there I think we're going to carry the torch very well for this district\nWell Joe thank you for that I think what you do and your listeners please do get French show up to vote let's make sure we send a strong message was not just went by little that's run by a lot and not get busy in Washington doing is that we would do and make this country great again\nDied a chip we appreciate it we're back after this and the Joe ... thanks\nMake this country great again died or ... we appreciate it we're back after this and the Joe packed shows the writer thing to go\n[noise]\nKills me in a\nFamous ...
