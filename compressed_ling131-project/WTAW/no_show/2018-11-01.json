Amazon company\nAre carried give us that story the president now saying I might actually said more people to the border than I thought it was going\nFrom Reuters US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United states could thin as many at Fifteen thousand troops to the border with Mexico and behind the stance against the caravan of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America\nAs far as the caravan is concerned our military is out will go up to anywhere between ten and Fifteen thousand military personnel on top of border patrol ice and everybody else at the border Trump told reporters that the White House\nAnd the Trump Administration on Monday but the number of troops in aimed to send to the border and over fifty two hundred\nCampus not to use integration as an issue to motivate Republican voters ahead to November ... elections next week or Republicans all thinking maintain control on those congressional chambers and the presidential candidate before the last election and two thousand sixteen\nTrump promised to harden immigration laws and build a wall along the southern border with Mexico but implementation and the signature campaign promise has been slow\nI care than Central American migrants estimated to number at least thirty five hundred people left Honduras in October and is now in southern Mexico I had to wait to the U.S border\nDid you want to tell people what you would you wrote me on the Facebook [laughter] nice little joke 'cause listen people have to understand that you are not as nice as you pretend on the radio on the dance and\nThat too I Am I just think that gave me a hard time every once in awhile\nHey let's talk more about the fourteenth amendment please pretty pleased that from Kerry while Haiti veterinary lock useless and then for you and your response there is no some of the Oreo\nWhen you tell me and my response was that's not nice don't believe me [laughter]\nYou're it's fine to a shot at\nYou know it might have been well it may have ... yeah I got it because I wasn't in a recall you would imagine story they give you a room and it\nIt All right so so there you go ah the president might be sending a whole lot more troops there and and again we should have a show of force on the border we should let people know who are who are want to be invaders\nThat we're not going to just stand by allowed to happen no matter how solved the left wants to be the border to be no matter how you know are they more compassionate we have to accept them they need a\nI saw somebody say that today on one of the week so I saved out and my answer was how many of these people are you going to walk into your home how many\nBecause listen there are people in need in this country we should take care of her own first but here's a quick question was a guy at the corner where I'd turn left to go to my gym every day\nAnd the guy standing there he's holding the sign\nUm help whatever you can do that I got the list of issues why he has to stay on the corner instead of going to the McDonald's across the street and asked to to get a job at minimum wage and start building himself back up he looks able bodied he's standing there all the time he walked back and forth a ... hour once a money\nManager let me ask you one of these liberals these bleeding heart to say we're not compassionate of will accept everybody who's breaking through the border\nWill you take that guy from the quarter better question if that guy comes to your house pushes his way into the door\nGrabs some food out of your refrigerator makes themselves from coffee and puts on his favorite TV show is he sits on your couch are you going to say well I have to do it I have more than he does I'm compassionate he deserves my stuff I have too much stuff and he has no stuff and he just wants a better life\nI'm guessing nobody on either side another right so I wouldn't say that's okay but even those intellect wouldn't say that's OK\nWhen you see far left is like Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook building a six foot wall around who's estate in Hawaii it makes you say to yourself or other they worked for a wall but they were they weren't for enforcement of the border\nWhen you see people living in in gated communities which is fine build a wall and blaming the gated community just there'll be a hypocrite when you talk about you know what it is that's going on\nYou know when you see the Obamas with their six or eight million dollar house in the DC area that's surrounded by you know security and they've got you know Secret Service all the time they're not accepting any of these caravan people\nAccepting the homeless people in in Washington DC to come and take their stuff because they have too much\nWhy did they compassionate not compassionate\nWhy not why not just allow them to have your stuff\nIf you're a liberal and you're a bleeding heart and usually open borders and we stole half of Mexico like Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke says\nTell everybody in the caravan to come and stay with you I saw this I mean the other to carry that if I was actually pretty appropriate mhm it was I think it was an open letter to to those in the caravan there are plenty of people in the United states would like to help you you can find them by looking for the ... science in the front\nYard how would they be over at when\nYou're stuck on the door I see the bait them like this I Do [laughter] I think that would\nBe all areas because they're oval of crap is what they are they're all of it and they don't want this in their house they just want to say as a society we should have or you got to put them\nPut them in your guest room I'd area it's eight eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com I'm going to be ... Michelle from campus reformed at old when we come back on Halloween and PC keep it right here you're listening to kill Paul [noise]\nThe school actually admit that it doesn't have the power to go after students and to penalize them if they wear a costume that the school deans racist so it's pretty ridiculous at the school pose in these things as serious imposes them as these rules that must be followed\nWhen they even admit they admitted to campus reform we're not going to go after students who break the rules\nSo they admit that it's ridiculous and that it can't be enforced because it's not doing anything wrong frankly\nI'm so it's it just shows how the left is basically creating problems so that they can be that wants to offer the solutions\nThat they're trying to ... you to not be the Mexican taco which they should uh I'm In San Antonio Texas should be ... percent Hispanic\nMainly Mexican ... at a toast talk much you know if I went on the radio or television showed tacos you're not Mexican I Would be in trouble you realize oh ... accused them or it's your job and won't be she'll give if you're going to ... to do much talked about would produce doing at Michigan State\n... what is Princeton doing\nPrinceton has actually released from the student government a checklist for a safe and inclusive Halloween and some of the questions that asks\nOn there are pretty ridiculous an obvious things uh one of them talked about how if you're wearing a costume that makes a joke out of a cultural group then you are racist and you\nShouldn't be wearing costume and it's actually unsafe unsafe by the school and I don't think it's so much the fact that they're saying hey be careful what you're wearing be careful not to wear this costs down I guess the fact that they're actually releasing a checklist\nSo these are Princeton students we can assume that they're pretty smart students generally I'm a young\nWell you badly well good of a job for a long term Princeton is going down a few runs in my mind that the day\nI mean it's an Ivy League school so it can at least assume that there is some degree of tell us more in these students we should at least be able to assume that there is something there and yet the school is coming out with these checklist telling students\nHey make sure that you do X Y Z before anywhere\nHollowing costume which in general is supposed to be something that's fun and lighthearted joke itself so I think they're turning things way too serious way too easily and it's pretty unfortunate to see because Halloween is fun it's a fun holiday students should be allowed these students and you know frankly the schools are not giving them the liberty to do that\nIt's been on these shows do you teach at you and then I understand that ... will will typically so that ... D\nEveryday like I Do ... ... or ... or ... your ... and ... and ... they had to Willie ... at the Democratic get into Princeton and then the the the the administration the faculty member at French didn't shed usual stupid are to tell you not to do that structurally would reach out and so\nYeah I mean essentially the school is saying hey I Know you worked super hard to get here I Know you did well on your SAT's you wrote a really impressive admissions essay but just so you know we don't trust you to wear inappropriate Halloween costumes\n[laughter] it's I think it\nAs an adult you should be able to make those decisions yourself and if you choose to wear something stupid you will you know you'll be the one to bear the brunt of those social repercussions yeah I don't think it's the school's job to be police\nThink that and ultimately schools are there to educate students they're there to teach them skills for the workforce I think policing what's going on on Halloween outside of the classroom is really just not what they should be in the business of doing\nCould not agree with you move to give them that you did we did what I Do which I Am on the show we went from Michigan to ah to New Jersey now to ... um what what is the University of Utah do we use it is different than what we've heard so far\nSlightly but it really fits into the same larger pattern\nHere at the University of Utah held his\nEvent called my culture is not your costs down which is fair enough but I Would think most students could be able to tell the difference between a culture and the cost and when I don't think it's that crazy but distinction\nTo know already or to try to make so the ah the school is holding these events and actually as a follow up to the event it released a new term which is different from cultural appropriation which is the one that we always hear like we've heard it a million times at this point\nThey actually cleaned the new term which is cultural co optician\nOcean which essentially seems to me the same thing to do that to keep Iran they keep reinventing the PC will where they're saying\nCultural cooperation is when you take something from another culture and you only take that one thing without taking the whole context\nSo the example that they use is a girl who dresses as an Indian for Halloween because she thinks that look cool do they call that cultural ... station so story time for you when I was a kid I dressed up as sacrifice for Halloween so I Know I Would be in big trouble if I did that now but\nAs a kid she's an American hero she ... Lewis and Clark\nOr when they were on the trail she help them with navigation finding food she help them stay alive and I'm from Oregon or\nState may not exist if it weren't for her so she's she's still the hero where I'm from all my friends loved it and my teachers loved it if I were that same costume for the same reason on the college campus today I Would be you were by the left for cultural collapse station or whatever it is they're calling it now and it's pretty fortunate see because they do think there are people that Jenny\nOnly want to honor other cultures\nBut they're not allowed to do that without being called a racist or without someone screaming cultural appropriation so pretty fortunate the scene because it gets to a point where you are being put into a box and you cannot take things from other cultures outside of your own merits and that that\nYou interesting to me that the way the\nAnd outside of your own ... I Wonder where\nWould you interesting to me is that the way that it was worded was this cultural ... not that that's really a word but it is that\nIf you don't do it in context so what does that mean if I decided I'm going to be whatever chief you know shooting born or whatever for Halloween do I have to have\nReal a Native American or American indian family members around me been itching contracts that I can get away with it what what did you do you even know what that means that it has to be context out how do you put it in context being struck a joy\nWhat's funny is they don't get very much contact or claiming that you need to have contacts so I can only assume Joe that they would expect you to bulldoze your house and put up a TV and I wanted to be sitting bull or\nYou know if I wanted to be back the way I Would have to walk to work every day instead of driving my car um I I don't really understand why they want to do that well yeah\nBut it's it's really do I'm Glad that you that you have a hard time explaining it'd just unexplainable would they\n... what what happens on the left is they put as many words will be possibly get in there and Obama was really good at that he will be asked a question at a at a town hall or the press coverage and it would give us twenty seven hundred words a dissertation as a nature and if you broke it down he really said nothing but many shuttle words I think the through the trying to get away with your age are Emily shell she's program director over at\nCuba's ripple into or go to websites give you about a minute if you don't mind him on on on Capitol Hill it's going out\nAnd asking people on college campuses\nUh about the caravan what your thoughts are on the care of him\nThat the leadership and get campus or for part of what we do is we spend our sneakers to college campuses and gauge with students and we send them out making videos engage with a student opinion is on current issues and\nIt's impossible to ignore one of the biggest issue as recently as the care of and that the opt out and that's coming up through Mexico right now to walk on Mexico\nAnd it's pretty interesting to see what students think about that because\nThey say there was one girl that said yeah I think we should let them all in and he said OK well\nIs there anyone we shouldn't let in and she goes oh I don't know maybe Nazis and he's like okay well how how would we determined that she goes well I don't know maybe it's just a risk that will have to take a while I think I think students really don't understand also who's in charge of immigration\nA Congress is in charge of you know immigration policy that it's not something that Donald Trump should really be blamed for and they they really keep going after the executive branch here they they have all these issues with ice\nIce doesn't make the rules their job is just to enforce them right it would be like going after your local police for enforcing the laws that your local legislators have put into place so so I think it's pretty it's thank you I think it's pretty ridiculous to the college students\nUm blaming one person or one administration for these problems that have been written for so long in Congress this is a solution that Congress needs to come up with and I think it's really disappointing to see that college students really there's just a lack of understanding\nAnd it really it's really an professors to be honest with you because they purposely or either filling their heads with us indoctrinated crab or they're not teaching them you know truly what's going on they don't seem to even understand ship it to our government works it's weird\nIt's very true there's a lot of students that never actually have to take an American history course we covered awhile back George, Washington university for history major is no longer required American history for those students who are majoring in history though it's pretty dismayed to see I think it's really important\nOr nothing I can and just a good citizen to understand the way our country works so that when you are dissatisfied with their government you know the best course of action to take and I think that most Republicans are pretty well informed on whereas most Democrats or not and it it's upsetting because\nWe see any Democrat students in these really liberal laughed at students they when they don't think they kind of tend to protest I have have a mob\nWhereas you know the more conservative things libertarians didn't they just go to vote so I think we're going to see that a lot in midterms coming up here and just about a week um we're going to see what the turnout is there and we're going to see what ends up happening but\nI think it really just comes down to what do you do when you're satisfied and things like conservatives really seem to have their head screwed on straight or about that\nThe absolutely right it's a enemy show are going to fall over at ... am a underscore M.

F. T. O. in South Florida so cool lots going on this week\nI think that for all of the amendments so if it's poorly written fix it\nAnd it is poorly written they should not have left out the part that said obviously this does not include are deemed otherwise obviously this doesn't include foreign dignitaries this doesn't include um the children of illegal aliens they should have said\nThat had they said that\nThere wouldn't be an argument now what do I want I don't want there to be birthright citizenship\nI don't I Want birthright citizenship to not apply to people who are coming here illegally there should be a change to this amend the constitution change the fourteenth do a a a convention of the states where you have to do there are proper processed cheese in place to fix where they screwed up\nIt's that simple\nSo I Believe will human I agree I Believe that most of us agree that I don't like the fact that somebody can break the law come here to drop a kid and the kid is a U.S citizen\nThat should be fixed and changed\nIt's interesting because on friday I Will have um oh have representative Ted Poe who's a former judge and he sees where I'm coming from and actually agrees\nSheriff Clarke however disagrees William disagreed although when you take all of it away carry the one thing that is constant here\nIs that those of us who are having a discussion or a smart enough to have the discussion and B we truly agree that we don't want the children of illegal aliens to get citizenship because they were born here\nWe all agree on that\nThey're just mad at me because I won't agree with their take on it and this talk show host said that this legal scholars show the other there's nothing that is hard to understand about what I just said the words are the words I read them they make sense to me they're English we should fix it\nNow I Will take your phone calls but now now you know what my stance is we've probably agree on what we want the game to be\nWe just disagree on what the current wording of this constitutional amendment says we go to the phone lines and again if you wanna light up over how I react to William you more than welcome to what am I going to I'm going to have you on the phone very long I'm at the show is it about you know the\nLet's play the talk show host sucks and they want to go do that today oh let me go to Joe in Kansas City Joe what's going on high\nAge out taking my call you got to be in\nThe I don't wanna like yeah but I Will say I think you're rude but I like that the argument let's go earlier I'm a lawyer and city okay so I Know that that you don't interpret law and you're getting your and you're not you\nKnow I Want to stop you because they will you made the mistake of saying that to bottle away William got angry uh William was snappy William took six minutes but if you think that was rude I can appreciate that you feel that way having set it\nI didn't say we don't interpret laws of course we do I said ... amendment shouldn't be interpreted no I Know that you can make the argument that an amendment is the law but I'm telling you is the enemy is not a law it's a directive to the government as to what they can do to us\nAs far as taking our rights away so I think there's a bit of a difference there if we're going to believe is conservatives that this is the foundation that's etched in stone to me it's not open to interpretation but go ahead I'm listening\nWell that's what the courts do they interpret laws right within ... okay so it is that price reputation and and the fact that you said that long ago that you think it's for the written it would agree that it is that it's not clear\nNo no no no I don't think it's a big us at all I think that it says exactly what it says my problem is that the senator at the time Howard said exactly the way it should have been written this does not include dignitaries their children their families or\nAliens he actually said it it's written all over the place he never put it in the actual amendment I don't think that this is\nThis is an enigmatic at all I think this is very direct it says what it says and that's why I've got a problem with it that's why\nThe interpretation which is what liberals do they interpret something that's written in stone and again I agree with you about laws again constitutional amendments are laws in my opinion\nThere are an adult printed rights of the American people that can't be infringed upon or taken away by the government why we think we can screw around with him is strange to me there is an amendment process by which we can change things having said that it says what it says I don't think it's in the U.S at all to you you're a lawyer you read you read this doesn't it say what it says\nOr things today that your original person and I don't know where he's well personally I don't like to like ... and ... and they give us it's not clear and the reason why it's not clear is because there were terrorists fiction doesn't necessarily mean exactly as you are kind of characterizing it yesterday as meaning like somebody's already or a studio\nThere under your jurisdiction that's not exactly how or does it mean then well actually in the example you just gave us perfect they said that all here that are here illegally are not undercut the jurisdiction there not right right right and so the children are often outside of the\nJury I disagree because once the child is that it's a different individual that person is in fact because the person broke the law to get here they're not falling or laws they're not under the jurisdiction that person should be sent back but if they drop a kid in the meantime what are the kid do\nThe kid is now if the kid is now in the journal under the jurisdiction look if the if the the mother had the baby the baby was in dire need what'd you give the\nBaby care\nLike yeah well why why it's on in your jurisdiction send them back to Mexico send it back to ... care you know against the woman why and\nI I I understand that I'm asking you about the child because the woman clearly broke the law the child didn't do anything wrong the child had been born here and the fourteenth amendment says you're now under our jurisdiction\nAnd therefore you're a citizen I don't know how that's in big us now the fact that you and I disagree doesn't make something ambiguous that's not the definition of ambiguous ambiguous means it's not showing the the the defined meaning that was intended\nSo ... is that the fact that you and I see it differently I think you're smart I think you can read those words as well as I can and I actually think you agree with my interpretation but you don't want to I think that you want it to mean something different\nLook door jurists down is used all the time by police agencies I Can't do that I don't have jurisdiction this is the FBI's jurisdiction it runs it it it's a matter of\nA community in which the laws should be followed and whether you have to follow them clearly the illegal alien didn't follow the laws they're not under our jurisdiction go back to where you came from oh you had a kid he hasn't done anything wrong with the kid is\nThey're not under our jurisdiction go back to where you came from oh you had a kid he hasn't done anything wrong with the kid is in our jurisdiction therefore this unfortunately by its wording says that's a citizen I Want it to be changed joined thank you and I agree you really think that there shouldn't be changed\nOr actually here's what I Would say is is you know it's I'm not a judge and you're not a judge and ultimately adjustable determine this I think that wet\nSpring others with this court's going to I think you're right\nRight and actually I think that's what President Trump is doing because realistically the only person that's going to be able to get this in front of a court would be President Trump and the reason is is because nobody has standing\nWell how do I get a little older than I Want to stop you because as a lawyer what you just citizen correct\nThe president doesn't have standing the president can't sue to get the fourteenth amendment change I mean you don't you're right you're right I mean he can't\nI mean he can do with Obama did but then again we'd be saying let's let let's like Trump do what we hated a liberal president doing Obama with his ... his phone went around Congress went around the the constitution constantly change laws all the time and you and I both\nStood on the highest mountain and screamed and yelled about it but now we want this guy to do it I look I think President Trump doing a great job out of the game to do anything ... executive order now he can try and then maybe he'll be sued by the stage and then maybe you just before the Supreme Court or best what you meant ... in a roundabout way that\n... that's exactly correct because the fact that is right now nobody would have standing the question the law as it's currently interpret it\nYou know I disagree I disagree with you I tell you why I think the California New Mexico Arizona and Texas do have standing because we and I'm In Texas we are are encouraging those major medical fees\nI mean nobody's nobody's going to a hospital in Laredo having a baby and paying the bill they're not paying the bill so clearly there is somebody harm to you you agree to that\nWell I Would however that Pakistan is so much more difficult to get to go get it getting to court and so what's much more easy is that she denies the right to a newborn a of a legal immigrant that newborn would directly have standing the question the law and then it's going to force the interpretation of the court\nAlthough I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you that if it gets to the Ninth Circuit court of appeals are going to be as clear as I can with you and I think you sound smart I think you're going to agree with me if it gets to the Ninth Circuit court of appeals and if it doesn't get to the Supreme Court which still may\nThe Ninth Circuit court is going to say you don't have standing to bring this case they're not going to put anything they're not gonna ruin even just going to throw it out and say he doesn't have standing you know that happens all the time\nWell it would be that child that would bring into the child would have standing and so the child and the New Orleans is who's going to bring this case right now nobody can bring this case because I Can't bring it to say either you know somebody only legally\nYou bring your case I mean it's probably be ... it'd be executive order that's exactly\nUCLA you would do a little like we're doing multiple do or you know everybody would line of\nIt right right and and it would be thrown out because he doesn't have standing that is what I'm saying I don't know who wouldn't have any\nOther president for having made the move for having made that they're going to bring the law suit against what he did and the court is going to say he had no right to do it you're correct what you're saying that these groups won't have standing\nNo no no no that's how I was standing there standing at the right to bring a suit\nAnd so right now nobody would have standing for the question is law if Trump than shoulder the interpretation which he has the right to executive branch is executed of these laws and he can direct agencies to not continue to allow citizenship a new or any legal immigrants so like\nMine on sunshine ...

British a philanthropic arm the ... they should have said I Am convinced the devil lives at our phones is wreaking havoc on our children\nFrom the time we were children we were told\nThat we're not supposed to sit that close to the television dose across the TV it'll blind you will it's now in the palm of your hands and the kids are mesmerized by what can be seen as a dangerous oracle that somehow has tremendous power over our children I mean we the people are now and cultural trends\nWe're being sent messages that are triggering our tendency to be angry and violent and so this demonic spirit is being poured into the zeitgeist which is being fed not only by social media [noise]\nWhy the increasing dark programming being unloaded into the pop culture [noise]\nTripoli six every three thirty seven hundred that's AAA thinks every three thirty seven hundred [noise] I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\n\n\nQuandary it's like gas sliding\nIt's almost as if you know the government or some organized group some organized\nCult or ... ball he's gas sliding you\nAnd so you started seeing things you start realizing\nI wait a minute I don't\nI don't normally think this way why am I thinking this way you second guess yourself many people they second guess themselves without having colonel experiences\nAnd then you find yourself confused because you're always told this is the way I was always taught in Sunday school or school how things are but then you realize that the world as many layers it's like an onion and very deep within the subconscious or the phobias that shape your belief system they motivate you and most people\nForm opinions and habits based on their hidden phobias based on the miss they were raised with based on religion they were I mean many people find refuge\nEither refusal to commit to a belief system however there are moments where strange advanced can now get the staunch non believer and again the confusion begins a supernatural scares\nAre out there and that's why we haven't Halloween we have ... we have shadowy monsters we ... we we we listed in the news reports\nAnd and they scare us who have murderers we got national disaster that natural disasters we we we narrowed down all the scares me with all the way the fat and\nFind ourselves that we are stuck in this well\nAnd the well is the ... of the money and we conclude\nThat there has to be evil\nKnievel has to exist\nSomething the reminds if there is a cold and non forgiving spirit\nThat can manifest in the flesh\nOur thoughts betray us and the fears we have that rule us\nAre manifesting now and we see that we're living in times\nWhere the bail it seems to be lifting and every person\nEvery other person every person some people those you look at our manifesting as children were black eyes there manifesting as shadow people their manifesting is am I obese men in black cryptic\nCreatures of the night like the ... the mosque man we have all of these things going through our minds as we as we can think about some of the most\nGod awful creatures from the best every vampire everywhere will becomes a tangible and frightening reality\nAnd beginning to see that every real evil\nIs somehow intertwined with us now\nI've seen the change in attitudes of most people\nI mean we have a handful of outcome is looking to heaven saying there'll be an intervention there'll be some some weight will have an intervention Jesus will come I mean there are many more\nSo than say don't forget though we have to\nWe have to wait for that the truth to them about the anti Christ or about some pasta see 'em you look in the sky\nAnd you're wondering what is out there they just capture in some sort of UFO flying over the moon the other night of the Hubble Space telescope oh no the Kepler telescope is now dead it's it's it's not working anymore so it's out of fuel just out there floating something shut it down there was an anomaly the shutdown a rocket and China\nAnd there are theories out of our planet X. they space platforms coming from the sun being shaped like a queue huge things coming out of\nThe Christian world is looking at these ideas as proof that\nThese are signs science from the sky their significant\nPortland's leading to the end of the world were being worn\nThat there are wormholes reporters that can be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider to send those real entities can pass through\nAnd they can hunt mankind and change the direction of the future\nWhenever I hear of someone trying to open up a port or trying to open up the heavens or at least ripple holding space time I look back at a cult is like Alister cruelly magicians and Kelly and John D and how they use special keys to open the heavens and communicate with beans from the sky\nI've talked about rituals like the Bible on working carried out by rocket scientist jak Parsons Ron Hubbard is is ritual that allegedly opened up a vortex in Mexico desert in something team through\nSomething profane\nLike a monkey with this shape plus form the silk form that came through and many believe that is your example of a demonic entity that similar features like the aliens too\nSo you objective of all these all comers which to find a doorway to heaven or hell depending on the perspective of this story and so you know I've been thinking about this a lot\nThis Halloween and that there were so many things I wanted to talk about that you know we we can just kind of you know open our\nConversation to this because it just seems to me that this Halloween\nThere seems to be this real\nFeeling of darkness this dark wave or perhaps entities that have come into this world that don't belong in this world imagine how the possibility can be abused the idea that they can say we have the power over such entities\nAnd that was created need for a world entity to combat the man is something that would lead to something that would show us the way something that would bring peace\nRemember Ronald Reagan so they had to be an alien\nIf there was an alien threat from outside this world we would all come together but maybe it doesn't happen to be an alien threat I mean the ... when you look at the essence of powers of the world\nThey're using technology now\nThey're using their machinery and a cult rituals to build a better anti Christ presence on the planet and ensure that the people\nWill follow\nAnd they will do so blindly and fully because they fear that there are demons in the world they fear that they have protectors they will protect them from these demons the intelligence corps have kept secrets regarding a possible demonic presidents\nThey protect us from a possible alien presidents and so no one knows exactly when and how to implement or to explain\nThis reality for their own purposes I tried to explain it to you but it may sound a little crazy it may sound a little off but you know we receive information telling us that the time barrier has been conquered and the dimensions are revealing that there are more things in heaven and earth it can be dreamt of in any philosophy\nOr any dimension for that matter\nThe future\nErnie mentioned for that matter\nWe'll be forged\nWith new revelation\nThe future will be forged with wonder in a war of what should or should not be\nGoing on fighting against\nThe spiritual unnamed on team demonic powers and it's up to us to figure out when to fight it's up to us to pick our battles and like I said before you know there are many\nTechnologist now that are worried about our technology you know some of them this is how they make their money and they say well we need to be aware that our innovations especially children you know they have\nThe screening the palm of their hand um and like I said it was I figured that the ... who worked\nAs an executive um\nRoaches executive with the Mark Zuckerberg Jordan marks liquor bird to the executive assistant to Facebook with mark ... initiative and she said I Am convinced\nThat the devil lives in our phones and its wreaking havoc on our children now why would you say something like that so I mean that's the scary part\nIs that this demonic spirit is being poured into guys being fed\nThrough the algorithms the wires and the and the and the platforms and it's getting out there are a lot quicker it's a viral viral philosophy that gets to be in in sinking ended up bring [noise] for bullied six seven three thirty seven hundred this ... three thirty seven
