it's the exact me what the Aggies needed at this point maybe now they'll understand how good they are ah yeah and that's what Jim was talking about at practice yesterday when are we heard him say it's a it's about us if not about the opponent\nAnd or we're going to find out a lot about our team yeah tomorrow well I think we found out a lot about our team that we did and\nParticularly the defense they were just awesome tonight\nDefense was terrific again as we mentioned that the leading Russia and the SEC is Benny ... junior and averaging one hundred thirty three yards per game Thirteen carries sixty yards for him his longest run was eleven yards in this game he averages almost six yards carrying it\nFour and a half a pregame although I Will say this I was a little surprised I thought Kentucky got a little ... now I understand wanting to put a defense off balance they hit their tight end C. J. Conrad for a couple of passes\nBut I thought they kind of went away from ... junior I said during the game are they getting a little too cute with what they're doing on all things and not and not going to their strike maybe they knew a little something that does a in a defense is going to who's going to tighten up that I I\nI don't know what they were thinking but I was also a little bit surprised that he only had Thirteen Gary's I was surprised that a lot more carry to uh when he's the believing ... you know and that's\nGot to be the fewest carry these had this year well\nIt it it is you know why he only at Fifteen against Murray state but he had to yeah twenty and the first game but twenty seven against Florida twenty five against Mississippi State and he had twenty eight last week against South Carolina you cut that half yeah against day in and I don't get it\nAnd it's not like Terry Wilson was running wild like like you had other success or you don't have to do that so but again\nI guess it's hey if they're not going to run how else can we tell a house can we try to\n... well I respect for that or a and M. B. fence they needed to do something different than what they were doing because many smell junior was not getting the yards that they're used to him having\nYeah not just the six acts but to more tackles for waltz a total of eight tackles for loss by the defense and we'll Johnson would talk with Donald in Wilson one of three Victoria's Aggies after this one he let everybody with twelve tackles and I'll tell ya I dunno the open field tackles nowhere as many snow junior of more dangerous than when he breaks\nThat first tackle because that short gain becomes a big gain Donald does that make those tackles Kentucky's all fences a different story Well Donald tonight was the safety\nBut I've always thought he was going to be\n... bills open field tackles were phenomenal and ... and ... we rally I mean I said from the beginning this defense has to get to the ball they have to chase the ball Baptist around it because one guy can't bring them down I was wrong when Donovan we also got there\nHe was he was centering them up and taken under the ground he was good the night\nHe had four solo tackles a tackles a ... for solo tackles Kingsley Kiki had for solo tackles three by daily Mac

just an ... starting to get us back\nTo well back to pass pressure\n\n[noise] oh they kept getting the Wilson kept getting the Wilson\nMaybe the biggest one was the one in overtime though because it's a make real goal range right I agree so you push you push Kentucky back ends up being a forty three yards vehicle they're pushing back to the twenty five yard line up all got to be data to thirty three forty three yard which is just beyond the edge\nOf the kicker is field goal range\nAbout this far without that far across yeah Kiki told us in the pregame show what's it like what the feeling when you get\nThe sack and it's like going up the habit right well heaven sent was this attack by Kingsley Kiki overtime\nNow we'll see we'll see\nThat\nIt was huge it was it it it's it's one of the differences you look at little plays that's one of\nThem well that's why I call the huge because it made them kick a long field goal and instead of the shorter one and all they knew there was another foot and it would have clear them knowing the uh the the goalposts instead the cross bar across and that's what I was making\nHis the cross bar Titus fourteen Aggies in their possession speaking up their possession Trayvon Williams twenty three of the twenty five yards kill among other first down um\nWomen who yard run that I read I read beyond was a man\nIn overtime and it was good to see because we'll kept talking about\nThe ... you know gene Sutherland had gone off and then Conor Lamb fear at at right guard and then Ryan McCollum comes in but there is that pride in that all sense of line\nFor a and M. and they really really set that tone on that possession that they set the tone and then ended this game because of how they push that Kentucky line back\nHard to do that is a good group that is right up there on throughout the year and you had to go in and the third\nReich guard on line yeah because it keeps on he was down there he was trying to go it didn't look too serious but whatever that next step he needed to take to be able to play do look good and get over the hump\nAnd then I think on our land here he left the sidelines after two series he was saying the ... and so\n... they were still able to get some push against an excellent the ... the front\nOne thing we mentioned but we didn't talk a lot about is on this Kentucky\nTeam how\nOld they are how experience are yeah they've got a whole bunch of seniors yeah we we mentioned Josh Allen who came back ah to for his senior season when he could have gone to the NFL but there are a whole bunch more uh their senior\nLaid various west interception symbol recovery El Nino Loni Johnson cornerback senior Mike Edwards\nWho made a ton of play at least seven for them senior Derek Beatty on the other side senior as well as a Josh ... saying we prizes that and that's why they were going to be a Josh ... all over the field I get a chance to watch forty one Kentucky watch him yep but a big penalty\nBy Josh Allen hitting Cal in mind wage allowed the Aggies to have better feel position remember there was a there was a false start moved to the second and gold at the age they got closer but then it was the automatic first down on the receiving the quarterback and that allowed the touchdown throw\nTo court and David that really hurt Kentucky surprised you came from Josh Allen but he was he was he was hugging the quarterback as he's known all along but the egg is able to take advantage of that yes I get to and get that huge touchdowns touchdowns are hard to come by tonight\nWill Johns who was able to catch up with Jim both Fisher after this victory\nCoach I think the first thing to say is man will football game\nWas we can find a way to make it interesting but then one day when\nThe fighting a determination and the way those kids played in their minds are getting better we were still leaving so much out there but our defund was outstanding our special teams way we kick the ball we miss them feel go but I'm Talking about the hunting kick off the courage\nTo put returns setting up score setting up field position was outstanding and we're getting better man off as we're moving in football we've gotta finish drives Web ... and\n... and it's not the same guy is a high that it's a ... market to miss one map where the ball's gonna or somebody jump off side I mean just put your money\nIt's a myth blockage in ... or somebody jump off side you know I mean just put you behind the chain and we gotta quit that\nYou mentioned the defense they were terrific and I wanted to ask about Donovan Wilson and the game and he played I mean he was everywhere it seems\nThat the aim of day what do I practiced as an exact way practice and those ... those guys up front may know the whole group anger the way they covered the way they play when they were outstanding\nTray beyond that's about the hardest yards he's probably gotten in his career\nAnd say what he learned to be a workhorse for me what he ended up with a hundred and forty four and twenty four cares I mean he was told that thing and running and that last job he wasn't getting denied ... like\nThe ability of of this team to come back from a devastating fumbled ... that says a law\nDon't need that they need a character to do it the big ... I mean that's the thing we play the next play and they bought into doing those things I Wish you wouldn't have to do\nThat [laughter] finally this uh you talk to them in the locker room after the Arkansas game you know you got to be able to play with pressure in a big time game maybe when you're the favorite 'cause you praise the way they play against ... and mental mammals underdog but they played with pressure tonight\nThey did and they're learning how to do we got to get better at it but there were getting better expecting to win knowing when ... because if you go prepare then it's not pressure and they're learning how to practice practice practice is paying off\nAnd I do congratulations thank you very much anybody else noticed our partner Dave smile ... about the practice but that was one of the first things you noticed this season was the way the team's practicing\n... and ... he there's so much coaching going on at practice and it's different from past regimes every play Jim ... has something to say and I said this already tonight probably a couple of times he says it's quite often\nLittle things count and he mentioned it again they're little things like like that five yard penalty than what you buy in the sticks little things like my some of them are big things like the foam balls and the interceptions and those types of things\nYou play a mistake free football you're going to win a lot of games particularly when you're out it's like to say an empty ... yeah I mean the future for this team is phenomenal if they could just all lemonade the mistakes dark causing the other team to make mistakes\nAnd ah they're they're going to win a lot of games if they can do that consistently\nWho was the one who told us before this game mindset it was well Johnson and the mindset of this team will change from week to week wall that they now they know that they can now they know they can win in that style\nIt it's like every game\nIt's like a staircase every game is another step and jumbos process I thought the night it was playing with pressure after that fumble mean\nHow many teams just\nYeah they want to win after that but how many people just can't after after a formal like they'll be bold and you're just frozen in the late in the game and all it takes is one more school for the other team to me too but\nI thought they played with pressure really well I Do want to play this uh in the locker room jumbo Fisher cold outbreak man and what he is doing right now you know absolutely incredible and I ... and we started at night by bridging the gap and I'm going to\nBreak man is an unsung hero of this team right now Nineteen Ninety eight they weren't a lot of games and shame liquid yeah ... yeah I Am helping them where they where the idea uniforms but Ninety eight team was watching and I had to do this overtime victory over the wild guess\nThat it was said yes it was [laughter] at our case day it's one of them could donkeys and the other one romantic man\nBut I Do a lot of guys point because my Kentucky scores you're thinking well\nKentucky's just achieved there just ... they're going to make all the brakes on it already made it look like their time but then we're red then when when you get the choice in your said we're putting our defense on you made the statement to Kentucky you can't score against us they had tried here in the air tried here jak links overtime\nAnd I think they still had some confidence after that devastating play because once you looked at each other on the sidelines you still could admit to yourself well they're not moving the ball on them yeah they still are not moving the ball on a slow you worked up some confidence prior to that and it helped to withstand that blow and Kentucky tied the game\n... down conversions she was Thirteen zero for their last night there were times or Kentucky got maybe a first down or two but then they got pushed back and the drive would end the part where say twelve drives\nOne touched down ten parts in a in a field goal attempt but it's it's the cross bar at six more threat out such Thirteen and the last two weeks brand up his father's defenses fun and he'd smile or about that too [laughter]\nThey all said both game show continues from ... in overtime plenty to fourteen or sucking telling bought Eighteen of twenty\nNine for two hundred and twenty six yards two touchdowns wonder Courtney Davis from three yards wanted Jay Stern burger from forty six yards are receiving\nA tray down Williams had six catches for Seventy two yards so he had over two hundred yards of total off it I like what they're doing with Trayvon Williams and some of those throws getting the ball in his hands raw like what\nThere'd be a way of some of those throws getting the ball in his hands\nRaw like what Trayvon Williams is doing once they put the ball has more to throw it to him these are\nLike I said earlier he he was he was a man and I yeah and particularly in overtime I ... I just love his desire he just he just will not be stopped I just love it\nSometimes it's hard to be I don't want to say overlooked and he's not one of those people who plays the disrespect card and it's funny because ... now has 'cause he wanted to go to Ohio State and try and go to Ohio State so he goes to Kentucky so that's his chip on the shoulder and whatever works\nBut it's so funny ... you know everybody's talking about number one in the conference number two is pretty good too and Trayvon Williams and as you've said they've just flipped him [laughter]\nYeah well yeah we don't know who won demise right and\nThe other thing was is Jim Will always talks about training on wants to be a complete back he showed that tonight it's not just the Russia's and the receptions how many times do we see him saying that backfield and block because Kentucky gets good pressure on her he wants to be a complete back and he's becoming a complete back\nThen it's the tackle breaker aspect to it and ... is running backs coach mentioned that in the summer and what he's got to do to be successful and the SEC is be attack will break or even looted tackles I mean he can make a cut and get away from you know you can run around you but\nThe physical tackle breaking part of it is now there too and I think he is a complete back now now that added dimension he is and I think\nThat's because he work\nIn the offseason any both up it got stronger he didn't lose any speed home he got himself ready to have this kind of season he's having mhm\nMore power to and that's great for him as great protects Becky football she was the first one I asked about the coaching change of being all that and and that was a bass drop for the twelve man foundation meetings the view athletic ambassadors\nShe was the guy and all the work with Jerry Schmidt strength coach right\nAnd he saw the difference in his body and he knew what's going to make me better for the SEC she's not he knew what he knew what it took\nNow what am I going to do to change to make to make it even something so in that and we've talked time and again about the leadership so if Jim both said gee you will about that's what I that's that's how Donald practices\nWe've talked about that Trayvon Williams he's setting the tone for the ... and everybody else on that often that leadership now coming through that's also\nPart of this foundation 'cause this is the way it's going to be from now on because these guys are ... jumbo set the tone but these guys are leading the way well jumbo can tell her Molly once it's the players that have to\nImplement it and\nIt's guys like pray beyond and matter of being gay and Kingsley geeky and\nDonahoe those guys Gillespie a cow in mind even as young as he is he's a he's still turning into a leader of those guys are the ones that have to take the lead and show 'em exactly what Jim both talking about\nNow and then remember Trayvon on the Kentucky film or turn the tide of tried to make a heck of a play and the touchdown saving tackle was her right when they all went back out there it's like he tore down the medical [laughter]\nBack out there and be with and yeah all that he says they listen but you see something like that a guy do that ... really listen to anything he's barking at from here on out\nJumped back on the field and then was the difference in the right time drawing just awesome okay up next this is the road sex you know it's funny\nI'm looking at this schedule a September had the glamour games now we go into the road portion and it begins 'cause we're not back here for another month games at an open date but South Carolina next week I\nDo we almost think the same thing a spouse it's about a and M. going into South Carolina thirty seven thirty five winter's over Missouri today\nTo into in the east which is starting to get a little bit tighter floor to beat cell issue um South Carolina with that when George is on a on beaten and at the top of that as D.C east but it's a big win for South Carolina they get to be at home for this for this a and M. team it's another it's another tested in other challenges and it's\nIt's a chance for the Aggies to go to\nA road game and\nIf they play well they will likely win the game if you use tonight's game as a yardstick because Kentucky twenty four and a ten over South Carolina what two weeks ago last week or last year yeah yeah last week so it's another\nOpportunity for the Aggies to grow as a football team and learn to play well on the road and hostile territory a go there and take care of

I think somebody put a crush on me and and I should Ari let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're ... you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they give you prove the job over and I went oh huh and I said\nA couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being the person who apologized and took the curse off permanently and everything's fine\nOr stop sending negative energy to hurry war off writing because I Am so\nMy question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is [noise]\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person\nBelieve you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to put somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\n... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens and but\nThe bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get at all\nNo you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nYou use every buddy susceptible to a curse what about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up the force field to kind of block it and she'll do\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were cursed\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact think about it ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's the game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there that had her gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap as he does\nGet an energy thrown on that person\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team has an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every others stadium that is not his home state yeah\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players will\nHer ballplayers in a slump let's say a damn\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too into specially ballplayers\nLook at the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums you know you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James that a basketball game you would never get on court the guards and everybody would keep you away\nYour but gee if your ghost who's going to stop you know money exactly\nWhat about the dream state ... visiting the dead and for other things\nOne person has crossed into the light they can absolutely come in and out of your dreams you can talk to them you can get all kinds of information from them you can get a hard\nA kid I mean it

and he was stopping in Chicago I said already gone to Chicago for he said I Do this once a year he said there are about ten of us were all pastors and we get together once a year\nAbout ten of us were all pastors and we get together once a year at a location and spend time several days with one another [noise]\nTalking about the issues that are going on in our church in our lives we just it's kind of accountability group for us and he said there's not really anybody in the town where I live where I can have that kind of transparent relationship\nIt's a small enough town that like you said what can the past if the pastor or shares his is real life issues he may get run out of town for that\nAnd I thought it was wise uh my friend to cordon off this time to spend the money on the plane ticket my hotel and go do this with other guys too many pastors are living in isolation aren't\nThey yeah and that's why it's not enough to say that past needs exams on her and say as familiar to change me\n... be culture changed take place in the local church let me just speak to that for the second temptation dangers the danger of a rifle\nIt's very easy\nWith a high level of theological understanding and biblical literacy of the average pastor was a huge amount of resources are available to me to think of myself as spiritually mature you can be\nTheologically knowledgeable biblical illiterate and have marked errors immaturity and your life it's easy to begin to think of myself as a grace graduate\nI've arrived I Know it all and that's an invalid place to look for your definition of maturity so what that does is you'd have the combination of my own assessments of arrival\nAnd the body of Christ putting me on a pedestal no wonder then I'm comfortable with living in isolation from the central St defined ministry of the body of Christ if Christ is the head of his body and he is here's what this means is real practical\nEverything else it just body [laughter] including the best part of the reason for remembering that is the deceitful and it's a sin\nSin blinds guess who are blind first I never had any tropes the incident my wife and children\nSo as long as they're sending me there'll be pockets of spiritual blindness I Would like to think that no one has a more accurate view as me than I Do but it's just not true\nAnd so I Need the intervention of the body of Christ as a pastor and I need help see myself with accuracy\nAnd you're never going to get that perspective of yourself and isolation nope you got to have people who are holding up the mirror of the scriptures to you and saying it's time to have a throne jak here\nThat's he Bruce three twelve and Thirteen exert when another daily that you'd be hard to see from was in my way of capturing that his

for you to coach a young pastor on marriage maintenance and coach I'm On what he does if the church doesn't share the priority that he thinks there ought to be for marriage made them so they're saying why are you taking time off to be with your wife we don't get to do that\nIf you examine the pastoral their souls there is no obvious or lengthy discussion between the undo those tensions between family and ministry none of that tension is assumed by us\nKnow when you say about this God will never call you to do one command that will necessitate you breaking another\nPerhaps that tension between family in ministry is set up because I'm wanting things out of ministry that I'm not supposed to get\nMy identity in success size of the church power and prominence was that will create is driven this I got to get more got to get more to do more never enough accomplishment 'cause those are fleeting identities\nIt's not that has called me to do things that I Can't do at the same time is

but for the eyes of the country this week ugly uncaring crash do come near to what transpired in the new phase of judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing it was an effort at a new sort of current the as soon as I argued over at the Washington Post this week\nThe Democrats will ultimately share the credit proceeding to ruin the lives of Brett Kavanaugh and his family they're likely is accuser Christine Blasey Ford Elite media outlets did their part in the facilities to the allegations the Washington Post and the New Yorker\nAnd then it was something of a free for all one qualified legal observer professor Alan Dershowitz retired now from Harvard law school a wife or liberal now moving somewhere near the center laid waved to the Democrats cynical miscarriage of this confirmation proceedings\nMy colleague Dennis Prager took a closer look\nLet me read to you from Harvard bill or\nLet me read to you from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz\nAnd his description of what is happening\nIf he is now denied the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible in prison and he may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully\nIf he could be forced to resign as current traditional position because having a coat convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these

country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nThe American civil liberties union steward strong against McCarthyism by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nBut we now live in an age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism we must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrat Harvard law professor darker than McCarthy is\nEven though if you read the report of Rachel Mitchell the woman who seems to have asked you

cover ... orchestrated by the Democrats were both crass cynical [noise]\nThey reached the very core of our country a country founded upon some judicial principles of due process stood the test of time [noise]\nFirst of all like the presumption of innocence for at risk here\nI turned to a strategic voice in the Senate that senator Joni Ernst of Iowa\nWhat have you been hearing well I Am hearing of course a mixture of that cause I get to the office a lot of them are are saying get Kavanaugh and firearms and then there are others that um are\nYou know adamantly opposed way the those thoughts on the TV all the time I'm by cab what I Do hear when I'm Out in about ... people just can't understand why we haven't moved on with at\nGetting him confirmed they understand that he has the right credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and ... that that we should get this done than\nI Want to review a few things with you about the testimony first of all there was a story in Politico that she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be delayed she never actually said that herself but that was represented the committee\nShe did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she's familiar with polygraph they had never discuss sexual assault\nThere they knew real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows that was nice\nNew real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows that was not about claustrophobia but a second entrance for an office there wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the Rachel Mitchell Report I simply do not believe that that testimony could knock\nBrett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I'd I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I Do honestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point so do I sure do I I I think most folks would agree with that however um even the witnesses that she called forward\nActually uh can't corroborate or simply tear down that that testimony that she gave without um some party that she had attended so unfortunately for her I don't\nFind that can be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think Shakespeare and trauma that I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was tied to Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught maybe attending the fourteen year old they will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people have not stood up\nTo a to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is that none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse was allegation was libel was slanderous and immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge cabin on your view\nWell I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um but we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put through um the\nWorst possible situation ever with their father being demeaned and an discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we have those discussions on why would anybody want to step\nUp be nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office if it simply takes an accusation and unproven accusations which can put a family literally through how\nJust look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance and as about what can we stop and put in the president's way what can we put in Congress his way to stop\nThem from doing a better job for the United states of America I mean look at our economy and how strong we are doing right now and and know thanks to our counterparts\nAcross the aisle they have tried to slow it down stop at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it as as stopping the tax cuts in JOBS Act what ever it is\nThey try and LA LA resist um and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that person\nIn America disheartening speckled with is taking place in the United states of it some very good news came out of mid week the new trade deal was filing son with Canada several

the Heritage Foundation will pick up their interview with more\nThe huge victory for Donald Trump I mean we've got a new NAFTA modernized now but by the way I I've always gotten out there was a pretty good thing I mean unified our North American continent or Canada Mexico and the United states and but\nIt needed to be modernized there were a lot of things in the ... were out of date and were unfair and you know Trump had a big victory here first got Mexico to sign on and then he's you know tighten the screws on Canada\nAnd they made some real concessions here Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make and now they're sets up very nicely poor negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst uh you know abusers of portrayed laws and on the planet\nOne other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump had his part Scott parts and one of the points you made\nHis he said look I Want to use these tariffs as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but what is it working because these countries are reducing their cherished\nEven a review of the congressional budget office\nSays it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and a university Chicago survey of ... Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI Do it you know and I told them I disagreed with them or not I think you know I actually helped draft NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republican Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this was the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement is now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer\nBut it is a new on North American free trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries or it has modernized because America has a better deal and uh so I ... I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this deal so what're you got me on that one that's not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan a show I'm gonna agree with you on that one\nSo on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for their candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just in just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we talked about this on your show before war and more of what Americans producers called intellectual property reproduce\nComputer software we've gotten some copyrights and and the technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some and certainly trying on and many other countries in the Asian countries they just steal or an electoral property and this new uh I'll call it the U.S a CNA has much better protections\nFor an American similar properties all countries are going to use all products they actually pay for them was under the entire interview with economist Stephen Moore on terminal review dot com killing a\nDoesn't matter if he's innocent or guilty shows Spartacus\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey had quite the resolute right just rent and we talk about it when the tunnel review return to the moment [noise]\nIt was shocking to me that the government would try to take away my freedom\nRoutes when he was my\nThat's jak Philips a masterpiece cake shop in Colorado who was sued for living out his religious beliefs [noise]\nAlliance defending freedom took his case all the way to the United States Supreme court which recently gave jak a big victory but apparently not win wasn't enough for the Colorado government because it is harassing him again yes you heard that right this time we are taking the fight to the government but we can't do this without your health\nRight now you're give them one hundred dollars will help jak an alliance defending freedom in this fight against the hostile governments call eight hundred six nine one eight nine six nine that's eight hundred six nine one eight nine six nine if we can happen to Jack it can happen to you or any of the values religious freedom\nAll eight hundred six nine one eight nine ... or click on the alliance defending freedom banner at town hall review dot com\nBest public leaders are wave makers able to combine smart policy ideas with a call to what makes America exceptional creating waves of popular support\nOn the Peterson dean of Pepperdine graduate school of public policy and for two decades we've prepared wave makers through the nation's most unique masters curriculum combining rigorous study of our founding principles\nWith the latest tools of policy analysis based at one of the country's leading Christian universities are graduates go onto a variety of careers from chiefs of staff on Capitol Hill to the foreign service and intelligence agencies to nonprofit leadership on issues ranging from education reform to homelessness\nAmerica needs citizen leaders and we prepare them like no one else find out why we say at Pepperdine school of public policy\nYou'll see your future differently from here\nVisit us online a public policy dot Pepperdine dot edu that's public policy dot Pepperdine dot edu [noise]\nA household hazardous waste is any home chemical that may pose a threat to human life more\nGround air or water quality jak labels with key words such as danger boys and toxic\nFlammable bring these items along with computers and electronics to the university services complex October twenty from seven AM until two pm for directions and more information pull the household hazardous waste hotline at nine eleven nine seven six five four three eight zero nine for long gone to ... age age W. dot com\nYou know one of Tom ... the world's worst boss but one of those jobs don't you know jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a\nGold hung on corporate America are African surrounds\nYou clearly said we want quality not quantity ...

tension headaches I addict\nA pain down there are kind of thing and what is causing all these pain what are we doing to ourselves that we shouldn't be doing a lot of it is posture all positions that we get in all day long which is like sitting at a desk\nLooking at a computer reaching too far for mouth\nSeen a lot so that they\nCan you help us with I mean do you set it down here and say\nShow me the position of your decks showing how you do these things yeah\nThat's one of the things we do sometimes when I'm people have had a problem for a long time\nAnd sometimes there's more than just posture all changes to fix sometimes they got the journal joint problems that are driving their spine which means the joint stones it's well and then that's\nOf the things that we did as a chiropractor as we help the joints moved better and so there's not enough they're not as much irritation on the nerves\nFrom between the vertebrae okay if I can you mentioned that and I never had any problems at all I can you comment and before that I have a stand up desk\nKnow you actually put your tummy and the whole\nWay okay you can buy okay um what else what\nOther treatments guy how the whole thing I didn't even think about what other treatments are we going to come before what other things can you help us fix well does your chiropractor\nUm a lot it varies from Harvard to your car or like a ... and something\nWe all kind of had a little niche we've got my\nShe too a lot of the pregnant ladies and she also in almost in a special tens in pediatric okay well I'm going to go how do

just using the pressure points around this fine can help relieve some of the pressure on the nerves that go to the stomach\nAnd wow ... ... and everything and wow\nOkay so if we have a campaign that cannot be explained or we don't know you really are the first stop rather than a lot of yeah\nI think it's we should be because you know you're\nNot medicine then we're not medicines\nAnything and I teach at that school and so\nI Know what they teach to medical\nBecause you're teaching law I'm not teaching them did\nRight now I'm teaching them about integrated medicine okay you know what is actually quite\nSure what his car oh and that reminds me of acupuncture I've always wanted to know about that but I've always been scared I think you got me as a client now but I just want to know what what are you going to do to me oh and why would that help now for ... yeah okay so\nI think she has a lot of them don't know what I keep pressure\nWe think it's the needles and it's a Chinese Asia or whatever oriental it is I think it's ... so like this that there is the and the strength and your hair they're super small\nOr do not only the time you don't even see them go in and it's been around for four thousand years and it's good for all kinds of things in fact\nIt's really good for weird things like why I learned how to\nDo it was because of the ... do seem to be real\nHelpful or something like ... like hormone\nMigraine or um neuropathy and a lot of debt issues and it seems to work really well with that stuff\nAnd how do you know where to put the needle series a system\nWhere you can basically analyze the person and see where they need because\nThere's twelve or any answer called which are like electrical channels in a body and you figure out what's\nAnd there's all the points on your ears that\nAre really specific for parts of your mind too so it's\nPretty pretty interesting but how how\nHey and there's two sides I always tell people there's there's different places where you can get acupuncture\nUm there's people you know I think there's a couple in town now that they're licensed acupuncture um one's name standing behind she realizes acupuncture and life was active country go to school [noise] um\nYou know after they get their degree and they go to four years of acupuncture school and there's a four year yeah they're really well trained and okay school\nThere's a couple of Austin I don't know if there's some in Houston or not\nFolks like empty the un PC which is a doctor Karadzic\nFolks like empty the D.C.'s which is a doctor contracting we go because we've already got four years of diagnosis and all that other stuff that we have to go extra to get training to learn how to do acupuncture most of our\nDoesn't involve traditional Chinese medicine which is why\nThey are ... okay no that's\nSo you guys work in tandem I Would guess sometimes a lot of times if you can't fix and they can't\nThere are people I sent her because I Can't think of wild well try my ballpark Anita you know that's how they look at that\nSo for someone like made it in the car lot may have back pain may have like ... where you start with me do you start with chiropractic or do you start with acupuncture well it it usually if it's not because I'm thinking I always need a massage my muscles are always tight but\nThat doesn't necessarily help they sometimes you know pat you and then other times they just beat the snot out of Iraq and you feel like you've been beaten but it doesn't make me feel any better either right so I think I Need something else right and so what\nAre the things when people come in like that you just you didn't have one particular place that her\nYou're just step all over right uh my back always tightens up I'm always step I'm always stress people you know in the money business you would want their money globs closings a lot of stress right\nAnd I teenagers\nSo that that that that's a whole that whole thing and Strauss yeah I'm\nUsed to like I tell people I have to have\nAnd a lot of times I'll get people come in on the acupuncture side round\nKind of like have you been to a chiropractor\nThink you actually benefit more from like a manual or physical approach\nYou know a car wreck side but then I get some people that are on the chiropractic side many like I got one lady you know a couple of years I'll give her the example she had a static bone cancer and she'd been adjusted by car\nContinue but but it hurts it hurts but it's not hurting with anything I can fix became anything I can fix so I did acupuncture on her\nWorked really well so what would you go in or they releasing pressure\nWell okay the one my uh the teacher that taught me when he explained it like their little intense and if you think about it like an electrical\nUm like electrical\nCircuits and the fact that he ever look on line at a if you just sort of hard if well if you Google ah acupuncture\nMeridian right a picture of it if you'll see a picture of a person\nAnd it looked like a little electrical circuits and basically they're sick for the top happier by six o'clock and so what\nWe try to do with the Neal and sometimes there's too much energy going through emergency call or two metal and they need to bring it up\nSometimes it's once I got a lot more gone the other and you know so it kinda does\nThat okay I Want to come in

conditions so we love from folks to come with those uh\nThose chronic conditions are and we share and\nThose costs so long as they enroll in what we call\nA Debbie our health track program that health tractors where\nAre we a sign that individual a health coach it cost them additional eighty dollars per month but with the health coach they set their own prescribed customized treatment plan goals the health coach those\nSupports and provide positive reinforcement and frankly accountability to reach those goals and objectives once they certify their accomplishments we celebrate their achievements end up\nDigital balloons for them at our monthly newsletter and frankly we're seeing people's lives transforms\nAs a result of that help track program\nNow Mr ... had some of these and I know you've been in this business a long time why why do some of these conditions just keep saying he knows what are you doing differently to how much is it just didn't turn the gene and accountability\nI think you put your finger right on it uh you know we all make New Year's resolutions wouldn't and wish for change in our life it doesn't seem to happen and and that is the missing a psychological factor\nThat produces change and that's positive accountability uh when I articulate my objectives and goals I say out loud what I Want to be and become an act ask someone to come and help resource and gives me and give permission to\nBe held accountable to do that that's\nWhat brings about lasting lifestyle change I've got to give you a quick example uh Debbie in twenty Seventeen we had sixteen hundred and five people joining liberty help share with an indication of\nThe need to lose weight that we have very frankly a very relaxed height and weight guidelines\nBut under our our program they needed to lose weight they set their guidelines or their goals and objectives and steps of action\nAnd in twenty Seventeen those sixteen hundred and five people loss together more than twenty three thousand pal\nSingh\nTimes that's on a cell with white\nWe actually take it one step further foreign minister balance that just is going to change their health care that they need the medications that they're on it's gonna change everything\nIs absolutely it is it of course reduces the risk for a for cardiac arrest and and heart disease it reduces the risk for diabetes it takes away the course of the stress on\nAll of the Oregon's in terms of bearing that additional weight because we all know that my weight is one of the indicators for future or future health and well that's right and so it is a significant impact in a person's life\nOkay how do we do the accountability on the phone because I'm sure this is all a song base correct Steve have coaching soil how does that work email\nRight it's email each phone but what we discovered a being such a critical factor is making a very picky\nA little ball and achievable goals\nAnd steps of action all of our health coaches are registered dieticians and sold their focus is on healthy eating and meal planning and in just a painting circumstances that\nDo you off track and they're not condemning there's certainly by no

good\nYesterday [laughter] and oh man I could so easily get myself in trouble today\nLet's just say that I did not speak of the Kavanaugh hearings yesterday intentionally I mentioned that on yesterday's program\nThat was by design why use I knew what was getting ready to happen today here's here's the deal but let me clarify a couple of things for your first time I spoke to my mom early I use this as an example\nCalled her early yesterday more so hey what are you doing she says I'm drinking my coffee and watching the news\nI said what do you watch and she said I'm watching Fox and friends said you're not watching the news she said well I'm watching Fox News it's it's not the news\nThat three people sitting around a couch talking crap it's all they're doing speculating and blow viewing period sheer conjecture this is not the ball they're doing is chatting no different than the three of us if I sit down and talk with my mom and dad and I tell you\nIs this is what I think is going on here this is what I think it's going to happen well I think the American people this and the American people don't they don't know crap\nThat three people giving you their opinions on a couch in the morning while you're drinking your coffee that is not the news and that's what happened yesterday and that's why I didn't want to talk about Kevin uh there was no news the only news about Kavanaugh is what was happening today\nWhat happened today cloture that's what happened today the Senate voted fifty one forty nine to end debate and go to vote tomorrow afternoon I think it's thirty hours that's it\nThat's news that's what happened today why is that important well I'll tell you why it's important\nBecause what you saw the left due to Kavanaugh's what the left has been doing to you over the course of the last decade they just through an entire decade at him in a span of about eighty seven days really they ... they said that it adamant about two week period\nNot an eighty seven day period the nomination process took about eighty seven days as of yesterday I think if they did a ... nine days today regardless they were desperate they threw what they've been thrown at you as a gun owner\nThis do riding you this calling you murder is calling you names blaming you for murders around because simply because you're a gun owner they blame you for the actions of criminal\nWhat they did with Kavanaugh was all of that thrown and they just do the kitchen thinking him in about a two week period sheer desperation from the left\nWould here's what I knew I was going to feed today I knew I was going to see Dianne Feinstein stand up on the floor of the Senate and literally lie her eighty five year old tail off it was remarkable\nTo witness first Grassley stands up gives his assessment factual assessment\nIs what happened on day one this is what happened seven weeks later\nThis is what the minority ranking member did and didn't do here's what she sat on here's what ... what was the result of that now any clear thinking individual knows everything that Feinstein did was working in lockstep with Chuck Schumer behind the scenes and Nancy Pelosi to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nAnd destroy his wife and the process that was all part of the plant any clear thinking intellectually honest human being understand that and today we got to see grass we talk about it it was followed by Feinstein who stood there and wide her\nThat fly hundreds of thousands of her ...\nThan ever changing my life ... hanging out there that I ... a true story of someone else is also carry every quarter they went and sat with troll ...\nPark which is why when you ... for ... for when I'm a guy\n... for one of four guys dot com fat for number one of them I'm not far from

dot com make sure to go there\nOoh well I told you in the last segment [laughter] the sleeping giant is waking right\nYeah walk right the sleeping giant is well did the Democrats actually think that the American people were going to fall for this crap I Believe they do yeah I Believe they are that unhinged\nThat they have over so many issues developed over a decade it didn't happen yesterday Brock Obama's election was some it\nIt took years to get to that they cannot believe\nThat Hillary Clinton is not the president they cannot believe they were rejected in the last election and they're suffering from mental illness as a result of that you saw what happened on that committee if you watched any of the cabinet here\nLunacy doesn't even come close to the description sick twisted demented\nEvil does and I stand by that description all you have to do is watch Dianne Feinstein did to Kevin on his family by sitting on those documents that she had an her possession she did it for seven weeks that's nothing short of evil\nKnowingly\nAt the eleventh hour coming out to destroy a man's wife and reputation because they're so concerned with power\nAnd agenda that sickening sickening it should be a crime should be should be put she should be put on trial as a result of that in my estimation ethics charge not enough that should be criminal which she did some hopeful Lindsey Graham do something about that's a whole different show\nThere's just the hatred the deep hatred that they show for us gun owners want to keep driving this home for you they know with him on that court your gun rights your children's in your grandchildren's gun rights are safe they know that\nAll of her Ninety five ... billion plus years\nThanks a lot for that California in the U.S Senate off at work that she spent over those Ninety five billion years down the tubes that's what this represents to her now the of the rest of 'em have motivation as well but the party as a whole\nNose at their house of cards just about ready to get blown over because they know that none of their efforts over the years will withstand scrutiny will withstand constitutional scrutiny\nBy a justice like Kavanaugh combined with the Gorsuch and the Thomas hopefully Robert cetera they know that with the sleeping giant the Republican to walk I Do believe we're woke conservatives are will gun owners are certainly well I think you're going to show up at\nThe polls farmers my this is my guest when I'm feeling it was just the sense that you can feel no I'm not ready to admit defeat in the house yet I've said on this program plus five seats I'm sticking to that right now I'm sticking to that I may be wrong but I Am sticking with it\nI'm sticking to that I may be wrong but I Am sticking with it you remember when I said Trump plus three hundred electoral votes some of you still want me to pick your lotto numbers\nGood luck with that [laughter] but I'm sticking with that\nSo the sleeping giant is awake and I believe you're going to go to the polls in droves now because you are just the gusting by what you saw\n\nMcConnell said it right the resistance resides within these halls he was talking about the Senate\nAnd Congress in Washington and he was absolutely correct\nIt's leadership he set resides in these halls and he's right he's got that figured out what the hell took so long we've known it for years to go back to rock Obama's presidency and why these Democrats act the way they act\n\nBecause they cannot believe that the American so yes they do believe in it they do believe they can't believe\nThat you rejected them they cannot believe it\nIn their right just indignation they just cannot accept the fact\nThat they have been rejected and their ideology has been rejected and that that rejection manifested itself in the election of Donald Trump they are they are just sticking by it to the point they are mentally didn't meet as a result and why they're acting the way they're acting\n\nTake away their guns right they ... as I said in the presidential election twenty sixteen I Believe some people are going to be very very surprised when they wake up the day after I Believe they're going to be very very surprised to go back to guns\nWe'll give you a little hint of some of the things we're going to talk about on armed American radios monster broadcast in particular they
