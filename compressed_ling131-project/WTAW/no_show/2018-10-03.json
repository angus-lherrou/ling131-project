I agree and we're at a time but I agree very very well said it is dividing us and the media doesn't seem to care because as long as the ratings are still high they're still selling address still making money they're all set and the fact is it's hurting us exponentially editing nine for one pack or at Joe talk show on Twitter Steyer\nRemember that although I doubt that it's around Ernes and his mother about how they did not like this country now remember what the New York times it was it fun to every memorandum read a story member when that happened to me I don't think it did\nYeah I don't either you know why because it didn't happen there were afraid to look into any single bomb had ever done and and that's it that's just it's disgusting instead of a look they they were good flowery pieces on Brock Obama evil in the economy was tanking when our our standing in the world was was lessening when we were sunny ridiculous deals that made no sense for us\nAnd our people and our friends they're kissing his ass this guy comes and fixes everything he broke\nAnd he's just he's like the devil incarnate walking around it's the weirdest thing\nTo do I keep going back to NBC News thing and this had happened during the Obama administration and he had a woman come forward with absolutely no witnesses and no evidence and it'd be the ... collaborated there is no way I feel there is no way they would have run that\nCarry it actually happened a guy named Larry Sinclair it wasn't a woman who was a man he said he was a bronco bombers gay lover and they did cocaine together right and and the media ignored do you remember there being a big story\nI don't know\nYet yet today somehow Eric Trump was told hey you better make sure they do she has her mouth about about though this is Stephanie Clifford idiot and you know my response to that was what are you talking about an MBA is a legal documents on hush money\nThan a harsh document I signed an Indian and work at this company I promise not to give their secrets out while I don't understand why why suddenly has an NBA the evil incarnate evil because it has to\nBe a President Trump students for\nDevil agreement or something that would be no devil agreement on disclosure agreement if it's a it's common in law in this country is not that that it seriously I mean many I'd somebody tweeted me they said my wife was a hairdresser and she had to send NBA does you wouldn't tell people I Do regarding here there yeah for God's sakes\nLet me go to the phone lines because a lot of people want to be hurting and and I don't blame you just a lot going on today and a lot to get to Mike in California Mike what's going on I\nDon't you know you got a call ... ...\nAnd if you don't mind what your face on the phone 'cause it sounds like it's far away I don't know what's going on\nI'm actually a lot of sort of a nose Okay Jim ... someone like\nI I did this a Turkish and so I really kind of get sacked I wrote down on ... and first of all it's not very common at somebody this rapist and use the word that I might have accidentally killed me and that's what was going through my head rape is a very horrible things very mean daughters I got daughters you know we know what it's like ...\nWhich by the way your phone sounds great right now don't don't don't change whatever you're doing go ahead\nI'm park on the freeway but no you sound real\nAnyways it's okay so you know this is the thing started with her not even knowing it she was done or rape\nThen it started with or started going from there to her husband saying it was ... and nobody really focus on the fact that she never knew who was\nShe just says that her husband was the one that told her when they talked about the door that one reason they did they say that she didn't like the way the door ... and we know that when we live in a house and we're going to stay there and you have the money if you're white to like something you fix it it was six years before she even thought about you know ... or ... years before the re thinking came up\nIn therapy but within the therapy knows all match and I know that in therapy because I go to therapy there and that's pretty good\nWhich he also said that there is a wrong she got away with saying that therapists notes were wrong but yet she was the one that said refer to my therapist notes right but then the one that really gets me and this is one that most people know all women will notice when I knew now with the dollar will help to girls go out together to a party\nAnd one of them doesn't leave with the other one there's concern the other friend will start looking for so called so want to know what happened\nThat would have been something they will remember\nShe said it never happened she was never there she doesn't know what she's talking about how can to France be that close\nAnd then at that night she ran out of the house now either she ran up right in front of everybody like she was saying at one point or she ran down and nobody saw lead but either way a best friend will find out what happened to you maybe not tonight but maybe the more they're going to ask why you left and what happened right\nAnd the fact that she never even meet I hate to this you know I think something happened to her too when I watch you know a judge do something I've never seen in my life America proof thirty five years ago he had an alibi without knowing it they\nHad a calendar that shows and in CNN disgusts me well you're going to put up a calorie show somebody's data on it but we've got the part that it's just football or weight lifting and stuff like that just shows why seven men right or you would in the same like the same time right they just ignore this stuff\nAnd I have spent the last four years going through a false accusation that I could the court I didn't do got dragged into another court\nJust for the heck of it because they can get away with it and it's not right what it does to our lives and takes us away from the things that we can't do anymore\nWhich is that going to do he did nothing but just like me sir what do you want to get to the country but when somebody gets mad\nAn hour if you'd cry when you're right if you're a man you're wrong if your military man God help you you got kids start tracking stuff starts taking video and just start watching it it's going to get really ugly if they don't put him through\nMy action I appreciate Joe we always appreciate a you know my calling in from California you know what happens sometimes is when you're moving you know whatever the cell phone to get a little bit shaky I'm Glad that he pulled over and it sounded very clear\nHe's right these right on on all of those accounts a bottle add to what he said not just a man and not just a man who serve the country somehow but if you're a white man and you're guilty you have to now prove that you're not that's just the fact that that's the way it is in fact that's the topic\nOf today in culture later on in our number three should make sure you stick around for that uh let me go back to the phone lines actually let's take a quick break and we'll come back take

at eleven O W T W College Station Bryan [noise]\nYou weren't listening to ground zero [noise]\n\nShould get a there was a [noise]\nPowdered substance sending the Pentagon it was intercepted of some of it was directed you're the president\nSaid Cruz's operas [noise]\nAlso received a mail that contained\nRice it which is a a a poison that can be made in the kitchen\nIs easy to make the buildings are Breaking Bad fans you probably remember the Breaking Bad um\nIt was actually use\nIt was actually used um\nMany times in the show there was also showed how it can be cooked in a kitchen with a simple things like a\nPastor beans and ... and stuff you can buy a hardware store\nSo it didn't it wouldn't take much\nFor someone to put all this stuff together and mail it out I mean the thing is\nWhen these things are used and are American citizens to target especially when it comes to leaders um\n... it's basically a having me question a lot of things right now and as I had a I I spoke recently at ground zero lounge\nAt a ground zero lounge we have a discussion about the test that's supposed to be happening tomorrow with the phones or this is the world as a nation wide chest\nAnd they're going to send a message about an emergency uh this is a a a fake emergency rather to drill a test to see if your phones are going to be working and ah let's see if uh you're you're going to be able to pick up on an emergency broadcast\nNow when I was at the ground zero lounge\nWe were talking about\nThe cabin afford a fair\nAnd we weren't talking about he said she said who's right who's wrong yeah cast ravines exactly are we um my ah produce just always there from castor bean that has been cast um\nWe were at the ground zero lounge in and we were talking or are we talking about about the cabinet Ford situation\nAnd I said to them\nI told them I said you know\nI said and I said on a few occasions that it was going to be some sort of an attack\nIn the attack would happen and if you remember we did a show about\nThe ... in Oregon and\nFor those of you that have seen the TV show wild wild country you'll know\nThat the reason or actually the ... the Russian each cult\nActually tried to poison\nOr ... county authorities\nBecause they wanted to be able to\nThey wouldn't come out and vote\nAnd it wouldn't be able to vote\nAnd so they when they put salmonella and the salad bars around the area so those who get sick wouldn't be able to go out and vote and it would reduce\nIt reduced the voter turnout\nAnd so this happening right now is this a rice in attack\nNot only happening the day before we're supposed to do this nationwide test but it's happening during a major investigation into a chief justice being um\nIn a nation in a time of the nation when we're very divided okay\nAnd what I what what I'm thinking about tonight and and if you can hear the ... you know I'm really kind of nervous about the show tonight mainly because of the fact of how close we come and how and how it's all happening here and what's going on is is real okay and uh\nAnd I'm trying to assess just how everything comes together it's ... it's like a puzzle\nAnd all the pieces are coming together in a in some way but once again I asked the question you know is there any investigation right now I'm not seeing I should put on network news on my monitors right now we're having some sort of debate with our governor ... uh our governor speaking or or or something I mean I Know what's going on\nBut it's nothing to do with the matter at hand today and I really don't think the mainstream news cares or are they even investigating or even trying to investigate who may have been responsible for sending this rice in powder to the president\nAnd whether or not this is an assassination attempt on whether or not as could have been some sort of a a a mini trial for decapitation exercise or\nIf this is something that is keeping us aware of what's about to happen to the phones tomorrow and whether or not\nWill be affirmed while you realize that if the FBI\nFiles that report to more\nAnd more than likely they will because they don't need till friday okay they don't need to friday to make their assessment and they probably won't take until friday everybody's waiting for friday they oh wait till friday no\nThey'll probably give the report tomorrow\nOr this is the thing is is it that I'm I'm the arising here they're going to give the report tomorrow\nAnd when they do they're not going to let the American people know the results because they\nDon't have to they don't have to tell the American people the results of that fighting [noise]\nAll we'll hear about is the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nAnd I have a feeling he's going to be and I talked to a lot of people he's going to be confirmed [noise] and if that happens I worry\nThat there will be\nSome uprisings that civil protests or uprisings or whatever you want I I'm not going to say civil war\nBut I'm I'm just feeling a little weird about all this since the rice and thing now since we've we've we've had the biological tie and I got something else and want to tell you that that were really for\nYou about rice and and what it does to people and if it doesn't kill you what it does to people it'd be very surprised of the symptoms and how something similar happened just a few weeks ago as well where we heard about the same thing going on we'll talk about that coming up don't go way\nSame same with the Ted Cruz\nYou know same were mad at the same with all the other people that were targeted today\nAnd I said and as I said before you know you go down the list of what happened when the anthrax\nWas released during the time of nine eleven\nPeople became infected in September\nThey were in fact in October\nAnd they were infected November three months of infection\nAnd there were gaps in preparedness for this biological attack but the difference between this attack\nIn in in nine eleven and two two thousand one in the attack that happened today\nThat something was happening we knew that something was going to go down and why did we know ... acts OK clay next was talking about this very thing the possibility of something getting released\nWe had the geena function exercises that took place with the aircraft\nAnd boy I have some news about this it's really good for you\nWe've had many bio drills and now we have the emergency\nReport tomorrow we have the test tomorrow\nAnd tomorrow we could see the wrapping up the FBI report\nOn the cabinet or Fort case\nAnd they don't have to give us the information they can just say well we did our investigation it satisfies everybody put it to a vote and when he's confirmed everybody said well what what had happened Didier didn't eat you won't know\nAnd I'm sure there'll be you know people screaming injustice here and injustice there will be a fight going on and all kinds of crazy so go on this is a pattern\nAnd warned you okay I've worn I saw it I I can see it and I and I'm very nervous tonight a little bit because I said some things that the ground zero lounge\nWith the the video it's up yet and I and I don't know uh when it's going to go up a recording of of the presentation but uh you can hear the audience I were talking about this and they and somebody had piped up in the audience is I'll bet they'll have a wrapped up by Wednesday and then I was reading something that the FBI is Betty ... ready to ah\nBasically summarizing put together a report released Wednesday and we will no we won't do anything about it and they delayed talking about until friday but apparently from what I gather tomorrow's the day\nAnd we won't know because they they don't have to tell us anything\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three three go to Tony in Indiana Hi Tony you're on ground zero\n[noise] hey quiet I tell you what that sits right into the pattern they uh uh ... you know there's a bio a drill all of a sudden it's alive they uh\nHave been some you know they've been talking about since the ... report about a biological attack\nAnd your hair and out of Europe how the Europeans are worried about Europe because sources banker friends are saying that they're planning for the collapse so this is something that's been coming for a while it just you know it may be the curing time for the rice and was a a ready on the Eighteenth so they've pushed it off as a third\nOh it was ready I mean a average and let me let me just a you know and and I'm going to have to repeat myself in the next door I'm kind of holding things up but I won't hold things up for much so um [noise] you anything about what rice and does to people when they inhale it\n[noise] yeah it's it causes a a massive influx of fluid into the lungs and you're just drowned\nWell yeah you can drown in your lungs but the it just depends on the frequency and what's in it and and you know it's worse if you swallow it it's worse if you injected because it can get you on a a a DNA level and the blood if you put it in the blood\nBut here's the deal hey here's the deal I was reading that if rice and is it gets into a human being and all of a sudden they start coughing and he started sneezing\nAnd the part of everyone that goes airborne okay yes and then people around you if you're around it they also get some of it in them and what they are showing these are showing signs of who they start showing signs of sneezing coughing nacho watery eyes a\nFever feeling and it happens it happens within seconds there is no into Beijing period it happens within seconds or maybe even a just a little bit of time\nBut anybody who is exposed to it you have a lot of people around you you start seeing all of them getting sick too so ... what am I the last time you know when was the last time we heard about this happening you remember\nRight after nine eleven no more recent than that\nUh that I'm sure you know\nRuin the Emirates plane landed a JFK\nOh absolutely yeah they had three of them there were three planes they held I think they only reporter onto though\nYeah there was a plane that landed in Emirates and they said that\nPeople have gone on board the plane in the lower level and there were two or three people that were acting like they're sick and then the whole lower level of the people they all came down with the same\nThing right and then they then they released some into the public and just let them go there\nSo you know that would explain why they didn't even care they release people that would probably ask you are okay you didn't get exposed all that bad the rest of you were gonna hospitalized no reports of deaths\nBut still for getting the function exercise if we released rice it in a plane or we put somebody on was exposed to rice and how would the plane react coming into JFK ride your time you don't have time for that right you know what time that Emirates plane landed at JFK\nProbably three thirty three no nine eleven Arab that's\nNot a shock I tell you what that the that the way they use numbers and the way they plan there it's just it's just amazing how when you start analyzing it how it is so true to form\nYou know what time they're going to do that test on your phone tomorrow\nWired to Eighteen\nTo Eighteen eastern time you know what I mean one is lying and what is nine and two\nEleven died in there yeah there is diverse yeah they do they do I went on there to so quiet or incidents [laughter] yeah it's all going to All right well are there last year by telling the truth I\nI Try thank you for calling take their hair All right Bye bye let's go to a really quickly in Texas I little you're on ground zero\nOh gosh she just nationalize the every can listen to your program [noise] and I'm not sure where ongoing other than I Believe that what you're saying tonight this is a major distraction to what is happening politically an auction change right\nNo it's done a major distraction it's an attempt it was an attempt to try and block votes and confirmation of cabinet\nAnd I think er or to the lady investigation because what you have the FBI chasing after who tried to kill the president who tried to kill people the Pentagon and they seem to agree with the same modus operandi of the ... the a rush speech pure and did in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four\nOkay or or Chile takeaway for this and I I\nBefore okay or what should we take away from this and I I\nYou know I'll tell you what it takes away from this be prepared because there could be something even bigger coming tomorrow okay now I don't know what it is I don't want to panic anybody\nBut I think that if we find out tomorrow but the FBI is wrapped up its investigation which I hear they have they don't have to report or give us any information about what they what they concluded in fact\nBig put this to a vote and say we voted and that's the way that they can report if they want but if they don't I'm sure there'll be a lot of people screaming vengeance\nAbout what has gone down depending on which way it goes\n[noise] best case scenario or ... ... s case scenario nothing nothing oh good okay\nBest case scenario nothing but the thing is it's already happened I mean the balls wrong I mean what you we Abbott attempted attack on the president where we have we ever attempted attack at the Pentagon we haven't attempted to the attack on Ted Cruz and his people now why Ted Cruz I have no idea\nOkay All right well I think it's a major just is trying to distract ... is really happening which is very significant in our world about abuse of women that I that minor compared to what ...\nI don't know how it's distracting us from the abuse of women the problems there and we know the problem exists okay I don't know how that is what this does is it it's basically it's terrorism to change political direction is what it is\nAnd I believe that it's domestic terrorists [noise] okay All right so really uh be prepared for anything tomorrow so I got that in fact I told my staff tomorrow I said tomorrow will be prepared we may be coming in early may be doing a bunch of things early because of the uh the two Eighteen thing I'm I'm just prepared for any I'm not saying anything bad going to happen but\nWe know that nine eleven was a drill we know the nine eleven had ah anthrax attacks attacks attached to it\nBut in fact she was going on for three months the results in the uh the aftermath of this went on for three months now we have an attack with rice and I mean it was intercepted of course you can get to the president President seems to be fine we had to hospitalized to staff members of Ted Cruz's office his campaign of [noise]\nSo whoever was doing this they wanted to send a message and they were hoping I'm sure to thwart the vote or at least the investigation into Kevin [noise] born Jew anyone else who's involved with basically really in the boat they're not going to believe them\nDribbling fix every three thirty seven hundred will be by [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWhat dot com\nYou can look out a window or click on line either way you get the weather though

is ignoring the fact that this the rice who was sent out today or that it was announced today that was sent out some within a Monday so it was set up today or some of the other things that are happening that uh that\nReally really seem\nWill put us on the edge will just put it that way uh I was watching a video of a\nThree protesters female protestors were actually\nBadgering senator majority leader Mitch McConnell\nWhile he was walking through Reagan National airport\nMcConnell wouldn't acknowledge them they were getting angry or they were acting like they were getting angry and they were saying how does it feel to be part of a of a party the Republican Party that endorses rape and sexual assault\nAnd uh\nIn fact a McConnell just staring straight ahead unfazed shook hands with some random guy the airport\nAnd one of the women yelled at a will yelled out these really telling you should the hand of a man while a woman is trying to tell your story\nShe said would you like to know if you believe the survivors of sexual violence\nOne of the women actually said one of the men escorting McConnell of solving her after she\nOne of the men escorting McConnell of solving her\nAfter she rushed up against and actually a he said I'm Sorry I keep stepping on your feet\nAny any moved out of her way and ah so\nYou know they try to get McConnell do an escalator\nAnd when he got up the escalator the women stood behind them and said Senator McConnell view always turn your back on women like this\nAnd then he asked if he would support a full FBI investigation well that's already happening is already made up your best to getting going on\nAnd uh I Would say that you know this this harassment once again Maxine Waters that harassed people and I mean where's it going to stop\nThe rice and being sent to the president okay why are we not talking about this is an assassination attempt on our president why why not why aren't we\nWhy are we still talking about cabin on Ford when that investigation's underway and I don't know of or any of the mainstream news organizations will tell you the FBI does not have to tell you\nThe results of that investigation\nAnd of course the rice and it's been sent out to people hospitalized for the rights of attacks that Ted Cruz's operas and what's interesting too\nIs it all this happened like this you know in a October November December right after the nine eleven attacks\nSo you know if anyone is supposed to rice and\nThen you know the first clue that you're exposed to it is but a large number of people who had been close to each other rapidly develop a fever cop an excess of fluid and their lungs\nNo person would come as a sudden flu and then there would be the sudden breathing problems shared by everyone within the vicinity of exposure and eventually figured all die but no you don't have to die\nAnd it just it just a reminder does anybody remember what happened on the Emirates plane landed the JFK Airport\nIt was like two or three from Dubai\nAtlanta JFK to prosecute nine eleven AM after declaring a medical emergency property a huge response from police are paramedics\nMembers from the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and screened properly five hundred and Twenty one people on board the plane\nSymptoms were like I just mentioned the CDC to prosecute a said one hundred passengers and crew can play the flu like symptoms including coughing fever a total of Nineteen people were sick general taking a Jamaica hospital in nine refuse medical attention\nAnd I remember the question on everyone's mind was hobbies so many people become so violently ill so quickly on an aircraft\nThere was no indication period for flu and no one in close proximity to a flu patient would get the symptoms were copier and chills\nIn that short a period of time\nSo now we have a compelling argument for getting a punctured exercise rice and we're a low dose of rice and they had been used on that plane\nAnd perhaps his needs to be investigated again by officials even though rights is not the most deadly poison in the world is been tagged a category be average security risk aided by the CDC\nAnd it could be considered a biological weapon since it's so easy to extract by a by product in the preparation of castor oil and what is more it is extremely easy to purchase\nThat stream of easy to make you can go on Google they'll have the recipe and you can make it into\nMaybe watch Breaking Bad well\nThat's that was the uh\nThat is a that is the ah I guess the poison of choice for Libya\nGives you ... and several other people too\nSo um anyway\nTripoli six every three thirty [laughter] poison of choice Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred\nThat's AAA six seven three thirty seven oh in a reminder tomorrow is the day where they're going to do that telephone exercise where you're going to be alerted [noise] on your bones in an emergency a fake emergency is going down [noise]\nTiming is everything right what do you think Tripoli victim and three thirty seven hundred a AAA thinks Seventy three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\nIs go back over should existing papers you all their ducks in a row dot the I's properties comeback give their decision to vote goes down he gets confirmed the American people were dumbfounded they don't know what's going on\nPeople who don't like the idea get angry at least starting harassing people even more and maybe even worse than that\nAbsolutely and and the other thing is it's it's just um\nIt it it's interesting that the whole I mean you know\nIt's it's just um\nIt it it's interesting that the whole I mean you know you are are definitely you know obviously you try to stay out of the political game yeah and I you know I tend to lean right or whatever you want to call at I mean nowadays that's totally got a horrible\nThing to even align yourself with any side of the team but um I just think it's interesting um that I Do a Google Search like a like a traitor so on today I'm listening and I'm I'm kinda just good when this whole thing\nAnd nothing is really coming up it's like sticking out I mean no I mean literally like Google race and toys I mean this the whole thing\nFox News comes up a couple of times which right wing whatever I mean you can see the parallels are those are the you know the the patterns but\nIt's just it's just kind of weird that nobody's really you know having a big a media discussion about this\nWell I don't and right now the breaking news on CNN Trump attacks cabinet cues are just days after calling her a very credible witness\nSo they're still maintaining ah this this sexual um he said she said division that they've been doing not only with Stormy Daniels and the president now they're doing it with a doctor for in a Brett Kavanaugh so yeah they they seem to be the scandal channel\nThey don't want to talk about you know what is going on behind the scenes the rice in attacks\nThings that we've been talking about the we were preparing you all for it now happened\nAnd uh you know most of the American people I I really don't think even knew that ... or even know now it's been going on we're making it clear on all the stations where on that it's happening and it's because we told you be prepared for the final blow and part of it now we see is some attempted biological attack on the Pentagon\nSo do you do you think though that they're they're trying to shove this aside I mean it I mean and again not to get to political but do you do you think that if there was a Democrat that was the president and this was happening do you think because again you\nKnow I Know a rental oh golly I've got a rice and attack once ah so I don't know about that I saw\nThat now I don't even remember that though I mean I mean so I I don't know yeah I guess maybe maybe I'm a draw the conclusion is not there I mean\nEveryone I don't really always leaning left\nSo I I don't know well and remember who all got attacked after nine eleven it was people like Tom Daschle who was a Democrat\nI mean we're in these terrorists want to push a political agenda they don't care or or the target certain people because there are about to make certain decisions and so there are getting the president of course they're talking to president for one reason Ted Cruz still or we'll let the or the other guys I mean this\nThis is something I put together today I mean first of all I came into work that I wasn't feeling well I haven't been fully my been dealing with um some sort of a respiratory thing\nAlthough he don't have rice important you know I'd I'd ride and boy it'd be very hard today and I was in the middle of writing a brilliant brilliant piece you're going to be here this sometime this week\nAbout a a more and more and drama and aliens and pride and a planet X. so I'm I'm hinting and something that I was working on today a masterpiece I'm hoping\nBut are doing this came up uh I I saw this and a couple of news director said well you're talking about this because you called it and it says why but you know I don't know I I don't know if this is really it they said well you said biological attack\nAnd rice it is a biological a poison is derived from a castor beans\nAnd I said oh yeah when it comes from is Kathy Castor oil he says yeah they'll accident and I said okay\nSo I said OK yeah or this and then Alex Jones is on the phone with us and he was saying well maybe we can talk about this and then he got sick so that I'm supposed to go on his show later on this week so it's just that it can master confusion\nBut see that's the way it is when something like this happens and you don't have a mainstream consensus that you can play from\nYour plane from the the information you got and all the information that we've been reporting before the event so what you see are you seeing a you saw the event before the ... and now here we have a a retro causality happening where you're finally hearing that yes there was an attack\nIt was a biological attack on certain members of certain leaders and leadership a military presidential and also a Senator Cruz so there we go\nAnd and and the race and that means for when I was reading on ... which you know or or whatever other sources CDC I I saw on line I mean that this actually I'm surprised they haven't tried this a little more I mean it sounds that sounds scarier than the anthrax thing\nWell it it it does if it's a big dose and it can kill you but sometimes if it's not a big enough doses it doesn't have to kill you you can go through the um the sick feeling in the in the flu and then what they do is they have to give you drugs to comfort is it gets through your system\nAnd I'm I'm beginning to wonder if what happened on that Emirates plane was exactly rice and test to see what I Would react yeah well I mean it was the same I mean think about it if you're on a plane and everybody is complaining of flu symptoms fever chills seizing copying a pneumonia like symptoms or whatever\nAnd you're wondering how is this maybe one or two people on the plane may have been sick and then a whole level of a plane gets sick and then a whole level doesn't get sick how did that happen happen because the direct Dina function exercise that they were doing below below deck\nAnd and all those people were in fact or at least affected by rice and maybe are socialized put into the plane\nRight yeah I mean it wouldn't take much putting the ventilation system that'd be it I mean\nThat'd be a small amount small droplets getting in there just to see if we are capable above you know getting a few people affected by it and then uh whether or not they sneezing coughing spread it that would be\nAnother reason why some of the people were allowed to walk out of the hospital and ah and not have to face any treatment that would mean that they did not have the flu because they wouldn't you but people were contagious they wouldn't release them into the public\nRight yeah I mean the CDC's stance I guess is that it's not I mean I guess people are asking that question is apparently because ... they were very clear on the CDC website that uh it's not contagious from person to person right um\nI ... the only other determination we can make with the symptoms that they showed was that it was some sort of poisoning that happened to them whether it be food poisoning\nOr some other poisoning that uh everybody got it once but it it gave them I mean a normal virus meet everybody would be nauseous and having the diary of perhaps but this was copying sneezing watery eyes ah you know a lungs feeling heavy tightness in the chest all the symptoms of rice and exposure\nWell ... ... ... you know it's fascinating but the rice thing too is that you were talking about castor oil I I just it's so fascinating to me that I mean a lot of Canada so I'm not in a medical professional as electrician\nHow how long the hell is hit dead you can have a castor oil which you basically from what I read real quick you press beans and you get this oil\nBut you can you can drink the oil as a as a lax it is but right don't get the rights and poison it but I just get it from eating them mash\nWell that's ... that's the beauty of chemistry right now like you know you you can you can have a big old spoonful of castor oil to put you in the bathroom for the ...\nYou you can you can have a big old spoonful of Castro that puts you in the bathroom for the whole day or you know you can have a you know the powder they'll put you in the hospital for maybe a month so there you go [laughter]\nBeauty of chemicals that and he would have been begging for the call ... six every three thirty seven hundred ... six seven three thirty seven hundred\nIsn't this just bizarre the way all this goes down and how the timing is everything and how we were talking about this what for months weeks okay so if you follow the program and just want to remind you if you want to follow the program go to SoundCloud dot com slash ground zero me to go back\nAnd you can see documented all the events that happened it was around the September eleventh like talked with Alex Jones and then behind that and all that things went down to go back to quite acts if you want\nEven listen to

president was ah in Mississippi last night ... kind of took a tone that a surprise some people\nPresident Trump took is make America great again message to Mississippi last night but spent much of the time mocking Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was\nThe president blames Democrats for holding up judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court\nThey've been trying to judge Kavanaugh says\nHe was President Trump hopes Republican anger over the issue will translate into mid term election victories next month Carmen Roberts Fox News and\nYou know at least right now it would seem like that will embolden the the the Trump supporters to get out and vote 'em we'll see\nYeah but they already know what's going on at least most people do if you're if you're the president and this kind of situation just\nJust don't say don't say anything\nLike that's the first time this has ever have yeah around I mean that in the ... what was it the other day with the reporter right yeah whatever he said oh you're thinking well that's a that's something new or you never are thinking\nOr something um yeah I mean that's just just just\nYou know I Wish it was on TV Sunday\nBut I saw yesterday a feature story on Ted Turner and Ted Turner used to be much the same way I mean yeah he was he was actually doing Donald Trump stuff before Donald Trump was\nBut he was ... when president no he's big boisterous he was a ... a billionaire he could say anything that he wanted and so normally he did\nAnd so as a result um he really got a whole lot of\nFace time on camera level plus the fact the hit CNN which probably helped a little bit you know but but nonetheless he was a he was much the same and you know when you see that now and it was Thirty years ago when you see that now you just go and you can't say that kinda stuff [noise]\nSo anyhow we'll see what happens the a president will be coming to Texas at some point he's going to come down here and do some is going to campaign for Ted Cruz who you know he said some really bad things about during ... presidential\nElection race but uh hey you know that's all forgotten now because after all he won but junior is going to come down here first Donald Trump junior is going to be a in Texas too\nI think campaign for I'm Ted Cruz I Believe Connor oh let's see what we\nGot Donald Trump junior has to Texas today with a message that if Republicans don't get out and vote in November that his father's agenda will be in jeopardy Trump junior stumping today alongside Republican Senator Ted Cruz Republican rallies in Wichita Falls income row followed by private\nFund raisers including the lunchroom in Austin and had dinner in Houston as Senator Cruz remains locked\nIn a tight race against democratic challenger congressman Beto O'Rourke Jeff from and also Fox News ... [noise]\nUh why does anybody have already [laughter]\nBut anyway so juniors in town and then the president himself to be into and ah from store to the Texas Tribune their mentioned that you know in a poll in June eighty percent of Republican voters said they approved the job that Trump's doing that may change a little bit because the capitals situation but he will impact the ah the election I Would imagine so\nSo so junior going to go like out on the boat on Lake Connor that'd be pretty cool is preached to the masses out there [laughter]\nYeah that's why there might be nice in death right yeah he probably good but now I don't I don't think that's the case but ah anyhow I think that's um I don't want\nYou guys got something to entertain ... no I was like well you know Trump also came out and said and this is something that you've kind of touched on Scott and that it's a a scary time to be a male in America\nNow now that's not saying that it and it's not scary to be here well may I may ask you can have both okay it's it's not like that has to be one or the other because I have a good friend that was on social media and took to it obviously and was you know outraged that he thinks you know trying to being a woman\nIn American this let's not compare okay but in this day and age I think it's a scary time for anybody that you can have allegations brought up in a he said she said without necessarily evidence that people are automatically going to believe you're guilty\nSure but it's also scary that you can be a victim and no one will listen to\nYou know and that's true too so where do you find the common ground I mean it's it's really tough and you have to whenever you bring something for you have to have proof and and just kind of put all down stress but yeah it's it's a it's a difficult time for everybody but again there's many things that you can probably take issue with what Donald Trump says\nIn that particular case I don't think he's that far out in left field but you know and I'm not saying that one suddenly negates yet what I'm saying\nWe just have to be really careful because social media allows anybody to have a platform and then anybody of course can latch on to that and they hold out a longer or lifted up\nAnd well and you know the court of public opinion has only gotten that much bigger than that much stronger with social media because like you said everyone has a voice and typically you know I thought about this the other day how many times do we go to social media and say you post something and granted I Know you guys are not necessarily with y'all but with other people you know whether it be Facebook\nOr Twitter you post something that's opinionated that has to do with being laughter being right and you really you really want people to actually debate you\nKnow often do you actually do that versus you just want people to patch you on the job in mirror what you're saying and say yeah right on that's basically what you're doing you're wanting self assurance that what you believe is the right thing for well I Will\nSay one thing where social media will start helping I should say in in future cases like this is there will be proof and there will be more ways to to tell whether someone is telling the truth or had a little bit of you know backup versus these handwritten calendars from Nineteen eighty two\nAnd sell as much damage as it dies you know we talked about you know no one will be able to run for office soon because everyone's going to have tweets and posts that\nYou know no one will be able to run for office soon because everyone is going to have tweets and posts that you know a a damn then in one way or the other but at the same time maybe it'll help with you know future accusations actually being verified well and\nYou know go back to the sports world I mean how many times have tweets old weights that are you know like ten years old or however old from athletes come out I mean you know you talk about Josh Allen a guy who was a quarterback was taken in the first round and during the draft those tweets come out\nAgain and I'm not necessarily saying people just making derogatory comments about you know actual pictures and videos and things that have been taken at\nThese so called parties or you know when the when the actual you know sexual assault allegations and stuff like that sexual misconduct when when those allegations come out on you know that something where I Am a social media may be harmful but at the same time it could actually help prove someone innocent or guilty\nAnd it's almost like an electronic paper trail yeah Adam ... you know you need a paper trail now we will have an electronic footprint or what do I watch a show her and they want to use that

be paying attention to this report first response comes from Dr ...\nI Would suggest that the purpose of the report is to give the local community a good sense of where we are today\nThe more aggregated data sets that sometimes we think about like a local areas personal income or local area of gross domestic product those measures come out annually and they're often delayed\nIn terms of their reporting it it might be up to nine months old or a two year old by the time we know what happened last year but this index allows us to look at current monthly data\nAnd to derive the the business cycle from monthly data series that gets us are really timely indication of where we are today and Bryan College station and I\nCompletely agree bill and thanks Sandy for that I think for us what we've seen is that appetite for people to really from a business standpoint understand our local economy\nAnd I'll be Frank to make really critical decisions for their future and the future of their business and the future of our community what we found is that that data was really needed in a more timely fashion\nAnd so to be able to bring that you know as a resource for the business community um I think is what at least from my perspective is so much of a game changer\nMap when you say critical decisions can be made based on monthly information can you give me examples of of what some of those critical decisions minding\nIf you look at some of the things that are happening right now in our local economy um our unemployment rate is it two point nine percent\nUm employers and employees and developers and sites electors are interested in that they want to know they want to know also what our employment rate is they want to know what are real wages are\nSo being able to take a look at that in a more timely manner although the index is not predictive in nature what it does is it gives an accurate trustworthy snapshot of where the local economy is within the most real time data that's available to us and the data series\nThat we used to drive the business cycle or or things like monthly monthly unemployment ranked non farm employment it's also available monthly\nTotal sales subject to the sales tax is available on a monthly basis\nAnd then on the total wages paid to all employees in College Station Bryan that comes from a quarterly data source so those are all as a frequent in his time later as we have available and those um from those four series\nLooking at an independent we'd have a\nA way to think about the business cycle but our modeling allows us to derive the one kind of common component from all for those series\nAnd it allows us to produce this business cycle index and then the business cycle that is presented in this monthly report\nYou're listening

the two agencies have combined to start issuing a monthly report on the local businesses in economic activity in the twin cities Matt let me have you share the results of the first month lair report\nYeah so really interesting data that's happening there so you'll find that basically the business cycle index rose at an ... an average of three point nine percent in July which is about the same growth rate as in June\nThe unemployment rate dropped two two point nine percent in July which is a slight decrease for the June unemployment rate\nReal inflation adjusted wages grew at an annual rate of fourteen point three percent during the first quarter of two thousand Eighteen\nAnd last but not least the real taxable sales and the College Station Bryan MSA stood at three hundred and thirty\nSo ... and the College Station Bryan MSA stood at three hundred and thirty three point six million dollars in July and they're up to seven point one percent from the same time last year\nMan I

leading to a lot of opportunities for commercialization kind of at every level\nAndy did you notice any surprises once the numbers were compiled\nNo surprises I think one of the things that will see is that we'll be able to track the cycle of business a cycle of the economy with this new index\nAnd the thing that is looking at the historical data\nThere is a sense in Bryan College station that because we have a Texas saying them as a larger employer sometimes the consequence of the business cycle might be a little ... here\nIn Bryan College station and that's something that we were

specious allegation about why he lied under oath you committed perjury and then that was completely blown out of the water because I guess NBC News reporting on this\nDid not report everything that was said because he does in fact say that what happened happened or that he knew about something that was happening\nFact say that what happened happened or that he knew about something that was happening um and it was reported as if he said he didn't know which wasn't true\nSo the whole thing stinks just do the bowl ready Jeff Flake is out soon and if he is going to be a lobbyist as Michael Malice was saying the other day if he was going to be a lobbyist he's not going to get a whole lot of help from people on the right I'm In that he's trying to stop this um this nomination from happening it's very strange to me I think you will at least see\nMcCaskill and probably um who's the guy in West Virginia mentioned you're probably will see them um go for Kavanaugh as well so it probably will be fifty two\nFifty one or fifty two maybe even fifty three depending on what Collins and Murkowski of these in these others do there really isn't anything else they can drop now that would be relevant to stop this vote from happening\nBut I Do wish that somebody would ask the question and I think it's a good journalistic question\nHave senator Booker grow because hey senator Coons say senator Harris hey senator Columbus or\nWill you vote yes to confirmed this guy if the investigation shows nothing new but nobody asked that question I think that that's a valid question we go to the phone lines and say hello and welcome to ah going to be lying to actually barber wants to talk about Minnesota politics the barbecue old on\n'til after we have dug ward low he'll be at the bottom of the hour this way we can talk to in context to that uh that it\nIt's a race for attorney general in that state that the entire nation of the world is watching between Keith Ellison and Douglas we'll have more information as we do that when you go to what is it a go ahead\nI was getting into that you mentioned senator Cory Booker didn't hear what he said\nYeah and I don't know but but somebody said he was on ... what do you do well\nThat book or is that and this is from Fox News and the ongoing FBI probing the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh he suggested this than it needs to quote move on to another Supreme Court nominee whether Kavanaugh as innocent or guilty\nShe I mean when you're when you live your life through such a scope of Ashley Wagner Murray as as grow up with this does when you live your life through the lack of rationale maybe we should move on from him being a senator because he admitted the groping somebody we're sifting\nMaybe we should do that we do is that carry I don't care what side of the aisle you're on can his sentence that he just made me just reported cannot make sense to anybody\nWell now and it goes back to what you were talking about because now he's saying his credibility cabinets credibility is being challenged in his temperament has been revealed at last week's hearings and whether he's guilty or innocent he really shouldn't be on the Supreme Court\nMakes no sense All right the neighbor's dog on line six dog what's going on\n\nIs your name dog it says the old geezer Doug what's your name\nI Know you can hear me because\nI'm looking at Minnesota been on hold for about an hour last chance and get out of here I let you go back to it and say hello and welcome to a shame and Fort Worth ... what's going on\n[noise] hey how you doing Joe living the dream Shea what's happening\nI Am a first time caller so they never really called into show before but I have a son I wanted to ask you about all\nI Want to see if I hear is a as terrorists or Kavanaugh and I'm frustrated that based upon what you were just saying about so it's a saying let's get a hat ready to have somebody else yeah\nThat's kind of a similar thing that I was going to throw at you monitor and about and it wouldn't be completely at all fair to Kavanaugh\nBut I don't understand the timing of all this I think that he should go through but when you're talking about these three centers that my vote against and we're talking about a Democrat over here or something something in the Math Doesn't add up I I don't know how much time I have till the next election\nSo my mind I was sitting there wondering not that you can trust any do you make with a Democrat but if the deal was elect Kavanaugh go by the wayside and Trump pick any Bartlett for example is her name\nAmy Barrett beret come up I don't know\nIf you can totally skipped the judicial process of the Senate committee and all that kind of stuff to just say okay we're going to get rid of him then he gets to name her and she goes through and we don't even have all this dog and pony show going on about it\nWell she didn't even know why should I gotta run 'cause I'm right up against it but uh it'd be interesting question ... and ... and I think that there could be a recess appointment but I don't want the president to make that kind of deal\nNot even for a second I don't want the president to make that kind of deal I Want him to stick to his guns this is the right guy he's extremely qualified there's no reason to disqualify him no reason to move on\nKeith Ellison thought that he would be the chairman of the DNC he was actually is that when Tom press one and and now he's the the vice chair as you said this is one he's one of the faces of a party\nUm and he's faces these allegations when you said this very well known repeated these are recent allegations I mean as recently as August ... the route of hand sun is out there you know publishing the allegations me this isn't something that's thirty six years\nSun is out there you know publishing the allegations reduced isn't something that's thirty six years ago that you can't remember what how she rain or one day the week it was her who went there um is is Monaghan fully cooperating because you would have to assume\nThat politically she might be similar to him since she was linked with him for for a while she cooperating and will there be a prosecution in your opinion\nWell it shouldn't be a criminal investigation they should be the fact that the Democrats in Minnesota right around the clock they try to early voting has already started in Minnesota and trying to round the clock or they're trying to call her investigation and of course things past November steak\nOr by that I actually have a you know and that they will occur you know as a write in this round the clock and and we've got to stop them from doing they are in Dallas and one of the ... the Democratic party nationally\nWho wants to be the attorney general Minnesota and you said that on television and said that he wants to be turned out so he can basically obstruct across the gender he wants to bring lawsuits against the president\nOn things from immigration to the Internet was the lead the charge a democratic state attorneys general ... Oregon the president and that's just an appropriate\nAge I dug wardlaw he's the Republican running for attorney general in the great state of Minnesota I think he should wait in the polls are very close right now but it's important to reiterate what you just said he's running or just as an anti Trump guy the attorney general's job I'm guessing you know 'cause you want the job\nIs not to make law is not to bring frivolous suits is not to to argue because of your political or religious or whatever persuasion it is to follow the law enforce the law do the job I mean Eric Holder\nProbably was a very good mentor for key fell as soon as to what he would do as a G because as the attorney general for the United states of America Eric Holder only took his walking papers and\nTalking papers from Obama and obstructed justice of if nothing else\nIf you get the job what do you see the job as and keep in mind Minnesota was almost read almost when Trump in the last election so it's a very very tight race for a good reason what do you bring to the people who are listening and watching right now that that Keith almost including\nAbsolutely is Iran to take the politics out of the ... law they trade is a law enforcement positions in the legislature make the laws\nAnd the executive branch including the attorney general enforcing the law of execution laws and not rank policy not right away the ... or ... out of the office and focus on eating Minnesota ... say ... or saying lungs are very simple message and this ... process or\nA ... it's Doug more low A. G. dot com Doug ward low W. A. R. D. L. O. W. A. G. dot com Doug as as I'm watching TV all the same as saying he is like gladly saying I I Would love to bring more refugees here\nI Would love to keep on bringing people in that we don't really have a chance to vet um that we should probably fight the president's attempt to stop bringing people in from places that we can't bed and Minnesota should just be worthy of where they put these people but that isn't really odd tactic why don't you think that's going to work and then why is he tied with you in the polls which is strange to me\nWell we're we're we're going to name recognition and and building that up until about\nWhere we're still getting the message out to folks and it's going very well and you need to raise a little bit more money and get the message out there and I think that as the incredible across the state of folks get and that is out there that they're coming on board in droves and we have the momentum that's very good ... else's answer all the more you know you work in a mate eighth grade I here in Minnesota\nWhat would it be where I actually couldn't hear what you said he wore\nA T shirt in the May Day parade here in Minnesota that red in Spanish I don't believe in Bor I recently interviewed and said that he thinks general orders create an injustice so how can a person that was leading the concept of reporters in the state's top law enforcement official\nWell if he doesn't believe in borders Doug I'm gonna go on a limb here he doesn't believe in the sovereignty of our nation\nI mean if that thinks that borders should not exist he's literally saying Canada and Mexico are part of his country\nAnd they're not I mean there's a reason why people keep on trying to come here because it's better on this side of the border that's why the border as necessary so we know exactly who's coming what they're bringing with them whether they're legal to come here and so on I ... I could never understand the guy like a key fellows in saying\nEverybody should be able to flood the state because that will change anything of course it'll change something they'll bring with them whatever it is that that was bothering them or didn't work for them in their in their previous country\nUm the ... that's an important piece of information\nIt's forty one eye it's forty one to forty one right now fourteen percentage point you're telling me are undecided\nUndecided you're listening and they're watching right now ... key fellow students history as an alleged abuser is important is history has an open borders guy is important but in every ... in everyday life for Minnesotans they don't think well I Wonder the age he's doing from you today\nSo why should they lean your way and not his way because again once you're he takes the office they don't think about that job much\nRight they should come ... Ellison if he were elected as Minnesota let's say as a less there he's ...\nHe's going to wait X their resources and waiting for a war against President Trump was just completely inappropriate is going to be too distracted during all that to us on the thing that they shouldn't do namely that in a county attorney and prosecutors they brighter than the ... and they\nAre dealing with human ... or a problem with that in Minnesota there's things that need to focus on it and bring a lot worse than our deal with\nThat we'll just see the glass it by ... too busy waging his political wars\nAnd it'd be waging a national political war which doesn't bode well for an individual state where he should be enforcing the law Doug I appreciate just dug wardlaw AG dot com and W.
