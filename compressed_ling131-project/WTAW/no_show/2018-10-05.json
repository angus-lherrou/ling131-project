been a positive for society\nBut as I Believe you even brought up yesterday this has been hijacked by political side of the aisle mhm and it no longer is about being sympathetic caring or or empathetic to people who have gone through this now it's about who's going to be on the court who's going to be the president who's going to be the senator who's gonna be the member of Congress\nAnd it ... the entire thing I think ... is going on right when she looks at Hollywood she wonders how is that\nHow was Hollywood have their so called me too movement\nI was there for me and I don't think that it is All right we've got to get a break here we come back it's going to be Zachary ... though he is of course from campus reform dot org it's a great website great young reporters who were getting the job done with a legacy media can't to be more\nA you know extremely extremely unprofessional\n... that's a a practice known as doc so many people watching don't understand what that means so she publicly on this three thousand word blog instead of responding to you directly as a journalist 'cause that's who you are I'm and she also she let people know who you are where you want her to get a hold of you basically we're sticking to the left on you\nAbsolutely and I I think Eric Trump had a perfect response to it as a ... and a power player in this town he\nSaid look this isn't so much about you know a person issued isn't Democrats or Republicans this is a lady that inciting violence\nAmong sitting members of our Congress I think no matter if you're a liberal no matter if you're a socialist what have you I think you know condemning violence is something that we should all doing stand together and doing air Trump said it that he said look you know I'm a big Georgetown supporter but this clearly cross the line um many people are speaking out many people are frustrated and I do hope that ... the correct actions\nIt is ... so he was a great correspondent over from a Kibbutz reform dot org I'm this Christine ... professor of fair thing is is not so good at which would have been the second but I'm One would expect to Georgetown would say look\nShe's somebody who is in our employees were going to reassess because there's obviously something going on we don't support what you said we don't it didn't say anything about what they actually said was and of course we were wrong they said well that was your private thoughts on her personal Twitter has nothing to do with us\nAbsolutely yeah that's exactly what she said and then also today a you know fresh off the news press if you will in the newsroom campus reform you know we got wind of a student that basically came out and said look I was in her class and had to drop is due to the rapid political bias in her spouting off\nUm and yet Georgetown has yet to respond or you know to those\nSpecific allegations you know I I Believe this to be a complete abuse of power um you know we have a professor that is you know\nAbusing her power and and saying you know you have to believe what I Believe I Believe is extremely uncalled for and we would think that at a top tier research style institutions like Georgetown\nWe would see some type of you know curtailing of this or or some type of you know making what is right here because they do pay so much in tuition writer or so so I find that to be extremely unfortunate for the students I Do attend the university I Do I did have a friend that attend to Georgetown University and they were telling me\nThat they just want to stay away they just want to stay away and I I Do I Do I Do a you know myself after being attacked\nI'm you know and Abigail quite viciously or you know I I see it firsthand\nIt's a group or a truce though we're talking about Christine fair she's a professor at Georgetown University and I use the word professor loosely um of course executive rate corresponded from campus reform Cuba's reform dot org\nGo there every morning I'm long let's get into a Twitter did now because Jack ... recently Jack Dorsey when recently to Congress should he claimed that you're really left but we purposely or unbiased on the actual platform\nThat isn't true I'm I'm shuttled banned all the time I I can tell when I Am because one person sees us you know tweet that I put out where I Know fifty nine thousand people would love to read it\nSo that's ... that's not true they have immunity from liability um does Facebook him does Twitter because they promised to be unbiased\nAnd they're not when it came to Christine fair she was verified I'm ... and nothing happened to her for the first twenty four forty eight hours than people like you and me Eric Trump and others are started re tweeting and asking jak directly what are you doing\nAbout this this person who is actually say I'm inciting violence kill these people\nFeed their genitals to swine what are you doing about it to the news just moved to her account with the letter back on very soon thereafter without diversification badge the news has been good it again and now from what I can tell she's back up is that really is that the ... now you know that ...\nA Twitter a to cancer and formed a a ... actually told campus are born that they made an initial mistake on first suspending her on Twitter we haven't yet figured out why she was I was sick\nOr we haven't exactly figured out why she was suspended the second time I'm button my opinion look this is clear incitement to violence I think it's quite hypocritical and it's almost a double standard that Twitter has jumped on that\nTo to unfortunate look a you know ideas you know if we're all about free speech will make it their free speech let's not make it you know the type of pick and choose what what what we politically you know identify with I Twitter I think Twitter has a long road ahead of them out to correct these mistakes and I hope that they do\nI I'm with you that reproduce or greater our correspondent over from campus reformed up or let's go to University of Texas at Austin just up the road from where I'm sitting right now where I guess the young Republicans dared say support Kavanaugh confirmed cabinet or how did the left students respond about\nWell they were simply having a peaceful protest a you know supporting that a judge Brett Kavanaugh I Would think\nYou know this would be a mere gathering and people are changing ideas but no the Latin yet again turns to violence which we see too often as a corresponding here in Washington DC you know I see people marching you know and and and protesting which is important but yet it turns the violence the left as we turn to violence or attacking people in airports and I think\nI Know actually that a majority of the uh I'm Mitch McConnell said it perfectly said it perfectly on the world I think that we are not going to stand down to this left this idea of you know violence and all cause that attacking people in restaurant runs at attacking people at airports this\nOn college campuses is exactly where this type of idea of attacking people of a violent protests as coming from\nAnd they weren't they weren't

I've noticed FBI thing was submitted ...\nFrom CBS the general consensus that far from Republican to view the FBI report about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's background is that it healed no new information or additional cooperating information Democrats however blasting the report add severely incomplete\nSenators on Thursday I think in terms of you in the report falling demands for a more thorough investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against President Trump's nominee the White House who seemed to report overnight and transmitted it to the Senate Judiciary committee for each member of the Senate had the chance to do any single copy in person on Capitol Hill\nRepublicans do plan to begin voting on Kavanaugh on the Senate floor friday with final vote on Saturday the Senate Judiciary committee Chuck Grassley claimed to report reveals nothing they can they need to not already know and veils no contemporaneous evidence to support the allegations\nSenator Dianne Feinstein the Democratic ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee said quote the most notable part of this report is what's not in it\nI Want senator is the only have one copy on their board to review and a secure room in the basement of the U.S Capitol\nThe White House and senators have ample time to review the seventh of background inquiry into Kavanaugh's record and senators on both sides are expected to do with a report in one hour increments an effort to limit the possibility and potential leaks and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion Wednesday for cloture vote on Kavanaugh for friday\nIt was close to the situation and I tend to pay their confirmation though to come sometime Saturday and protect scheduling will come from McConnell\nWell there you go the\nBottom line is I don't see how the Democrats who stuff is even if they wanted to and trust me they want to I don't see how it's going to happen now now let me ask the general question to those who are listening and watching it eight nine four one pegs in an eight nine four one Seventy two four seven\nAre you ready for this to be over now and maybe even better maybe even better um\nHas this energized you whether you left or right Democrat or Republican conservative or independent or liberal has this energized you know polling seems to say that the left\nIs a little embarrassed by what's going on here and maybe not has energized and the right is like awakened so I wandered eight eight eight nine four one packs Joe ... dot com has this entire debacle\nAnd\nThe bottom line that the left just never really gave this guy a chance and we're only resisting because it was a Trump appointee has this ball over their faces heavy overplay their hand have ... at the end of the day prove themselves to be ... children\nAnd you know you see McCaskill's probably gonna lose you\nSee that ... who who is it in I'm In North Dakota and think of her name she got much well points now she's going to lose out the Senate probably will pick up a few of us Republicans\nInstead of seeing fewer Republicans and more Democrats as these were were promising and expecting they're going to see fewer Democrats or Republicans because people are awakening to the fact that\nThey don't play fair there and trying to be fair they're trying to find the right person\nFor the court they're trying to find somebody that well they're trying to stop or you don't realize that they they would be happy to have eight Supreme Court justices for the next two years until twenty twenty\nThey think they're going to winning twenty twenty the presidency they would be happy to make it an eight member record and have a lot of ties and when a tire happens at the Supreme Court Terry what happens\n[noise] uh I don't know what happens which I mean as you do 'cause you\nYou mentioned this right the last time they send it back to the previous ... right so the Supreme Court will be powerless if the left gets its way I Know of course were to blame it on Trump but it's on Trump's fault is their fault\nThey overplay their hand I think the Republicans are energized and I think that things are starting to turn right now you're going to make plans to go and vote those sitting your hands are not voting midterm you got to go and vote and let them know has to do with this whole thing was we come back we'll be Gary burned former Secret Service officer right here on the Joe ...

W was president of the training center but I\nI came back to the White House from time to time and one weekend I was in the west wing visiting with one of the other officers a buddy of mine\nAnd and brands have no came in and he said hello to my ... my my coworker he would seem like a very nice\nGuy and they said or who's ... those little counsel's office in ... he actually said there's rumors about him like this guy is going places everybody lives in the ... and the rain clouds and he is you know a true constitutional die and I said oh and that you know hey you know like I didn't mean much to me that India\nAnd then not too much longer probably a year or so later a W comes out to the training center where our dog and pony show at the secret service training center and go and and I was lucky enough to be selected to do is on range or safety with the Pentagon so anyway\n... was on this trip so when all this started\nHappening um I called my friend that they used to work in the west wing this guy worked in the west wing lobby for years and he retired last year and I said hey\nTell me about common now anything Gary I'm telling you I don't recognize the thing he's the nicest\nGuy everybody loves him I he goes if I he goes if I gave you a list of all the Democrats as I saw in the White House and the west wing sucking up to this guy because they knew he was going places while he got the it would have all your this guy is incredible he really is the good guy that they did that\nAnd now and now you've got these these are people in the left this lady and Feinstein and and Cory Booker in Kamala Harris in a global sharp you've got them painting a picture and and Blumenthal who's a ... big fat lie or about Vietnam\nYou've got the painting a picture of not only a guy who would as a teenager lay on somebody tried to take her paintings you would just wrong you can't do that and it turns out there is no corroborating evidence\nHe's also a guy who will put his junk and somebody's face while she's drunk which again nobody corroborate that but he's also got spike the political quaint loads\nAnd green alcohol to set up rape trains now compare that a good press that to not only what you know of him 'cause you know the guy but when you heard about him for almost Thirty years how does how does it washing your head does it just said hey you Gary this is politics like we saw the Clintons and the left do it when we worked there\nIt is not an object and just to be clear and like I said I've only been in his presence twice right\nMy buddy knew very well and this guy you know I take everything when it's coming from him it's just like it's coming from me as far as\nYou know but I Will tell you that you know who that sound like that sounds like Bill Clinton that sounds like Ted Kennedy we're talking about the Democratic party who took a guy who drowned the woman in a car and then ran for president in ... and years later writer\nSeniors later these people will do anything in say anything to push their social agenda it's a fact I mean ... you know if you don't see it by now then you know what you're gonna you're gonna end up being the first one they put up against the wall is this incredible\nIt's Gary burned B.

don't want that to happen now the Saturday against Kentucky\nRight right um you know what we're starting to see now is the fraudulent tickets which is is poses a challenge for us you know last year we saw a some tickets meaning the paper tickets to encounter food in and this year we're starting to see a ... the electronic fraudulent tickets\nSo the advice to those who want to wait until the last ... months ago the ball game would be one\nThere's only two authorized sites or that's the twelve man foundation instead of those those are actually the only to authorize cites\nA check and his

those\nUm the paper tickets um you don't see too many of those anymore since everything's pretty much electronic\nUh but what we've seen this year is where a paper ticket has the bar coach stolen off of it and then it's posted online\nAnd so you you purchase that ticket on line and so the ticket is not good anymore\nSo certainly buyer beware and at your own risk\nAbsolutely and and if you're going to buy tickets or somewhere else you know what you want to look for is if you have a paper ticket you want to look for what blurry printing on it I'm a lawyer tickets will have the pin thin paper
