Jay Sean corporate not here to return of one hundred yards water where to start that game on Saturday\nIt was I mean we ... we wanted to start fat guy was very important to get out the blocks and we did that on their defense of all three favorites or opening kickoff block extremely when I knew I said that we were just a few inches from from getting that than we barely made it by a few inches I mean\nA kickoff are so tight when you hit it when you're able to ... and what have we had to go walk two guys came off where two guys rather garnered made an extra effort do back and just I mean just got enough with a guy and Larry prior to the same thing and a little way and it got him right in that Greece and when you get out and he was he was able to go finish and\nHow close those things are as a great job of the whole team they block it very well and he hit it and great for freshman to be able to do that and you saw that\nLet us as you talk time and again how much you like to get the ball in his hands and\nFrom it and it's so funny because you look you look back there and you see ... who you are saying is also just just a little bit away it was like okay so we're going to try to take away from him and it went right to ... ... what did you wash back there yeah exactly [laughter] have you found a guy and we\nGot to get him going in the office and everything to where I get that going to say we got out that way and and him and he got to take a little load off our trade young companies got twenty nine carries but it got going to tell you what he forgot to hundred pounds he can carry it but uh he did a good job we've got to get those guys are the longevity this season plus a really good players yeah\nI wanted to also mentioned you talked about this low earlier today you also hinted to offset that defensive line is going to make something happen and boy did they would the five ... and everybody all the stars on that on defense of why it had a stack\nOf yeah that that I mean I mean I don't know how many times ever my career I've had every defund Islam and have the fact that didn't happen like a when you have big number ... sometimes two or three guys get 'em all\nAnd I got a great job in ... but also not just in the back and played the run I mean they were physically runway at seven three announcing the game and to think through they did a great job of sudden change and we had the to turn over their meaning when they got three announced stop the momentum again got the ball back to us which was very critical\nYou don't like to turn the ball over I understand because it does allow you to score but that three in al becomes important date on the door if my partner always talks about momentum when you have if you don't want to get out of it and when you don't have it it's hard to turn it around\nIt is they take it takes a team effort a total focused you really have to get down and grinding ... because that team is playing on their motion they play high a little more juice and you'll be able to stop that was really good that that's what was the thing that was disappointing because we can do so well we got scores they've got three now and then took a beautiful drive on often\nRight down to film scored it hit the first play the ... the next first play\nIf we don't miss one block and we go on a first what [laughter] I Wish you ... seconds lasers that [laughter] that would help but but you know you you gave it right back you know what I mean and that's the thing I Would I'm trying to teach our guys and make sure they're aware of that when you have somebody and you have momentum and you have 'em down\nI caught taking her whole boy I mean it's just like you know that constant barrage you're just pound if he was a man and then they get pressed to say okay we're down three score now we've got to make a plane and they make a mistake and you go out for that way really good and we're learning where we're we're in a process of\nLearning we have even in practice practice I mean when we practice that stop today and listen that's why we were we were playing really good then we get one of those laws how\nIs this is exactly why we do it in the game and you can't do it on the practice field I mean they don't do it on purpose\nSome guy that they're not cognizant they just kept trying hard but Dr hardware good it is okay

I'll tell you this but that does she talk about cause I heard that the FBI did not interview her or a judge Kavanaugh confidence because of the limits that were set on by the White House\nNow she didn't talk about 'cause I I honestly didn't know that going in\nAnd I actually saw that a drudge right before the show okay um but I mean the scope is the scope is the scope I don't think the White House could have said\nYou may not talk to this one that won him that that would've been weird and had that happened I Would have been leaked almost immediately mhm had the president said sure do an investigation just you can't talk to the people involved that doesn't make any sense\nSo I don't know how true that is the the veracity of evidence I'm looking at a drudge\nIt says FBI lax approval this is a report lax approval to talk to cabin on Ford\nOr this was put out by a by Bloomberg and I don't know that I'm buying like I'll be honest with you a little bit of buying that I don't I don't understand\nUm but they claim of course the person that they're interviewing\n'em but they claim no of course the person that they're interviewing is Coons who is anti cabinet ... who is the guy that stopped\nThat stopped um\nFlake from voting ... the way he wanted to vote so I don't know how I look I don't I don't trust too as far as like a pro the guy be honest with you but I Will see I have no problem asking that question next time I talked to the White House\nBut um I think that if that were true it wouldn't just be Bloomberg that would be everywhere to be the top news story and they would have response from Sarah Sanders and I haven't seen that have you\nI haven't I didn't see a press briefing today um I haven't seen anywhere else so I but\nI was and it would be that that that would be the top trend I don't think there's any doubt that will be the top trend that I'm ... you don't the top trend is how stupid is this that let's just be honest you're how stupid is this ... did you get the the president's alert on your cell\nPhone I did at one Eighteen or going to bother you I'm now\nThan bother me you know the less problem is and bothered then\nWhat do you know what the problem is a why\nIt's called the president's Willard oh well I\nHave a\nCarrier you're with the messengers and a level of rubber room but we don't need to be in this country\nYeah I think the more important things to worry about\nIt was it alert for the White House there for a presidential alert had the president been Brock Obama during the presidential or do what they said look at this guy now bronco bomber was a nurse or still is he's an arrogant dude but of course he can call it the president's alert\nI Would not have said boo about that\nMhm [noise] I mean how\nCan we just complain about things that really deserves some blame him because I don't understand why they call an alert that he sent out a presidential alert\nGuess what those have you on the left\nAnyway but it is now you know yes the al ... or ...\nOr ... girl deja president [laughter] I'm just telling you this\nIs nothing you can do about it let me go to the phone lines into say hello and welcome to ah let me see eye to James who is in Minnesota James what's on your mind Hi\nHey you've got hammered out well I'm In Minneapolis thunderstorm\n... I Can't hear you my brother just about to be what's on your mind okay\nWell you know I'm a Republican or if it's from a listener Phil every day but there's always this one thing that nobody really seems to talk about and I don't even talk about it but what if you know tapping our rights from Donald Trump although the FBI investigations are you know here say or what not what if it turns out that it's true\nWhat do I F ... and the letter what if the Democrats are at what is our next step what we do that you know because we're you know we're pushing against the Democrats right now you know on everybody how bad they are and what not but what if we went we went through and I think it\nWill James I'm going to answer your question very simply you it can't be proven true it can't possibly be investigated to an end that proves that the Democrats were right because there's nothing to investigate so even even thinking about the possibility of being true with no cooperation\nEverybody else refuting the claims completely she doesn't know where she was when it was ... de ... year even how many people were there the names of the people that were they're the ones that she has named ... refuted there's there is no chance that this can be proven to be true so in our system with due process\nWe assume that he's innocent we assume that it's not true until somebody proves that case against him\nMy point is very simple and it's very logical there is no way to prove this to be true not by the evidence that we have now if there's something somewhere that somebody you know has\nOn this that will prove it I'll listen and if it proves to be proven will take it down that road but what I just said is is verify oblique accurate there is no way to prove this allegation\nProbably why the allegation was was thrown out there the left knows it can't be proven they just wanted to slow things down would you agree with that\nI Would absolutely\nSo I don't have to get older that it's not and I got to run here I appreciate you but it doesn't have to be a consideration because there is no way legally or logically or rationally to say it's true here's why\nNonetheless wants us to say it's true because she says so don't worry about all the problems in her story it's true and it's still true even though these four people say it's not\nI Can't go there there's no reason to consider whether it's true because nothing has been presented to suggest that it is\nIt's a good question though I appreciate that\nIt is a editing nine for one pack jaded eight nine four one Seventy four seven we sit down with my friend um\nOh gee for Latimer puente is now giving the as three hundred system by the way it's not the newest one Russians how the U.S four hundred and which is more than ... so he they're not giving them the new stores are but nevertheless they want to say hey here you go here's this missile system\nUm and hopefully let 'em reporting thinks this is going to bring Syria's some stability so that's his game plan\nBut the key to this missile system be an anti Tomahawk missile system is the president or president drops fifty some odd Tomahawk missiles on Syria when Syria was using chemical weapons against their own people would just stop those missiles are resistant to Israel missile system do we know\n[noise] ah well this missile system is\nAs I said it's not the newest one so the analysis that I've read suggests that even airplanes that operate their Israeli airplane for example will still be able to evade this missile system they just have to be far more careful about how they operate 'em so it's not the most immediate threat\nTo our operations but it's certainly will require us to be far more cautious about what targets we strike and what means we use to strike\nRight it's a lot of it so I'm Sorry you're committed whether we're off\nI'm from the from the Washington Examiner when you bring up Russia we don't talk about the people that much and they're going to ask you about this last time but you'll know better than anybody do the people there like us not like us in Rio's hate us\nI think that we're the enemy I Know that during the Cold War we were the enemy we're gonna come and kill them at any moment and just like we've we've thought the Russians were gonna come come and try to kill us at any moment of the Soviets\nWhat are the people speak there because from any videos or or any sort of life in Russia I'm I'm sort of things I read about they seem to be modernized they seem to be kind of like us\nYes it's a mixed bag or my mother actually you mentioned she just came from Russia visited my grandmother a for a few weeks she just came back yesterday and she was telling me all about the media coverage or the President Trump the United states and ... American relations are getting in Russia and surprisingly has been rather negative\nBut perhaps the ... of the fact that that President Trump has done a lot to represent America's interests and he has pushed back on prudent when putting\nMaybe thought that President Trump would be a week so this just goes to show that this administration has done a lot there but a lot of this negative anti American sentiment in Russia comes from propaganda letter reporting for years it's a state owned media network there in Russia\nYou know we wanted and we make at all to not be an independent journalist there\nUh well the very few I Would say the biggest difference between\nRussia and the United states is in the United states or you can be a journalist and you can get rich but criticizing the president right but in Russia more he's getting rich by a a burying critical journalist who they are so rich that they're right there you go so there is a lot of uh there are some small publication but they never get a chance to really fully develop\nSo that people bury their opinion about skews it really based on who we are it's based on what the government tells them we are\nYes for the most part it unfortunately that is true because as I said there's simply not enough alternative media to push back against the governments there a narrative now a lot of people do understand\nThat a lot of the information that they are getting a from the state controlled media apparatus is false and it is propaganda um but unfortunately uh I Would like to see that number um become much larger in the future\nIf you'd have a lot of your off you use that contributed to the Washington Examiner\nAnd and from Russia originally is Russia only aligned with Iran because we aligned with Iraq you know in that war is Russia only lined with Syria because we're aligned with Israel\nIs it really Russia reacting to who it is that we're aligned with ... and ... maybe even broader than that why aren't we why aren't we a little closer why are we are like minded we we both teamed up against against Hitler\nAnd another we immediately started separating whatever the whatever the benefits were the winning of the war\nBut why are we more like minded why is it why should always that we shouldn't be an opposing sides of any either civil war war that's going on between countries\n[noise] ah have been searching for the answer to that question for years it just seems to me\nA ... it doesn't end at the same time it to me it partially does a I think that we have a lot of common but I also think that we have ... Russia and the United states\nFrom the very beginning if we take a look at uh the founding of this nation many Americans do not know that Catherine the great was negotiating behind the scenes with an England to actually sent as many as thirty thousand troops to offset the French influence in the revolutionary war\nThe from the very beginning that we're um\nActually it wasn't always think of your side I Know that really Russia was gonna who's gonna you know we've got to counter balance France's help\nAbsolutely ... on the table twice in the first time\nShe actually changed her mind said oh that was an air and translation the second time to agreement was on the table but French have learned of Russia's plans and they said look Catherine the great\nIf you're sending a fleet of going to be intercepted it will never make it to the north American shores and took out there and decided that it's not worth and she had a lot of trade agreements going on that she didn't want to violate rake\nShe decided to remain peaceful so but it it just shows you that that type of history that we had from the very beginning really set the tone for the rest now you do mention mentioned interesting point about World War two um yes Russia and\nAmerica fought alongside in World War two of course of the Soviet Union at the time and many of our soldiers died alongside one another but even if you take a look at the type of conflict that was happening or Russia really was mainly operating in their sphere and the United states was was fighting against Japan and that was not a lot of overlap\nAnd of course there were two fantastically different ideologies which explains the fact that after the war ended we immediately went into the Cold War because\nWe always thought it was on luggage in building walls and saying well this is ... and this is free decision free it's very strange that you would think that that that we would sit down and say you know\nAfter what we just saw um Hitler do let's make sure that doesn't happen again let's just leave Germany you know one country and free let's not break up you know a check in the Czech Republic and Slovakia the whole thing is to me is just very strange because we have a like minded goal to be a war which was\nLet's do what we can for the survival both of our people\nMhm no I agree with you\nAnd I mean look I agree with you with a broader point I think we should be friends and we should try to become friends that's why I Walk on President Trump's or you know messaging and hope that we can one day a enter a detente with Russia um but the question is whether or not within will be willing to do that our whenever wouldn't leaves whether or not um the next leader of Russia will be um anti American\nLast question for a lot of beer off he of course in the Washington Examiner I'm I Know that you don't have the details on this but in a very broad view is Russia through the propaganda that you spoke about through newspapers and television media and so on are they doing the same sort of thing in your opinion to propagandize what's happening politically here\nIn this country through Twitter where anybody anywhere can jump on a website and try to affect the outcome of elections like the senatorial race here in Texas between uh this guy Robert frayed social work calls himself ... and and Ted Cruz\nDo you believe that Russia has some sort of be a want a desire to jump into the fray and mix things up and make us hate each other here\n[noise] uh maybe uh unfortunately decision America has become so politicized where it's difficult to draw objective analysis and you actually look at the fish objectively\nBecause liberals have literally hijack that they're using it to undermine a president's election they're using it to undermine or his administration and that's very very unfortunate I think Russia\nUsing it to undermine or in the ... and that's very very unfortunate I think Russia a certain extent as far as their long term strategy is concerned uh will be interest and interested in these stabilizing the United states right um uh how far they're willing to go in order to make that happen\nI don't know uh and I would like to see more research or perhaps intelligence reports on that matter but uh I think it's possible\n... it's a very interesting thing I saw some news story last night that that suggested that was going on in ... into some level they've always try to use the propaganda against us I just wonder if this new way of doing it digitally um is happening as well Nikki let's talk again very soon I always appreciate the knowledge\nAbsolutely thanks for having now and again\nThe key to Vladimir off he use that contributed to the Washington Examiner we're back after this will be

we got the uh emergency a broadcast they did a they're saying now that they're going to set up a vote\nOr for cabin on friday and I had predicted Saturday So up by a day I guess maybe they have the information they needed from the FBI and they're not going to tell us as I said I'm I'll be looking into that later we're not gonna talk about about tonight though but I just saw a headline they're setting up for the vote\nOn friday instead of Saturday So obviously we've got the information today\nBecause they have to have at least one full day\nTo tell everybody was going to happen\nAnd so\nThe good thing is we haven't had anything bad happen today because of any decision\nBut we did get the information sent by the president on the phone as I said I'm\nAs they said prepare for anything so this is what has happened basically ah I get the feeling that the FBI sent the information as I said they would\nAnd then they're setting up for a vote on friday and Saturday So I was wrong about Saturday\nFriday yeah and uh\nFriday and Saturday So I was wrong about Saturday friday yeah and uh I guess I'll have to look into when I got the information also they found the guy\nWho actually sent the rice and which they now say was basically a castor beans\nOr be sent castor bean ... to\nThe Pentagon and the guy was from Logan, Utah\nAnd a ... I\nWould actually he was in I think it was ... Idaho but he sent them from Logan I'm not sure see there a lot of stuff has come in\nBut of course uh\nYou know the redirecting everything now everything was like panic the White House is under attack panic there's a biological attack panic and then they turn around and said well it's now just caster beans\nSo it's not rice rice and beans it's a\nIf it's\nWell it you cast or beans make rice and so yeah they got rice and it said this is the way they\nTreated about they say president what attacked village around and say well the president was attacked but it was with rice and beans and rice and then they say but we arrested someone who sent the rice and they they don't even know they didn't get their story straight\nWe don't have their story straight so that this is how\nYou know if I'm reporting something in the in the mainstream media says well nothing happened today absolutely\nNothing happened today um but somebody did after they they arrested the guy who allegedly sent the rice and beans\nTo the president so the rest of the guy um it looks like McConnell Mitch McConnell is now setting up for the vote for cabin on friday\nEither giving a day a couple of days for them to get ready to settle in and had come up with their ideas so obviously\nSomething came down I actually posted a last stand on my Facebook page some documents that I got from the Senate Judiciary committee and they already had sent that message out yesterday that they were going to have a decision the FBI was going to the decision to date so that's why I was able to tell you but it was also a Fox News report that said otherwise\nSo it was actually said that it was going to be a report today\nSo um you know take it for what it's worth information is information but it just seems like you know right now everything is\nIs there's like this intensity\nJust so you know putting you in that world for a minute because I just got this information and then a lot of people are like clamoring and calling and saying well a World War II was something that happened when they all alarm went off the phone well no not really I was at my friend when it happened um\nAnd uh and and I got mine and he got his like about a minute after me\nAnd then runs that he didn't get his\nSo be weren't getting their messages but I just thought it was kind of weird and it was scary actually to have this being loudly beeping\nOr in the car with me today\nAnd uh it was ... it was the presidential emergency broadcast so we said it was going to happen\nBut see just because it doesn't happen in the same day doesn't mean that this isn't a trial run for what may happen and that's what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for the shoe to drop by ... I'm waiting for is they say the final blow I'm waiting for because they said on Alex Jones show I said you know it's going to be some sort of a\nI'm a terrorist or or some sort of a a biological

I mean these poor kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my class as\nWell had these terrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they wanted us so that would give them like coloring books and crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are cut that the ... in in the lines are with the numbers more but some of them has it's terrible it's your campus that they would\nRule follow in your own coloring they would rule in ... was in school you were at\nWell I was I was ... yeah I mean the special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was yeah children like that\nOkay I but I Will be cleaned it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that doesn't mean anything to them er and er so anti but you know what they learned a skill that they were never going to use it you know there was no really cure for them back to and even today just really no cure so as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand\nAnd the kids needed two hours for lunch for the teacher said would help feed them or there's no papers to correct\nThe bigger kids that had them in the room\nUsed to move back as long as I enrolled us you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was a giant rolls and he put the boxes on him to shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't you know\nYeah so this isn't the school supply\nI enrolled lives in my class sideline up the kids I take until it can get a box but it on the island world he was flooded out the next get they get they would open it up the slide it down to ... put something in an decided down to the next ... tape it you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time so you always I Know how to Boston so I started bar tending to nightclubs and I believe this is\nA real prerequisite of what why this thing that came to this house when you do have a two jobs John\nYeah I mean it is that being a special ed teacher didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too so um\nYeah so uh uh ... you know people at night they're looking for I Know a lot of 'em real stand up people but there was a certain percentage of people who doubt no doubt talk sided thing because these people are like little wicked have looking for a cause\n... alcohol or drugs or commit adultery anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheists they went to the coast a little bit\nMake joined I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behaviors enemy bobbing factor but to us over the years I noticed that a lot of these people died from\nAccidents like car accidents overdoses suicide cancers and [noise] and I bought it with these people in ... and I do them you know uh but I felt that these people like ships in the night without a runner\nAny way that I Would take them to do with a ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died this state that I thought nobody should die\nThey were the last rain unusually high\nYeah unbelievable\nAnd so um you know I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing this book is going to teach you how it teaches you the nose I self you know knows I sell\nIt or not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means knowing the truth about you you are what they do look at what you'd do analyze what do you do then analyze what you believe about yourself you might find it\nCompletely different person here I mean I had one friend I Try to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into the ah his name is Chris he was a button that he worked right alongside and he was an atheist and the\nUsed to make fun of God used to make fun of you just used to make fun of the earth and married and he smoked and drank every night seven nights a week\nHe didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had four states can't oh\nSo he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from the school my school job and my night job [noise] ah we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know what\nI Know he had this ... yeah it's about forty years in a in a few months and he died within a few months\nBut I Would go visit him and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more bitten out George because of the diagnosis he had died he died in such a terrible state he died in a state no one should die and uh I I felt like helpless form\nNow in my relationship with told if people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially this no one to pray for them so I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and they felt they were friends of mine and they would ask God you know don't send these cells to hell that unless you go to hell until I finished\nPraying for them no matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left and an hourglass that's what I was going to do and I believe now that was the prerequisite of why this human creature this compelled to possess my house and a bill that mosaic fill your piece by piece right down to every single detail\nKnow do what we can really will let me ask you this little John do do do this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not you know the audience absolutely not I've never had like a and I've never\nYou know I never ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on\nYou know I never had a ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use it ... or I never use terror caught I mean I I Believe that opens the door for weeks it like this to come in and I don't think anybody\nDoes that because I now I think if you are allowed to speak to come in hillbilly you harm I think if it meant and him it was worse when you're on the other time\nYou had no there's no doubt if you if you invited in each coming\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you did in violence is\nAbsolutely not I've learned a lot from it I learned that it it has a methodology will discuss that too but the only other really other time or or you know I thought that I worked in ... that's why I wrote that book anyhow that's the best selling book and if you're interested in any of that though I had some funny stories about the rapid Chris\nBrown and that's that's a topic we don't touch\nWe do what we we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] but anyway\nPeople probably why it was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah OK study on the other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered it he meant that I Believe was with my brother my brother Paul ... we had just a rare a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it killed him very early in the sixties had a heart attack and died a thank God rather was unfortunate for you to get\nAre you OK yet it seems to me are you are right\nYet what with the ... disease\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to call you and I'll tell you\nFelt ball they wake up and they had the same symptoms my dad had pets they dialed nine one one they ... they come and they take 'em to the hospital and at the hospital\nHe died on hospital bed and when I went to visit him later on he said ... you know and I heard that he died on hospital but that's what the doctors told me sit down and when I got on a hospital bed I left my body\nHe said I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically and and they're ... find the getting back to life again if they'd be late and\nNot uncommon and\nYeah and uh alarms going off and he said that when I talk about that fit the mention a spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still sort of thought he was in the hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body and that hospitable\nHe said to me it and it and then there was a dark side of that room he said and demons came from a small team is not like\nBig ones like three foot four foot tall ... came to me and it was grabbed me and was starting to pull me into that dark area of the room which I\nWhich I say it's because they are they overlap them type and I believe that we're with overlap him at fifth dimension and ah they were dragging him into that dark side of romance and I finally got back to life he was able to get back into his body and he said to me Johnny\nWhy didn't even come I'm not really that big of a person that you know I don't understand ... why would even come in I was like boy I really don't know\nUh I don't know if anybody but no I Know that you know all of us are right at the same way like I said you know got a religion confirmed in our religion he was too but he dropped out and okay ... to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married what okay and again I tell them you know you got kids\nOr you never gave them a religion that anyone you can't even ... one one prayer\nMaybe it's like I'm not well I well I don't know maybe get a big kick in your but sometimes when you when you pass into that ... mentioned you know that that we were at overlap somehow\nOn John we're at a break but we'll come back

your brother your your brother at the time what happened\nYeah so I'm just to recap uh probably the only other time it\nSo I'm just to recap uh I mean this is probably the only other time I've ever had an encounter with a devil\nThat I Believe that you know I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it and he wasn't really a bad person I mean okay he left his religion like we talked and then he he lived through the woman he didn't get married to him and he raises kids didn't have a religion so\nAh you know I felt that made me but he said you know to me ... you know when I died on that hospital that I left my body I watched the doctors frantically trying to\nUh get me back to life again with the ... the latest and the nurses running back and forth sticking things that my aunt and they could hear the alarms going off it was\nBut he wasn't that like that dimension that overlapping dimension I guess\nAnd he said it was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping to mention there he said demons came for him and he actually was why the demons ... man I was like ... [laughter] I really don't know why why you know I just don't know how to explain that either I I never had\nThis problem I never had a problem like this before but not before I had this adverse and in my house but um\nI Wonder about his lap and he's a uh like he's just completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nScared the heck on moving\nA cab them better believe it I mean to actually be dying dying and then\nYou know leave your body that's something you know she's going to remember he's the he's still young guy is only like forty years old he's got a lot of life ahead of him but he now has a very religious person but uh\nHe encountered this statement but the one that I encountered was very different like I tell you that the ...\nYou know what was the first episode huge on the demon showed up what\nThey all K so uh let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right in the ... area I have a house that's on like an acre property Hoboken or yet\nAlthough [laughter] pretty far from that a good hour though oh are you from hulk Hogan and\nI'm sure not sure what to do [laughter]\nOh yeah well I was born in Brooklyn that's not that far from home but now I live in New Jersey so Oh yes\nOh I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire\nYou know I didn't have to work with those I loved do skits believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at economic I guess you just stop and I stopped ... are sending at night and I love bartending at night but er and that but I stopped but I still know about those people they still pray for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of why I had to separate Russia so now I'm In New Jersey now\nSo I'm doing fine you I have a very uh elaborate prayer life uh I I retired from my by my job as a special ed teacher retires that not working at night and I missed those people a lot too\nAnd I have this nice house and it sounded like ... okay\nAbout a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come in to the house and yet the the garages are under the house and you fill your car into the left and you go into the garage is in the back door the as you come into the garage and in between the garage\nGeorge and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I have three boys here growing up and I got a little bit bigger they wanted to a little more room so I had the basements finished and uh I cut it in half and it had an apartment building down there so my first wife yeah so that he wants to more space that he moves down there yeah you have your own interest\nYou pull your own spawn come and go as you want to say\nYes that was nice so then he goes to college and he moves out thick and boy wants to have apartment and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out my third boy\nHe wants that apartment he ... he was in there he he was he had this whole time so he's a U.S and when I had the he was the smart one free rent [laughter]\nYeah well I didn't mind you believe that we had this big house and then like when he he he went to college he moved out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we got its big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean so I I like having a ... a company to you know somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while when when you saw him he wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then you've got a great often took us but anyway he's you know the whole time\nSo that the upstairs and so in the basement\nYou come in that that I endorsed steps that go up to the kitchen\nWas a big kitchen the okay if you're in the case and you can almost hear that or an enclosed and then next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George\nAnd uh that's what I like and I I go to the gym in the morning to meditate in the afternoon I meditate in at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for a life that I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at that is a small little towns that God gave me you know\nSo uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last ... and I felt will last those every day\nFor years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nAnd then a bang yeah so then yeah I'm sitting I'm sitting in the living room\nAnd that I endorse downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I enjoy like slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it from in the in the living room but I hear it's slim like it never was lamb before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house at twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking I said what was it was I don't think my wife could even if she came home and sleep that like I don't even think she gave him slam that do that hard and maybe my son can I don't know why he would do that unless you had a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up\nI go to the kitchen I looked downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with in a lifetime to still talk to you so I go into the\nRoom and board I have a a surveillance system here right they look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors and look at the camera their faces that during the back nobody went through the back door ...\nAnd or what you would you ... heard it open\nOh absolutely slam no\nLike slant I didn't know what at the time to us if we can discuss this this creature was using as a methodology on me and had a message wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for the social call it wasn't passed them through with\nAnd I explained that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got I got bars on the windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in the house to descend lock them and jumped out do so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trespassing I couldn't see them so I go I turn the lights on in the basement and I go down to the basement\nAnd it's not looking everywhere\nYou you're pretty convince you see somebody in the house don't you\nOh absolutely absolutely but I\nThe only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel is menacing sinister I'm In is\nLike the only word to describe this like evil like an\nEvil just the name ...\nYeah I'm looking everywhere I look down to the steps and like any where somebody could squeezed himself into behind a washer and dryer in my son's room underneath his bed in his closet you know in the furnace who am I look I look at my frantic to look and I still have this horrible feeling [noise] so I'm thinking well\nI I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broke in but I still have this\nReally menacing sinister feeling that come upstairs and they sit down\nAnd I'm thinking about it and then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear\nThis wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and I hear something like really heavy because like I can hear when my wife

yesterday I did know\nKnow really neither one of you know oh my I received a mine worried I received my scared the heck out of me I was driving in my car and you know I mean there's no there's always scare me because they're not ready for it right and right now and then I thought you know I you know I even told myself oh it's going to go off year and a couple of minutes and then but uh\nYeah I'm Glad I was not in the grocery store when it happened because I feel like it would have been a little overwhelming with every one's right everyone ya authors yeah yeah but my my watch went off and my phone went off oh well yeah that was my watch went off while I was driving it'd be a little worried\nI Would I Would guess that just the important people got 'em and the fact that I didn't get him\nSo the only the people who really wants to save if it's a fan of the rest of us yeah there were just were expendable when it comes to that but um but\nI didn't know and then the guy the guy to actually be told me that uh apparently\nThere was a segment of the inner Web that blur social media that blew up ... talking about how well you know it was Adolf Hitler who told people they had to tune their radios to a certain frequency of time to hear his speeches\nAnd what better vehicle\nFor Donald Trump right get the word of oh you're a new\nOut there it was amazing how many people were so upset that Trump texted me yeah and I was like yes it says presidential alert but this is coming from FEMA and then the FCC and I mean yes and no other president has done this before but I think it might be a good thing to test it out and make sure it does work well\nAnd and and and that if there is a national emergency\nThat they're either way for people to get ... you know and again it hasn't happened before but you know cell phones you know obviously become more and more\nPrevalent every year or more and more people don't have landlines and only you know or don't listen to a to the radio anymore maybe don't watch a lot of TV so\nThey're like this is a great way for more than ...\nTail and health are you going to be alerted either by listening to the radio or watching TV writing something on TV but what if you're not around either one of the and I said\nYeah and again it's you know more people are listening to their own music more people are are not sitting in front of TV's anymore and so I I don't know it it didn't bother me at all\nWell the the the whole idea and we discussed that we mentioned it yesterday\nThe Obamacare rollout which was really really important was really really done poorly mhm and that's you know it's not on the Obama administration as much as just the government they just don't do things right ... to do a test run on this even see how close it is to work now\nObviously there's a little bit of failure because one out of three of us got the alerts so they're going to write something about that and I'm sure they wouldn't\nAgain that's it I mean that's a reason why they need to test these things because not everybody and you know you guys both have um I mean Scott your phone is really fairly new apple in mind you know so and they I mean and so I just don't understand why everyone was making such a big deal about it\nBecause they put anything having to do with Trump\n... yeah oh exactly Oh absolutely ... it's just because he's doing at your yeah

these days we'll get back on a normal ... but I was actually fly to the sea yesterday morning during our normal time gotcha which\nBrings up and it's you know if you go back in and look at it this is an interesting year I'm from July twenty six until now you'll have been in session ten days in the house that's a crazy short time\nWell it it it's actually a longer than that I have to go out I haven't counted it but it's been longer than add actually I think those are if you count the old days but I gather days at the end of the uh the beginning of the work week in the end of the work week it's actually been more and we do get things done in those days so\nUh it's it's probably again I'd have to go back and do the camp but it's over Fifteen sixteen days but\nThe idea is that sounds like you are not there and taking care of business and so what do you say that the that clean\nOut well let me say this I ever read reviews declaring\nA because all you have to do is look at the legislative activity that was conducted so we passed a to appropriations bills that fully funded the ... most of the government\nOr through the fiscal year ends September thirtieth of next year or the ... the twenty percent of the government that was at full funded on a full year by ISIS got done it at least until December and it was done without a lot of drama or we continue we passed in ... a bill\nA that's been signed by the president we passed an opioid bill that's been signed by the president\nOr you know the capital here he's been going on as well we we ... ... per duct tape\nWe passed a box of energy bills that came out of the\nHouse energy and Commerce Committee those were done voice basis bipartisan voice basis on the floor it's been remarkably productive if you look at this Congress a and look at what we've done over the time period that we've been in session since January twenty seven team\nWe passed a over three hundred and fifty bills have gone to prison for signature Ninety eight percent of those were bipartisan and edit dresses things like school safety opioids defense\nEnergy or the tax reform of course it's huge it's regulatory reforms it's been a very productive covers\nCongress for ... for joining us from a DC now of course a to point no past and I guess we need to make sure people understand that some of this uh goes through twenty twenty four having to do with ah some individuals and small business tax cut their in place but they are not permanent\nThat's correct unfortunately because of the way the Senate rules work of the Senate has cut the permitted um tax rates for families and small businesses to just to seven years\nThat was unfortunate and so what we've done in the house in tax reform to point out is to make those permanent um I expect that the Senate will be considering this bill sometimes a lame duck after the elections\nUp but you know ... the Senate was given away other things and the tax code and so it needed the money back so it it did it by shortening the time period for the tax cuts\nAre given the economic activity in the heart revenues that are coming in because of of the tax reform we now have the physical head room to make those family and business ... permanent\nNow what are the other things that are of course as we were discussing uh the the funding of the government the president was still looking for a wall so here we are on October the fourth what's what's the situation as far as the wall is concerned\nWell there are two things one is and the inappropriate appropriations bills we pass for fiscal year twenty Eighteen and also the one that was just signed by the press that\nA few days ago ... between those two we've got about three point two three point three million dollars for border security which includes a what he's calling the law which is really an integrated port security system\nAnd so we we buy really good down payments on those on uh on border security and everything it's not only just the physical barriers but it's also putting in the uh the technology systems and most importantly a the boots on the ground or border patrol\nNot surprisingly Canada finally in the last minute decided oh yeah I guess we do want to sign a deal with the United states for trade so how does the uh the new NAFTA I guess it's not even called NAFTA anymore he's changed the name of it ah how's that gonna affect Texas and district Seventeen\nWell let me say this that have been impacted huge ways number one is it takes away the uncertainty ah that was coming up during the the renegotiation\nOf NAFTA or as you know there was there was a lot of conjecture about whether or not what happened NAFTA or not and or any kind of a trade agreement and Texas is the biggest beneficiary\nOf cross border trade with Mexico ah\nAnd then out to a lesser extent also with Canada so the fact that we've got a new agreement takes a lot of that uncertainty off the table\nNow this agreement of Seventeen hundred pages long and I have not read all of it yet I've only read excerpts of it summaries I've got to dig through the rest of it during lots of October but all the stakeholders I talked to\nA seem to be pretty happy where folks and agriculture whether it's a automobile manufacturers even labor\nOr seems to be very pleased with his great my folks in the technology sector happy with the fact that it's now got digital provisions which didn't exist in the first after it's overall they it seems to be a pretty good agreement\nUh and and you know I I have to give credit to the president for standing his ground\nAnd and and and getting this thing pushed through the spot everybody that was trying to fight against him on it is I predicted when we talk to\nBut everybody that was trying to fight against him on it\nIs I predicted when we talked a couple of weeks ago I said Canada has to the table they cannot avoid being part of disagreement because we were of the world's largest market um and that you just you just can't exclude yourself from that so Canada I think saw through the emotional issues they were having them they signed up\nLast night to Mitch McConnell of filed I'm a pleasure closure so that's um that means that we finished talking about it it's time to vote that'll be the end of this week and I guess part of it is because there have been\nA a bunch of 'em\nInvestigations about cabinet prior to this that and I guess the the reason they were able to turn it around so quickly but now what does that do where do we think\nWell you know there are three Republicans that are a sort of on the fence about this about the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh at this point you've got the columns Murkowski in like\nI think they're going to be there at the FBI the seventh and best uh FBI investigation report that has been released this morning I think is going to show that there is no there there when it came to all the left wing antiques and claims and that\nThey ever more girlish charges that were levied against a Brett Kavanaugh I think it's got to show that there's nothing there and so the Senate ship forward and at the end of the day you get fifty Republican you're going to have two or three Democrats vote for it as well so hopefully by Saturday about lunchtime will have a new judge on the Supreme Court\nA group house conservatives is pushing for the house and Senate Ethics committees to launch investigations into Senator Feinstein a and others are about the leak of the letter or did you vote for that or did you call for that to happen or should there be any investigation about the\n... absolutely should be an investigation from all the activities that have happened related to this to the slander a judge cap at all\nI mean Feinstein's leaking ladder adult clued Sheila Jackson leaves office one night late one night docs are the three centers by releasing or personal information out it shouldn't included I mean I think in Canada I think we need to reopen the ah the stolen valor planes that Blumenthal\nAlso Cory bookers bragged about groping women when he was in college I think that needs to be investigated as well I think that was good enough\nTo slander a Brett Kavanaugh we need to look at everything related to the misbehavior of the Senate or an aunt Sheila Jackson leaves office\nA ... and related to this issue I mean if it's good enough for for you know a a cat is trying to get confirmed by the court it ought to be good enough for any elected officials\nAnd ... as a swamp continue to get deeper than no matter what did you get your

[laughter] now I mean ... million dollar um\nBut they have the right at least it's an issue that I can say okay I understand why they want this to happen\nI don't know why it's it's this guy cabinet he hasn't said that he's against roe v way to that he would try to overturn roe v Wade there is no case of roe v way but I at least I understand the argument really argument winter well we're not gonna stop 'em on that\nLet's stop him on all of this he tried to ... a girl a Fifteen year old when he was Seventeen and Nineteen eighty something\nNo cooperation no anything they couldn't stop him on his actual record they couldn't stop him on roe v Wade they couldn't stop him on soft money or by the way the left has a problem with soft money less it's coming from ...\nSo they couldn't stop him there\nLet me sit out there that we couldn't stop him on on the alleged rape either 'cause he's not a rapist\nI'm\nWell look at every responded do recall them a rapist in front of his wife and kids and he responded with a with a degree tone or the sarcastic tone\nThat he never needs to be on the court exactly\nRight doesn't have the temperament now so big lost an ever return so we know what's really happened we know the truth of the issues up till now simple question would is Amy Schumer or what our Amy Schumer and ...\nWhat question would is Amy Schumer or would already be Schumer and Emily say your name again or ...\nOr ... or early ... and ... and ... and ... Schumer a jar legitimately should use of Whoopi Goldberg she will be doing as I Would\nUse it that they are protesting if they say no rape is on the court carry I agree with them mhm who wants that right nobody said no abusers on the court I agree so what are they protested well according to ride to count is good yeah she\nWrote and I guess as of today today was arrested protesting the Supreme Court nomination Brett Kavanaugh a man who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault\nSo she she's protesting the fact that he's been accused of somebody who's been completely exonerated on by the FBI right\nIn seven deep profiles of his background you realize what he was with George W. Bush he literally had coached a nuclear weapon you're right yeah he literally had him\n\nThis this woman ... she's protesting the fact that the leftist said that he assaulted people and the FBI is no completely cleared him including the way for him to go to the court that's what she's protesting and that's what you got arrested over\nSo I go back to my first comments are they ... I mean there's just a complete void of intelligence here\nIs there a complete void of understanding anything that's going on this you really think that somebody who really raped people are abused people is going to be put on the on the Supreme Court well here's here's another stream side that has been shamed the FBI is always writing Trump is rude or something Mm\nMm maybe yeah well the FBI just decided\nI don't know the question was where to break this down was an actual member of the Senate Judiciary committee Senator John Cornyn Republican the great state of Texas you will not want to miss this a pretty good detail here that you might not know people who drove had Joe\nLook a Corey I I can hate the sin but loved the center but I think he's just been ridiculous in this process not only the I Am Spartacus moment but saying he was intentionally going to violate the rules of the Judiciary Committee and make confidential documents public because he didn't agree with it right\nUnfortunately I think this is the kind of what he and others who are running for president twenty twenty or responding to is this sort of unhinged anger and not only at the Trump Administration but um that are making our politics so polarizing\nIt is a Senator John Cornyn Republican the great state of Texas of course in the Senate Judiciary committee that that just passed Kevin ... onto the full Senate for a vote there was some sort of a hesitation by by Senator Jeff flake which was another odd moment that not withstanding it looks like he's probably going to be confirmed\nThat what about his family does anybody care about this guy's family he's got a beautiful wife and daughters he's got an exemplary record in the community he goes to church every Sunday to ease the coach of the girl soccer team I don't think you could you could have written a movie script with a better candidate for the Supreme Court but now for ever and some people who are indoctrinated on the far left senator\nThey believe this guy's a serial rapists some how how did you get his reputation back how does this family get through this\nWell it's it's really it's just a it's unacceptable and uh and it just really violates every fundamental notion of fairness we have in this country when people are accused of things like this or no presumption of guilt in fact the presumption of innocence due process to a right to a fair\nA fair hearing and so um I think he is a thankfully are willing to endure this terrible process despite the pain or that it's caused the unfairness to him and his family because I think he realizes that if the word to withdraw that this\nStain caused by these allegations would following the rest of his life\nAnd so I'm proud of him for being willing to up to fight back there's some now suggesting I guess because of run out of other arguments that his self defense at the second the hearing shows that lack of judicial temperament\nBut I I think it was a display of righteous anger at the way that he's been mistreated and the way Dr Ford's been mistreated by by uh by the process\nI thought that was very very smart and very sympathetic view earlier and you said just consistently that the left actually took advantage of Dr Ford how do you want to lose big anonymous Dianne Feinstein the ranking member on that committee\nPurposely settled in this letter for almost two months somebody leak didn't only few people had it including Deborah attach a far left resistance warrior that somehow was on a lousy forwards team\nUm they leaked it they somehow got this out there what should Feinstein have done in your opinion ... maybe maybe not even come into her if you will and save and you get that same letter John what do you do with it\nWell Brett Kavanaugh's since Nineteen Ninety three has been through um a ... seven\nBackground investigations by the FBI so they've talked to a hundred and fifty witnesses to determine what his fitness in his background are right or for this job and what should have happened is when this letter was gotten it should've been sent to the FBI so they could pursue it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "College Station", "day": "04"}
