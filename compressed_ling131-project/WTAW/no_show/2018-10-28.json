of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with the down payment now in our first hour we talked about new research from the Urban Institute\nAbout barriers to homeownership and how coming up with that down payment is so frightening to some people\nThey don't even try to buy a house but those fears are largely unfounded because sure some people are not ready to buy but many who are\nThey think they need more money than they really do and amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably has down payment assistance programs ready willing and able to help homebuyers get into that house\nLet's talk about that now joining us once again is Rob crane what the organization down payment resource Rob launched downpayment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties with hard to find a down payment programs Rob thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's great to be with you again okay so Rob let's talk about those down payment assistance programs\nFirst of all it's not just for first time buyers every time correct\nCorrect and I say that for two reasons one is that\nPart of that is because the definition that's normally used for first time homebuyer is that you have an on the on the last three years so you could about over the past and\nNot old home for three years and for these purposes is the first time homebuyer requirement also there are in our database probably about thirty six percent of the programs do at any first time homebuyer required\nInteresting and another thing Rob about downpayment assistance programs you don't have to necessarily have a starter wage to qualify I understand that people can actually be making a really good amount of money and still get the assistance\nThat's absolutely correct a lot of it has to do with\nWhere you live because they are ... household income limits on these programs they not only in the area from program the program\nBut they vary from state to state city to city region to region so if you live in high cost areas the area and median income is like the higher than low cost areas so depending on where you live\nYou might be able to make over a hundred thousand dollars in your household and still qualify for a lot of these programs\nThat is amazing so Rob how to our listeners learn more about downpayment resource and the down payment help that might be available to them\nBut they can go to the down payment resource dot com and ... button that says find programs and to her about six or eight pieces of information about the household\nAnd then assess the hotel how many programs eligible for and uh about those programs at where to find the money of support like right by the ... over money\nYou better pass to get there and and the system and that they'll tell them not only where the where where to find the money or the participating lenders participating education spiders and so forth\nI see so Rob let me back up just

really important when you're looking for a home to find a lender as either ... or you go out looking for actually that that's the first step because you don't want to get excited about trying to

right so in for George Nouri tonight who's getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... in in this period just before Halloween that is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night looking forward to a season\nWith the which it's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUm we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James\n... so have you better know as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had um scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out\nHe wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like you know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff up it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nOn coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll say some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed uh it was a great game\nAnd I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire\nYou know I'm not saying Larry King a vampire but I was looking at him behind home plate and I'm just saying this um he may not be a vampire but long after\nI'm dead Larry King will be onto a wife number not with another round of kids and still be home plate\n[noise] I think it's very real uh in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net\nA business that says the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch the you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with the brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\n[noise] and the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which I'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so\nOne of the things that have on mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosque is for seeing\nIs the day when we ... with the use of one of these men are on that\nWe can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a keyboard or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts on to a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon is so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so usually usually a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a a a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nTalk about that tonight we will I I\nBecoming very realistic we can talk about that tonight we will I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic second cryogenic is the kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it will be but I think the other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said too much of it I think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when they see\nThe future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nCouldn't go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh I Know absolutely\nAnd and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in to some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about high in the sky one you know the sweet bind by one day\nNow these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... they we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence that we have the ability to manipulate DNA now\nAt will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's been since ... right now it's it's crazy\nWell in ... I'm reminded of the of the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla\nAnd ... and the the the I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by\nA a publishing company which is known for being state based and ... and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion\nOf not just doing things because we can but because we should do and the officer really important in there to show you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give them credited with their idea um and you know they said basically you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history because of the lessons it teaches us about\nWhat we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you can are reporting science to all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe\nOur perfect base in their ...\nIt's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew ... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand but now if you can imagine\nOh no it's I mean I've read through to you you're very young this is very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are really in\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into the wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I like the five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I had become a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my my faith very very seriously and so when I say\nWe need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets a basis them there are some innovations in this book that I think\nWe need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go with the next ditch the classic study so much so that the pope rodents fetus at ... on it just because we can should we will find out what's on Michael ... list next on coast to coast am excuse me in on it [noise]\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like whether that was due uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something\nYou know even that it makes me question whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\nYeah I agree with you in and uh I think in another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example\nThere is such a good way in California right as a company in California that\nIs um marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration under eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff cause you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most shirts so a lot of this technology that that ... aims at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality\nIs going to be available to the super rich and so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm\nAble to to benefit from this and and the others that you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about it in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of different franchise\nUm or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know there's enough is enough I mean we're we're taking in the we're taking it as a behind\nAnd and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting when I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem no use in that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nWell I figured it's a late night show so\nI Try and she's going to lay down on that one okay asleep\nBut you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know tied that what you said what but uh\n[laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling book out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world on the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again\nBut one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape for this serious thing I Hope some\nI quote former Google engineers in a Google executive or a ... and others who say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanged goes ... ... ... ... ... ... because yeah the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophy\nRight it was ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that believe that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point I\nI'm thinking about I'm reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park\nWhen he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could\nYou know a quantify society it the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them\nAnd then if that becomes the ... the clash that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance to do it it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah\nFrom the east you will time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no ... it's interesting ah by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jet Blue and was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or way it's\nJust not just a job and you know he has though [laughter] I was at ... this appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at college right now you know [laughter] but no job for him\nBut yeah it's in ... I ... I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance\nIt's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed doing work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know a a you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um\n... what what we learn is that ah these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that didn't that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clarke once said and it stuck with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't even know how long\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by half\nWith the staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it well\nAnd here's an age now let me raise up a little differently yeah there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out no actually they were killed off\nAs opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow the evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nYou know the fact that they you know some giant bird in New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off three days and so um you know there's going so I mean I I realize you could make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that barren brought him back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nUm but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we start making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be that's when I think you'd get super well do you use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ... becomes dumb writes scary because who is going to be making these decisions\nOnce that technology becomes more facile\n[noise] yeah yeah you're you're you're raising a good point you know I Do talk about of these the extinction efforts that are going on right now I'm that primarily focused on the woolly mammoth\nAnd I I remember when I was at ABC News I was actually invited to come to Russia where there there there were a group of scientists I think the French guy was in charge of the group as I recall and\n\nPlenty of sun today pleasantly low humidity with temperatures in the lower the mid eighties this afternoon clear skies overnight pleasant Tempe just falling back to the low sixties lots

excellent timing and and you know this is a Grammy Award winning ... they are just gorgeous\nWhen they were here before I remember thinking that colors and the ... were on this more than you can take satisfied the sound and they start singing\nYeah they they do filled the room with sound and if you're sitting up up front you might want to wear sunglasses because it's a little brighter\nThey're just gorgeous there it's joyful young gosh we need a little Joe I doubt\nWe ... a little that would be kinda nice I'm looking at the uh the promotional play bill here and it says the gospel choir they performed with a bunch of folks traveling the world you to Aretha Franklin Stevie Wonder Robert Plant\nCeline Dion the red hot chili peppers Peter Gabriel Josh Groban et cetera et cetera and they're coming here I assume you've seen these folks other than just the ten year ago performance\nI Know now okay here is the only place that same\nOkay how many folks were anticipating to be on the stage wild guess\nUh you know I Want to say probably thirty five to fifty I don't know exactly how many that at least thirty five\nWell and this of course is happening I say of course not having said it before but it's on Tuesday the thirty of October seven thirty PM and writer auditorium and plenty of good seats are still available\nPlenty of good seats are available this one out of course this is off the season so you had to buy extra right and that's the good news and the bad news is that what that means is that there are seats available in every sound is to you know our subscribers have taken at all gather Indians\nAnd downloading up close or not all gun in his case problem so that possibly exist solely selling\nWell and it's picking up now that the ads started to it on TV or if you aren't familiar with the ... go on our website at ... dot org and watch a video\nAnd that is we talked about as before one of the great things you guys who is you put those samples videos on there

at him and we're at ... dot edu\nWe join you again next Sunday morning right here on sixteen twenty W W for breakfast arts on market which [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWould you wonder why we're so committed to the community remember we're the only locally owned media and be see us and we think it matters WG a W College Station Bryan\nAt you know what a dot com presenting the world's worst boss but one of those jobs don't you just do jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a date\nYou make things beautiful and she does she makes things beautiful there are listeners right now who are hearing you describe your home and is it wrong to want to make things beautiful to make a home are appealing to the\nIt's not I don't think it's wrong at all I think the problem comes with our heart with regards\nIt gets thrown at all I think the problem comes with our heart with regards to it in my heart was that I couldn't be happy without it\nI literally could not walk out of the store if I saw something and appeal to me a no power over that it didn't matter if my bank account was overdrawn and didn't I had to have that so the way that we worship the stuff is what's important is what the problem\nIt's almost like when if people have an opportunity to come over to the house and if ... if that's a roadblock like in my family my mother would not\nAllow us to bring friends over we wouldn't have people over to the house if the house was looking good\nIf it wasn't clean like a well it was a mess we can now we just can't and and so when when the appearance of things or the condition of things where we don't have a nice enough car for us to participate in the car pool\nThat's where it becomes it becomes paleo alluded to it becomes a matter of worship and the lessons for the new more\nIt's not just stuff it can be activities it can be friendships that can be followers on Twitter or friends on Facebook I Need\nMore and more and I just have to ask you this target temple worship that we've been talking about here was this after he got married or before he got married\nWell I ended up and twenty thousand dollars worth of debt when I was in right after college and that wasn't college debt that was just credit card debt and I wasn't married at the time and so it was just it was the way that I find myself\nBut did you start confronting this started confronting it after I got married after you got one so so basically you're bringing debts and and the problem in to this joint relationship\nGotten rid of the debt by then but I brought in to worship I bought an English and it still exist I mean there are still times when I say I really want to have my friends over\nBut the houses just a mess and Michael ... are you kidding me have we not\nWork through this this house is the way it looks is not more important than community and then fellowship and your friends love you regardless of how slicks and that's hard for me to overcome and I have to hear from him regularly otherwise I can become consumed with how beautiful everything looks\nAnd so our practically have you dealt with this this idol back before Easter lent I actually faster during limp from certain things and it was healthy for me to do that because I gave up things that I thought were becoming too important to me that's good okay\nDo you fast from target yeah [laughter]\nYeah well I I did more than that I mean it was\nA few years ago when we started to confront this idea and we I took a entire year off from buying anything new\nExcept food I went to good well if we needed anything and I and so I took a year off from target I couldn't even go in at first I tried to go and it was no cash but I had credit card so did that you're you know I didn't know I don't I Try really right now we're going through the process of daily giving away three things today myself and my daughter\nWe go through the house and say let's give away three things day just to keep our minds and that in that idea that this is an important if you can't give away some stuff and something's wrong like what what are you giving away well I started with my closet started giving away close that's easiest because they're just everywhere and right now I've had this is not torture signs of giving my books\nOkay so right now there's a listener who downloaded the the broadcast on their their iPhones or their high pod and they're walking through\nTarget ruined it for what is your advice back what is your [laughter]\nMcCotter\n\nOr now you know sometimes on the side I put on a red polo [laughter] am I going to have very amorous [laughter]\nWhat's\nYour advice to that woman\nI ... I hate to say because they're just going to scream at me but my advice is stop and ask yourself why do I want this what is my motivation behind it and if it isn't so that you can serve God better to pay back\nBecause really the chief in demand is to glorify God is this stuff and you're cutting to glorify him it might be something your kids need for school that's part of your ministry that's part of your door and God but if it's not then is it meant to glorify you\nIt it sounds to me a little bit like this dying to stuff thing is not making you happier do do you know what I'm saying I mean as you're expressing it this sounds hard this sounds unpleasant is their joy and peace and hope mhm in what you're doing\nYes there is relief in it I think that for a lot of the stuff becomes a bird and even though it's a joyful when you're shopping for it you get it home that becomes a burden\nThe relief from that is is found in just the letting go just like when I'm an argument as Michael\nIf I hold onto that it feels good to get back at him and to show him how I'm right 'cause that does feel better it's quicker path right at the end result will be more suffering because it will compound it just it builds more and more animosity between us it's the same with stuff the more I buy stuff the more it builds\nThis feeling of just an ... an overwhelming I'm too busy there's too much to do there's too much going on in my life and how many women complain about that\nIf we can just let go of the staff meaning not just the physical things that are calendar is filled with stuff\nI'm too busy to introduce you to go play with my kids are even to play with my husband got too much to do does that feel have like happiness it doesn't that letting it go and letting a simple life in all those areas you will find great piece and great feed him [noise]\nWhat a great reminder from Hailey demarco you know the stuff that we have can burden us down and I'm In the process right now of\nMoving homes and packing up everything and go I can I tell you that stuff can burden you down it almost makes me wish that I could pack up just the essentials in my small SUV and just drive away\nA great reminder of just the simple life and that reminds me of something that my friend hand Anderson spoke about in a recent family life today broadcast she was talking about her book humble roots\nIn in that book she shares about Jesus and when Jesus was talking about take my yoga upon you because my yolk is easy in my burden is light\nAnd we have a link to that broadcast on our website

I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgrace fully turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist songs and talking about how they're going to transform English us in the U.S and Germany damage to me that people are mixing up the Jewish refugees in Germany with the German American but you know\nThese people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by their governments there they're just living in kind of crappy countries you know and those countries are crappy for a reason\nFor historical and cultural and political reasons because it\nTrees are crappy for a reason uh for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad\nDictatorial political culture from Spain uh whereas we inherited a kind of anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England\nAnd as a result they have worse government's worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great\nLatin American economists her ... her and I think his name is ... ... a ... ...

... right now there are so many people who are allowing their political passions to swallow up everything else in their lives\nThat they're thinking it's normal to just scream of people at a restaurant throw their food on the table there's not a question about whether or not your First Amendment rights allow you to protest they certainly do but America starts with a fundamental assumptions about what the good life is and we don't think that power is the end power as a means to maintain order so that people can have\nDinnertime discussion and debate with family and friends that even people that don't agree with on everything\nBut shutting people down in a restaurant and throwing their food on the floor or or doing what folks that diplomacy is I think we're headed to a

shared understanding across three hundred twenty billion up out\nOf the bowl but in which we're living both in media consumption and media baby as a subset of technology more broadly I think the big tension and our bowl but that would be useful for us to reflect on it and a lot of why I wrote the book them is the tension between ruthlessness and rudeness\nOr happiness literature is showing us something that you know sort of thoughtful people and\nGet people who have grandparents that older wisdom in their life has probably known for millennia but there are about four things that Dr happiness you have a nuclear family you have a couple of deep friendships yeah meaningful work shirt vocation and co workers and do you have a local worshipping community\nThose four ingredients are basically what Dr whether or not but they are happy that's all the all that stuff is about ... and our technology is allowing us to start to think of ourselves as completely ruthless and the way that we're consuming media and the way that we're thinking about political tribalism is a function of that sort of the of the mindset you're right there\nI'm sure you read David Brooks his column the rich white civil war last week based on the hidden tribes study and it is in fact not a problem of the center is a problem of the extremes on the left and right\nNow the cuts that we want to catapult abused at each other but it's also one that is powered by anonymity and I'm Wondering senators asked what do you think of a none of his comments and the tenor they bring to our politics\nYeah great great flags on both points first of all I think that the study of refer to hit tribes is great every your listeners should go read it or David Brooks peace in the near ... early last week was one of the ... of it\nAnd one of the things that he says that so really it is when you take apart so these demographers and social scientists tried to look at America and figure out where are we on politics and so often we just think of it is right versus laughed\nBut there is another dimension which is intensity of thinking that politics should crowd out the rest of life on the second or third most conservative voter in the U.S Senate but I'm a huge skeptical about the idea that you can put politics at the center of your life and actually live well and love your neighbor well\nAnd what what Brooks black was two of the seven tribes that are identified in that study hidden Dr\nTwo of the stuff that are most politically at ... or the eight percent on the far left the pay constant attention to politics\nThat are rich and white and the six percent on the far right the pay constant attention to politics the rich and white and eighty six percent of America is saying go away you people are weird\nPolitics is a means to an end so that I can coach little league and live in my local community and decide that politics should crowd everything else out it's it's wrong or it's never been an American I yeah and right now a huge part of what we are going through um is that fourteen percent telling the eighty six percent\nYou're weird that you want to live in communities the eighty six

ask you a day at the outset ... your piece was actually scary and sad and very honest how how many years did you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nMe it's hard to gauge how many years actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades\nAnd I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it so a long time how do you know you over did it\nNow that I'm Silber I can look back on some of the mighty have years when I was high and and realize that that pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public meltdown even temper tantrums even uh\nI was having a public meltdowns even temper tantrums even uh getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also wasn't sleeping normally and and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time\nThinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume mad about it with the consumers with about trips I could take that revolve around marijuana and you know it just kind of became the center of my life for a very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you you've been married for a while right\nNow I've been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I'd be\nPublished does got published ten bucks\nI had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for you know pretty much every English language publication ... except for the New Yorker you know it it's not like I I was a um an on ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I certainly would have a you know live my life with more integrity and and carried out my ah my business affairs with what made it more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nHow long how long have you been sober\nMy one year anniversary is November of levels\nAnd what advantages do you see now that you're not smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of or go to ... because\nIn some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote almost all my books I all the time and I I Can't although in retrospect there there's a law that there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting high I think there'd be fewer of those but you know it it it helped me come up with certain like fancy indecent jokes\nAnd he was a creative stimulant subways\nBut uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but\nEverything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't there is not as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows\nThat was happening when I was using marijuana so I'm not having those melt down that would characterize\nA sort of my my addiction cycle\n[noise] yeah one thing you you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years did your wife never share a year and says he asked him for a lead\nNo in fact you know she doesn't see the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all\nUm and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem it was just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know because the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive it in some ways it's considered a health food um and\nSo I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and my family\nUm and obviously have the addiction

for them to call you well\nFor instance someone is thinking about\nGoing are being full time they have\nOf personal items in there\nOver time they're going to take some of them with\nTo basically liquidate their arms so they can sell it\nGet on the road and and a turn the page in our life open up another chapter we would help\nWith that we do stay liquid day shift so we can be helpful there\nMostly we deal with a lot of seniors who have lived in their homes you know could be two three four\nThousand square foot homes that are receiving an assisted living or independent living circumstances and\nWe can help them with the things that they're bringing the things that they want to liquidate the things they want to do\nMembers we can help them throughout the whole cost some\nPeople might say well what makes you different than a moving company and what would you say that Rick\nWhat makes this different from a typical moving company is we just don't go\nTaken to their you know we are from the beginning of the process we go and meet with\nThe the things that they\nOne of the things that they want to take with\nThem the things that they want to be in whatever way they want what we help them\nBasically they call us than we do an assessment weekend\nOn the financial side of things like one of those items we use online\nOptions quieter failed state sales so insane to think full\nCircle if you will process and you know I'm just come in like boxers are we to another place we pack\nIn between are covered and\nThat they're already too costly sell their home up they watch or whatever\nThey choose your service meaning we start to finish and when you have\nPeople who are trained in a caregiving that for many many years and so that special extra care for those who need it and seniors especially with the stress and chaos and the humor like the stay really appreciate families really increased\nUs and making movies like the stay really appreciate them down families really appreciate what we do for him in\nProcess oh yeah it's a very stressful time to move and I think as you age ... and if your downsizing or moving across the country you're pretty concerned about your stop this isn't a typical move across town when you're in the middle of your life and you have\nLots of things to think about with so many seniors they're packing up their memories right or green and\nOf the challenges that you really have to be sensitive to things that people have memories us you know it's it's not just about selling something that somebody doesn't want any more there's memories attached to a lot of things and sometimes those things are not able to live with them to their to where they're\nSo that has to be handled with with special care one point that you brought up\nYou know moving across the country and all the good thing about what we do [laughter] caring transitions as we have over two hundred\nTransitions franchise they're located all across the United states and we were able to work with let's say a company in Detroit or on the east coast west coast wherever you know if there is an office that is you know relatively local to them were able to a partner with them\nAnd take care of our our customers both\nWhen they get here wonderful so if you're in another place do you actually packed the boxes or or do our seniors get to pack here things or is it a combination of both read well\nDon't park package okay\nDidn't you know some of our seniors are clients they will choose to be on site with us for some of them will start the process of\nMonths earlier and works things that are going to be going with\nAre going to be donated and uh basically in that case they don't\nTo be on site\nDays we have everything taken care of and\nOn to their new your place of course if it was out\nOr out of state that would be a little different but for the most part we do all the the packing\nSo we're the ones that know where things go obviously our clients if they feel more comfortable in their\nBeing there and say no I Want this year they're\nSo we're looking at collections if we happen to downsize we may not be able to take all of our collections with us how you help us sell those you said you have on line tell me a little bit about how to sell our collectibles that we think so my job\nWhen we do our assessment when we do a one hour free consultation and\nWe make an assessment and if somebody says well\nThis collection\nFiguring it depends on what those figuring as our summer obviously very valuable in any more to it and then some\nNot as much what we'll do is make that assessment\nIf it's a very valuable\nWhat we'll do is we will try to put another dollar\nThe overall value of whether the online\nAuction process would be best or to sell it to a private cell or maybe that specializes in those\nThose types of items so we surely don't want to sell our clients\nShort um we always want to get\nBasically the on\nThat we sell our items that\nMost of the time I should say but they're also be online auction process allows people buyers to bid against each other or for specific items and may\nAs high of a\nAs you would go to a specific fire who say five silver so\nAnd you can help us with all that yes oh yeah we we help\nTedious process there is a research that sometimes is involved we do have contacts for doubt many industries and our staff\nQuite a bit of training and experience and\nThe best places to take him to to get the most for crimes\nGot it got it so Riggins if we're planning to move in the near future we knew we contact carrying transition to come out in and give us an estimate\nWell the best of the time\nBetter although on short notice we can definitely accommodate\nYou're looking say to lose in November for me to sixty days is is a would be a good lead time\nBut you know we have had people call center\nAnd if upon our availability if we can do it will definitely try to accommodate but the sooner the\nSome people are very organized\nThings in place and we've done console patients a year in advance\nSo it really just\nOn the person's situation and\nCan we do our best to accommodate\nUsually takes you know two days to perform the packing\nBad is unpacking so within three or four days on a on a local birds so it can be done relatively quickly of course when you bring in the online\nEstate sale things like that that takes a little bit more time because we have a staff that comes in and basically assesses and uh what we call ... and then put that on\nThe bidding goes on and so that's kind of a little longer process you're looking there\nAbout two to three weeks on average sometimes a little quicker sometimes a little more depending on the complexity of the a job in the amount of items\nOkay so really the sooner the better but sooner the better\n[laughter] yeah yeah that that does the innocent people are planners\nAnd then live has a way of sometimes messing up our plans and we have to rally and get into high gear and and\nI just wondered how long it intends for that 'cause you know not always do we know ahead of time what's going on in our lives and when we're going to need you so I appreciate that how do we get a hold of carrying transition drinkers had been appointed\nNumber is ... area code nine seven nine\nZero five to zero\nKeep you off track and they're not condemning there's certainly by no means you know putting built on the individual frankly\nHelping in a positive reinforcing way just stay on track and fulfill look goals that they themselves want to achieve and and that's really the key factor here\nThat we were not imposing the will of health plans on an uninsured people were joining us on a three will basis voluntarily\nCooperatively knowing they need to make life change hadn't been able to accomplish it before but find this methodology compatible\nAnd reinforcing and frankly white transforming\nWell sure I mean it's going to give them over living longer than ever\nAnd I think most of the health issues we bring on ourselves with what's going on all we've got new ourselves in our lives will\nThe CDC recently put out some statistics which are us that there are essentially three conditions that really produce most eighty percent\nOf our entire health care spend in America and its type two diabetes and heart disease and cancer forty percent of that cancer they say is due to lifestyle choices smoking particularly\nRight we have oh it's a Spanish it costs of health care or in our hands that we make those choices and decisions and that's why we are just so thrilled to mobilize together as a community being held conscience and health aware not always healthy but I Am back\nHalf way to change how does\nAs far as people sharing our medical bills well last stills and they can go to help more people if we lower our own health care cost\nPrice when he said oh in fact it's a three legged stool ... number one as we've talked our health conscious and aware any taking care of our health\nAnd being a health\nConscious and aware and reducing bows cost and that's the natural outflow of that shared value it comes\nFrom that whole war because we really have a spiritual or moral obligation to care for our health and so the outcome obviously is reduced cost the other part of that a ... is

Jason how do I know what kind of liberty\nAnd most people aren't going to get too wrapped up in that that's not the pretty stuff right but you know it's a it's in the last you may have one builder he's saving you some money but he's using a grade three lumber which nobody would want to put in their house but they don't know it\nI don't know that what what grade should I be looking for a grade to okay for your frame and materials okay so if we got an offer or a bed or a proposal from somebody we can bring it to you and say translate this until language we understand right and how does this compare to what you offer right\nWell and it's it's important because often you know most clients don't know all the nitty gritty details of all the building specs but they can sit down with somebody a builder and say okay well you know we've got radium Barry sheeting here on your roof where this one doesn't you know we've included\nInsulation yeah I don't know anything about it\nNow there's tons of inflation there's a big difference in cost so it's important to know again you know we're putting in bad insulation was blowing fiberglass or we do in a bid system we're doing phone I mean there is among your speaking\nPortuguese to me now I have no idea\nBut you know when you're getting these bids that's why it's so important to get all the specifics okay 'cause you know you can just say well this guy said he can build a for a hundred and thirty a foot but you're at a hundred and fifty why well let's\nLet's look at what is reflecting end writer so it can be the insulation it could be that would it could be that slab that could be roofing materials that can be everything and we\nTalked to one another segment about allowances you know that's one of the areas that uh if you traditionally if you find a bed where everything seems to be the same if you start digging in the allowance is you're going to see that hey this allowance really is and get us the way high all that we like fries are going to get us the would we like when we come shopping for plumbing fixtures\nWe're not going to have many choices right right okay so\nIt's very very important to get the specifics and uh I Would work with a builder that uh is going to divulge as much of that information as he can so that you have something to compare it\nTo this is not the part that shouldn't be a secret no okay so you're like me you want full disclosure he we will explain to them people send me I'm comparisons all the time and they say well your taxes are higher your insurance is higher like well actually that's not that's a non issue because the taxes are going to be what the taxes are\nThe insurance we're going to be whatever the insurance company quote you in whichever one you take\nAll I don't have control over a lot of those numbers just like you don't write the lumber is with the lumber is going to be\nThe lumber crosses gonna fluctuate based upon the market and that's out of control but what is important as what type of lumber that we're using okay and you know are we building to certain code you know you get out in the rural areas where they don't have a inspectors from units penalties than you know it'd be easy to use a something different different specs\nOK okay how and so you can do that and as our cost of that to have you come in and look at a proposal against themselves you\nKnow all the you know coming up with an estimate is no cost to our clients and we're more than happy to sit down we don't often have clients bringing other bids from from builders but sometimes they do and we can sit down and talk to them and explain to him the differences\nAnd I feel like most of our clients walk away from that feeling it was a beneficial rise there's just a lot that don't know I mean they're good at whatever their profession is this is our profession let us help you decipher what these beds including what they don't include so you can go back to these builders and get some clarification\nI think too that people are looking at building a home versus buying a home that's already built\nThat's like apples and elephants they're not even in the same category are they right right\nThere's too much goes into it when you buy a house you buy a house with a price tag on it because all those things are already taken into consideration to list price that house and when you're building house it's much more pliable yeah I really don't know how to follow that well because well I just said that that that's the way it does work right I mean once you they say can you build a house for this\nWell you don't know because you haven't factored in all those things so it really takes some time to this is going to be an appointment that's going to last a couple of hours\nOh sure yeah we're talking about kind of starting from scratch and whatever you want to put in and we're going to have a bunch of questions that you probably have not thought of that process doesn't exist when you're just going out and buy an existing home\nYou're taking it as it is sure do you have people that come in from other parts of that and I guess community or maybe from Houston or Dallas and you build for them and they're not familiar with south with tons what would you tell them about your company give us some history and background behind\nOn southwest homes was started in Nineteen eighty four and Brian actually in our current location a bunny may\nName Roger Williams uh so he had been building this community for Thirty years before I took over 'em and they primarily a focus\nOut in the rural areas building on people's property okay a all custom home building we don't haven't done any spec home building so okay you know that's that's kind of been our history that's where we exist as is out there in in that area\nDo you have people relocating here from other cities and I guess you see a moving back as much as ... as much as I Do\nOur other cities and other states in fact we have a lady who just came down from Alaska her where things are being shut down over the next two weeks but she actually built her house from Alaska I think she's seen it a total of two maybe three times how did you do that well we've got to\nA fantastic online program where our customers have a portal so she can go and she can see video she can see pictures\nOf course you know ... of our house being built so we involve her as much as we possibly can even though she's in Alaska\nNice so how long did that process take did you buy the land for her out for pick it out or she already has a land\nNo she had the land and we went out and and looked at it and we shot grades and talked about location and exactly how the house is going to sit relative to the exposures and so did all that process and really spent a few days going through picking out everything\nHow did you pick out stuff from Alaska\nOr most or everything she picked out while she was here before the house even get started now say things that we were able to ah just send her emails pictures and then of course there is some vendors up there that she could go in and see like products\nI'm just a few chapters just detailing step by step what to do the home the most important things are those first impressions take her loan to take care of the wheat eating the ages make sure the grass\nIs trimmed make sure that Bush is a nice and neat\nAllow or is not de la ... right in a dead hand not feeling everything needs to be a huh like ready for pictures\nJust simple simple things um outdoor lighting you could just even putting up a new ... but most people will walk across the front porch and never see that it means clean them run into the store and picking up a cheap power Russia for a hundred bucks and spending the afternoon cleaning off the front porch and clean them off the ... the walkway to the home\nEven though it doesn't look dirty to you by the time it's clean it'll look fantastic in a really popping those pictures and then the video that we want to come in and take of the house\nGot it ... you um have a way of putting his stuff on the MLS and you're going to put the videos up on your website mhm and in certain price range of the house and go very fast than other price ranges that that's going to be a little bit it's going to be a normal turn time to sell a house\nYeah and the I think right now is a February's market report was the last one we got out the average um the average time a market was right around Ninety Days\nAnd then the average time from officer closes about sixty days ... still with a very fast market and the very competitive market is still taking about five months from start to finish of the transaction\nWhen when you go way when you when you do a transaction with Mitt fairway uh-huh we have four hours of underwriting which used to take two or three days now we have a four hour turnaround we also can close within two and a half weeks\nSo bill there you're pretty far short and if you wanted our on that little length of time to just call 'cause we have to go by the contract so if you're crazy and you decide you're in a clause in three weeks I\nHave to honor that or I give you five hundred dollars you're buyers and sellers\nSo and I don't get the ... you don't get five hundred they do um but I but I stand by what you write so on you can't go too crazy on me but if we can get it done in two or three weeks\nI'm we abide by all those closing days so they don't have to take as long as what people want and then he of course if you want to write for a home and you're in that early price range that first time homebuyer pride range\nOr they're going to want a fast closing they're not going to want to sixty a forty five day drawn out they want to get in and get out of the market\nAnd that's where I was a ... the agents really need to educate the ... was asked to getting pre qualified I'm pre approved before the off a procedure stops\nIdeally they're going to want to come and talk to me before that happens absolutely that I can look at their tax returns or W. twos\nAnd I can say Sam they're good at tennis price range\nAnd I'll get you a pre approval letter I can we got an app called fair way now and I can send you that happened you can then send it out to your\nLevel that you work with um I can send a pre approval letter from my phone so I can be anywhere I don't want to go to an office I don't have to wait to get back to a computer once they're in the system and they're in my computer system at the office I have access from my phone I can send you a letter out and if you make three hours on three different houses\nBoom boom boom you're going to have three different letters all within minutes\nYou heard

[noise]\n\nRight now it's time for armed American radios daily defense with the most Walter back inside the armed American radio daily defense studios with mark office that would be me\nWelcome back let's go right back to anti Hoosier the voice of reason cake you am Wichita big talker and our great armed American radio daily defense and monster cast affiliate Andy welcome back let me tell you what I said yesterday when I was talking\nOn a on in the opening segment you know I hate the media I hate them know what they're up to I Know how they operate and I know how they do what they do\nKnow what it means I Know what a lie of omission is just one hour ago well before I go there let me finish quickly\nA lot of this this hatred in America comes right smack from the media itself for pushing\nNow Ninety two percent that's a Harvard study Ninety two percent of of the coverage on Trump\nIs horrific all negative\nTurn on CNN watch CNN all day long put on Don Lemon lectured by that clown okay put on Cuomo get lectured by that cloud put on M. S. DNC get lectured by those clowns all day long it's bash bash bash bash back and it's a twenty four hour dose of this crap\nAnd of course people are starts though when you had people begin thinking that watching Rachel Maddow house you crap at Trump is news it's not news\nIt's no more news and Sean Hannity is in charge a friend of mine it's not news Sean his opinion\nPeople watch it they they think they're watching Fox and friends they think they're watching the news they think they're watching NBC today they think they're watching the news yesterday we William some Sarasota Herald Tribune said it better than I could've ever said it is it any show that cuts away from a couch to cook something isn't a new show it's entertainment\nAnd it mass grades as news Andy ... and I think you know that\nNo lie of omission we talk about it a lot and I know you and I have discussed it as well where the press becomes very dangerous is not just in what they tell you what the intentionally don't tell you would you agree with that\nOh absolutely okay\nYou know there's a one hour ago one hour ago Fox has a piece of NBC News raises eyebrows by sitting on info contradicted Michael ... clients gang rape claim on Capitol they sat on it because they didn't want you to hear it this was one hour ago\nWhat else are they sitting on Andy that they don't want us to know\nA great question I mean it it it's something to think about when it comes to maybe the polling they did a poll and we didn't get the answer we want gets we're not gonna report that one because of the show that the blue waves going to happen\nMaybe it's not all when it comes to individuals\nThat like the second amendment maybe it's maybe it's a story about an actual shooting it when the the story comes on I mean when do we heard anything back about some of the uh the research and the FBI investigation going on for the shooting in Las Vegas when did we hear about some of the other details that came up from these other things that once we have the short attention span we forget all about it\nI'd like to hear the rest of the story that they don't report because it doesn't fit the narrative so what do they do they sit on it\nAnd you know it's interesting Eddie because they create the narrative they also create the narrative by sitting on it now listen to understand what I just said how can you create a narrative by not talking about it\nThat's the narrative the narrative silence on a particular story that's the narrative that they are creating but that's exactly what they did with this and that is ... guys a clown\nYou look around you wonder where did this guy come from who is this guy some loud mouth obnoxious attorney from New York nobody's ever heard of before and now he's in he's out there with the Stormy Daniels now CNN won't even talk to him\n[laughter] that's pretty bad when CNN won't talk to a truck bashore\nBut that you can see this guy became news because they made him news because\nThey liked the things that he was saying which was nothing but hate filled rhetoric day in and day out\nSo that he was saying which was nothing but hate filled rhetoric day in and day out when people get a dose of this twenty four seven there are nut cases out there that begin to act on this stuff like Maxine Waters alright and others to this guy in Florida we don't know what this guy's deal as yet we're gonna watch this bizarre story unfold\nBut there are not cases on all sides of all spectrum and you start watching twenty four seven coverage of this and it's going to have an impact isn't it\n... oh it definitely is it's going to have an impact all over from a as you mentioned on both sides we don't know anything about this guy story we don't know anything about what he's done a we don't know whether it's true about the whole trip mobile and with the stickers all over the place or whether he had anything to do with it or not he's totally friend or whether he's just a nut again we want to we want to punish you ever did this\nBut we want to make sure it's the right person as well it's sad\nThat I I mean the running with this have you heard the media as you mentioned with their narrative\n... as soon as all this stuff happening what is the first thing they say was was we don't want to judge or we don't want to think about it but oh by the way Trump really created us because he creates the hate I mean come on you really think we've had him for two years now as president\nAnd he's been in the media for a year even prior to that as he was running for president and he said of course he took to take some shots at some individuals you detect elected officials you detect other reporters he's attacked other candidates and\nIt's two years into his office down all of a sudden people are sending out Fifteen bombs out to different Democrats\nAre the same time right before an election that could devastating entire election I highly doubt that that's going to be ... they're running it saying Trump created this it's his angry rhetoric it's his hateful rhetoric we need to stop him and showed him for whatever he's doing it all by the way I look at this person it's very\nEvident you know it was a Trump supporter he had pictures of him holding up Trump's side that he's got the Trump mobility it's\nObvious that we've connected the dots that all of a sudden he's the Trump supporters Trump people are ... and racist we would never do that because we are loving W people are even though we just kind of say look the anti black lives matter and all those good groups\nAnd we don't care what Maxine Waters have to say and we don't care what happens to Ted Cruz and his family and we don't care about\nSteve skull east being shot by an AK forty sevens wielding Democrat lunatic want to be assassin ... report that in the media\nThat it's it's it's it's ... that's the whole thing again this becomes the lie of omission see the angry mark begins to come out of the box here because I Know what the media is up to I've been studying this for years I Know how they do what they do and you know why they do what they do and when we see we call him out on it and it is fun to call them out on it but they're playing a very dangerous game a\nVery dangerous game and it's unfortunate you know Trump set of weed out yesterday saying that you know the vast majority of his anger in the in the country comes from the mainstream media while the media doesn't like to hear that\nExcept they forget the fact that they are the source that people read see and hear this is where their opinions come from because of what they see now I challenge you listener put it down for a week get off the TV don't\nCome home and watch the news turn the crap off what's\nYour phone down use it for phone calls and that's it and then set it down you're going to find out that you've got a life to live and guess what happens Andy when you don't watch this garbage you don't miss anything you\nDon't miss anything dried eight next is better than friday last because you didn't have to deal with all this going to go wow you know what what did I miss today nothing nothing and it and then we'll see them go ahead go ahead\nAnd here's here's ... to go on with it a little bit of I Would say especially right now during the election season so relieved focus on what's important when it comes to issue driven agenda and none of\nThis stuff none of the and none of the BS or the distractions or anything else but an election time right now this is one of the most important midterms that anybody has seen them they really really long time and it's time to focus on the issues and he's you see in the media it you're not going to get issued driven agenda discussions going on in the mainstream media\nNo and you already know what the issues are the impact you you already know where the people stand on that turned the crap off mute the ad when it comes on or just don't turn it on to begin with you\nKnow where you are you know what your issues are and my gosh if you're looking to people like Don Lemon\nAnd Chris Cuomo and the rest of these people or anybody I don't care who's a pond in it the retired so and so\nTo form your opinion and I'm not sure you should even be vote to be honest with you or there was a bold statement\nWhen we come back we'll continue the discussion with if you lose your the voice of reason think for yourself is what I'm telling you wow we're watching the mainstream media and kicking into high gear right now it's only gonna get worse between now and November sick so buckle\nThings to the ballot but it's I I mean I hear from callers every single day on my show or the number one issue that's taking them to the voting booth is the second amendment I've had on the n._r._a. and the chaos already with the Kansas State Rifle Association and talking about their endorsements all of our Republicans if a statewide level in national federal levels are solid\nA plus a a plus ratings with the n._r._a. they are I mean Kris Kobach is one of the most predominant pro gun guys you could possibly have running the state as governor if he ends up becoming one I mean you've probably seen the stories down there in writing in the in the parade with the jeep with a replica of the fifty Keller but she got that's made national news\nAid with the jeep with a replica of the fifty caliber she got that is made national news every one of our federal elected officials are pro solid Second Amendment individuals and they've turned that into an issue to or even the Democrats are now running seeing that they're pro Second Amendment to try and went over some of those supporters because\nKansas that's a huge issue to drive them to the voting booth\nWhich is the same thing with matching wish you the same thing up in Montana we see the same thing everywhere now here in Georgia you're seeing just the opposite Stacey Abrams is running far left socialist I Want to take your guns I Want to ban these things\nWant to repeal campus carry that we're going to see how effective that isn't a very red state in just a few days so good luck with that one but the same thing holds true in Kansas it's interesting\nHow because what you're going to see in this this this dynamic that is in play here that I mentioned you're going to see when you've got every town for gun safety for example taking tons and tons and tons of Bloomberg money\nAny any seat that flips they're going to claim flipped because of their pro pro gun control position that's what they're going to claim you're going to see the Democrats say they ran successfully on gun control agenda to try to make that a national agenda and we could I promise\nAs long as the day is twenty four hours long it's going to happen you agree\nOh absolutely it's going to great there's going to be two things that they want to run on and if they when they're going to blame it on the fact that people are tired of guns and they're going to say that Trump lost the election for them and it's all about Trump those are the two agenda the two items that they're going to run on in it as you mentioned I mean you can you can bet you that if the Democrats get a majority\nIn the state legislatures if they get a majority in one of the chambers of the federal level than guns are going to be one of those where they start saying hey maybe we start backing off on the gun rights to start putting in some regulations because we're sick and tired of hearing about all these school shootings\nYou know it's fascinating to me that because I can remember when I was a kid\nYou know you have three TV channels get ABC NBC CBS most Americans remember that unless you're one of the goofy millennials\nGot to have a name for your generation I don't know what my job we didn't have any plans for generations back then sorry idea you can I tell you you know if your generation shooting everybody I don't know what to tell you so I [laughter] it's actually not you were younger when the new or what what do they call the new one now genetics\nIs that what it is a yeah the genetics there's yeah ...\nI mean I don't know where this comes from I don't know what I was okay you're sixties and seventies I don't know what you were but it's fascinating to me because I remember when the TV at midnight when after the American flag waver they put the star Spangled Banner you went to bed\nI mean that's just what you did because there was no TV on overnight maybe you get some weird you know you a check channel or something like that but she had to have a weird intended for that it wasn't that long ago and the point that I'm trying to make his after an election people went about their day\nIn today's day and age they fight about it I hate about it in a rage about it because there's a twenty four hour news cycle that keeps this go away\nAnd people don't go on with their days anymore they go on with their days filled with hate and rage and that's what's happened we've seen that really since two thousand sixteen long before that but really manifesting it wants itself wants to Democrats realized holy crap we're not in any we've lost everything\nAnd they don't like that when we come back we'll continue the conversation will switch over to see more guns to talking with Andy Hoosier the voice of reason cake you am Wichita big talker back right after this don't go away [noise]\n\nAnd\nWhen I can count on for way which means of your family don't jak becoming our first
