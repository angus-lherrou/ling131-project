first and of course he just jumps out at you like thirty thousand people just say you've got chocolate voice lady you know working with you\nAnd the one person was like what's up with a girl and then you're on average ... oh well maybe not to write about writer on working on it I'm working on that if you're doing much better than much better dry fudge voice\nAll right let me go to the phone lines in St Louis welcome to lie to read it has been so incredibly incredibly patient Brett I'm going to give you the time you need my Fred what's going on well\nThank you I was calling about that fourteenth amendment issue sure and they had a couple of points uh one I don't think that Trump believes he has the power and I and I\nDisagree a little bit with that 'cause I think he was being a baby just trying to didn't want to get into it with Trump I don't believe Trump thinks he has the power to do that and I don't believe you\nAre you going to get your start the argument\nI think can start in the argument I think he wants to look at the interpretation and I do think there's an argument there even even though he may not win it\nBut I Do think looking at the unpleasantness of being born there having a jurisdiction and then using the conjunction owned and what we're talking explicitly about jurisdiction could be an argument that can be used but that was not in front of the law and I think that's what they'll try I think they may lose but they will try\nWas it what we we were interesting to me is that when you read through with Howard had to say\nIn the federalist papers they clearly says it wasn't intended for foreign dignitaries or aliens\nIt says that but they didn't put it in the fourteenth amendment and this is my argument my argument is William is wrong about intent my argument is that you're wrong about intent you're both right you're absolutely right the problem is they wrote it in plain English that's easy to understand it\nProblem is they wrote it in plain English that's easy to understand\nAnd it doesn't say it in there they should have made it longer they should've included not of course not including foreign dignitaries and and uh in aliens and so on I mean I bet it would be spelled out it would be clear and not one person can be an anchor baby the problem is the way they wrote it\nWas to some to be assumed that we would know what the intent was when that is the job of the founding document the founding document is meant to say these are the laws these are the rights these are the restrictions on government this is the way it is and if that doesn't cover everything amen to me\nUm the liberals are the ones who actually want us to interpret everything and make everything a living breathing document that's not what it is it's a chiseled in stone foundation and and I think that I think you and I understand that William was mad at me you've been on hold for a long time you're\nA guy called he was mad at me because I ... used to not read the English I just read would have said\nWell I understand that I think to do that um when it was originally written it was ... in regard to the slaves I don't think of the time they were thinking in terms of babies being born here\nHad not again when you're when you're a hundred percent right it was about slavery under probably only\nAt some point someone came along 'cause that's what lawyers do and interpret it that way and had it backed up well the possibility exists to reinterpret though because it was once an interpretation and self\nThat it was a oh don't you're you're right the Supreme Court interpret it I think an Eighteen Ninety six Eighteen Ninety somewhere around there and and they they're the ones that said yes this applies to anybody born here of yeah not not only do I want it to be reinterpreted I actually wanted\nTo be rewritten I Want to be altered to say the original intent not including foreign dignitaries not including aliens on including still in the blank make it clear because the founding documents should not be interpreted in my opinion it should be read and understood I don't think that's asking too much\nI don't think you're absolutely correct you know I think Trump will bring that out by pushing once he's going to push it out there whether or not he was and I probably will as you know but at least he's bringing it out and I'm good with that but when I only got\nOne other quick point I think you're like this is um I Do believe that William will be happy because we are if it does get reinterpreted we'll be right along with France they did that known to them did away with\nThe U.S as well very well thank God we we do want the laws of France will be our laws I guess All right appreciate your bread appreciate holding and I'd see there is a nice conversation now when I went back and he pretty much\nHas the same exact speech is William without getting all mad and frustrated in many got right to the point here is that they intended here's what it says here's a we have to do\nAnd and and also you know the reason why President Trump brought it up I think you'd probably right and I said earlier\nThis president has shown the ability\nThe unmitigated ability ability to to start a conversation in this country\nI don't care if you're on the left and you have them you're on the writing you love them or are you in between a you're not sure about he can through one tweet or through one quick age or of a question\nIn an interview say something that will get us all talking and I think that's a good thing I don't know anybody on any side can say that's a bad thing that we're talking about the constitution and what the meaning of the fourteenth amendment is ... you know what I'm saying I think that's a good thing to\nWrite back to the phone lines is going to be ah let's see your line one's going to be rained on what's going on in caves rental high\nYeah how you doing limited dream of rounds up\nOn the fourteenth amendment I think ... is pretty plain and simple for me or not just solely for slaves I Believe if a woman coming here to the legal process and she happened to get pregnant along the way and then all of a sudden she gets in and then as the baby a few months later\nThe baby gets to stay that way I look at it\nWell I agree that maybe just to stay with us she came here legally or illegally I think she should leave the problem is and the reason why we have the issue that we have these chain migration and visitation I'm I'm a I'm a travel as Ted Cruz talked about\nWe need to get rid of chain migration the babies born here I agree it's a citizen because that's what the fourteenth amendment says to me\nThe mother isn't it the mother is a citizen of wherever the hell she came from your baby all day but I don't know I I don't agree with you the baby can stay she's got to get out and and we start making that the deal guess what they're not going to be coming here and having babies\nAnd leave their babies year and by the way there are some rule that says you can't take your baby back with you to Honduras even if the babies the United states citizen I don't think so I never leave my baby and I take it back with me\nYeah why even have the legal process law if people are able to just dump their kids off whenever they want you know\nI I wouldn't know listening I again the fourteenth amendment says what it says\nThe dare I say it carries should I say it I'll go ahead it is what it is ...\n... ...\nTo hate is ... ... ... it is what it is and again I I Believe is clear several times over the years said again\nFor those of you are new to the show um it does have you were going to try what should leave find 'em you come here illegally you drop a kid it that that is the the medical term right ... ... ...\nNow you know\nDrop the kids slapped wire and then there it is it's an American citizen congratulations\nBrave ... go your ass back to\nMexico to be just ... it's got to be ... and I and I'll spell it out I'll spell it out as simply as I possibly can\nYou come here you have the baby the babies are citizen you've got three choices but the baby up for adoption leave the baby was with somebody who's in the United states who's a relative that easier legally or you take the child back with you the idea that you had the child here and it's now it should assume which again I agree there's fourteen ... says so\nBut then you get to stay and the dad just to come here from wherever and then the grandparents get the gum and then the tea on the tea I get to come and everybody else forget it dude no you had the baby here three choices take the baby back with you which is the humane thing to do is it's apparent leave\nThe baby here up for adoption you never see you again or do the baby to a relative of your issues here in the United states legally that's very simple we should make that the law and you'll see a decrease in people coming across the border and dropping the kid um\nAnd and the getting all these benefits that will stop that magnet will go away but instead we're having an argument about the actual fourteenth amendment\nIt says what it says\nNow let's do something that makes sense for the safety and security and for the future of our country at the same time we work on possibly\nAltering this amendment it's edited nine four

don't know there's the Michigan border with Canada dairy is huge in Michigan Canada's been been terrifying the dairy from Michigan to the tune of almost three hundred percent how close are you watching it because I Know that the other side I'm guessing your competitor\nFeels this way has a problem with the with the president trying to even things out\nYou know what the president's trying to do is rebalance trading relationships and get a better deal kind of a better deal for Michigan into and you know at first he cut taxes for America and are Republicans in Congress in Michigan which means we're moving their production of the Rand truck\nFrom Mexico to Michigan around and that happened before it's remarkable and now he's trying to rebalance trading relationships because\nBecause tags the or you know the manufacturing worker in in in Michigan was left out of this uh you know there's a global economy when the elite is a\nUh in New York and the west coast are enjoying themselves that we had tooling guy shots closing down and ... and people lose their jobs and so now a President Trump is it wants to rebalance relationships get a better deal and with respect to agriculture you know I got I received the endorsement of the Michigan Farm Bureau which is a huge uh\nHave your cultural organization and and so on their guy and I'm going to be a hard working a governor for a a farmers across the state of Michigan and I want to milk producers you get a better deal a fair deal\nI I Love that you brought up automotive and again as bill ... the Republican who's the attorney

Thomas the guy who wrote the book the right about the rights also the movie the right was based on father Jerry Thomas we've had probably Gary on the show before um you know and I don't think people understand\nHow\nI guess extra systems one of those like atom bombs or spirituality right the right of exercises um\nWas first published in sixteen fourteen\nBy pope Paul the fifth\nAnd the reason why they published it is because he was hoping to quell a trend of laypeople in priest or hastily performing extra systems on people they presumed repossessed and those included people who had the bubonic plague\nIn fact there's a line in the right that said The Exorcist you should be careful distinguish between demon possession melancholy which was a catchall for mental illness\nSo I mean from the beginning\nThere was always that fine line that most priests had to walk with regard to extra system and mental illness so the church knew back then\nThat they were mental problems and and uh it said that the extra ... should not have anything to do with medicine Bailey medicine to the doctors they should handle all the spiritual stuff so you know father Gary is holding an actress ... witchcraft\nThen you know this is this is not some physical situation this is something that's very spiritual the spiritual warfare\nAnd it's too you know spiritual warfare I was told once that things like Armageddon things like you know the apocalypse they all begin on a spiritual level\nThe S. gets on begins on his spiritual level and then it happens to manifest itself\nIn the physical and material world and so once his manifest in the physical material world an old demons are unleashed all hell breaks loose\nAnd every extra shift is worth their weight becomes the army of God and they and they fight not just Catholic exercises but there are plenty of others to from\nVarious races are Jewish and Muslim extra sister or to get an evangelical crew Hispanic religions that are due deliverance which of course bringing people from the throes of satanism or from the throes of demonic possession into the arms of Jesus or into the arms of God\nAnd that seems to be what people are looking for they're looking for some sort of\nI don't know they're looking for some sort of refuge they feel that they've lost\nTheir way they've lost their soles of their soldiers have been given up some guy caught my show last night and said that he gave us each shoulder to shoulder the devil\nAnd I asked him why he and he told me that he said but he gave his life back to Jesus and I don't know if that can happen\nBut I mean you know it's not up for me to decide that you know is that it prevented decide whether this guy who shoulder to shoulder the devil\nTo give us so back to Jesus it's just crazy that ah you know people when they're down you know like like instead of melancholy people who have melancholy [noise] uh as opposed to people who are truly possessed and believe it or not here's the thing that I learned I learned that you know not only is The Exorcist and right you know\nGo back to sixteen fourteen for that there is also now psychiatry [noise] psychiatry is being recognized a [noise]\nA possession they're not going to call dealing possessed really calling a number of things I'm Talking about that coming up on ground zero [noise] a lot of psychiatric terms for what is happening to the world that we're having to people and how the devil seems to be calling in people responding to release except for three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred\nIn a lot of the dark guards everything has its roots\nIn pre eastern magic in philosophies and it's from the Christian reformers in the end and the Christian Church\nThere is stabbed lists some of the other values and sometimes they embrace some of the pagan values and so that's why sneaking up from behind this is the devil\nBut it's not necessarily the devil it's real it's a devil that we make out to be a hallmark card 'em horns sharp tail and\nA little beer needs is basically riding his hands waiting for the next person that you can buy a soul from or sell it to somebody's telling their story can take and basically manipulated I mean some guy was freaking out the other night about the loser for show they are giving glory elusive or by making TV show that I Know they're not\nMaking moves the fictional character that makes him Gloria is Dante did it\nDoesn't do inch\nPutting it into practice is what does it putting it into practice doing bad things to your fellow man that's where you're putting into practice being a monster being a person who hates being a person doesn't care about human life or geared to you that's where you put yourself in the place of the devil that as a glorified the devil\nThat is what creates the atmosphere necessary for the idea of possession for the idea of casting spells curses or whatever you want to call them\nAnd we're at a time where it's easy to do it because people figure that it's going to help them to do something that would be considered blasphemous in order to make it work for them\nAnd then in the end they'll say oh I I decided to wash my hands of it all I sold my soul to the devil but now that I've accepted Christ I think I'm gonna be okay\nI don't know if that works\nThen again I'm not ... and they don't make that decision\nStill it's kind of weird it's awkward\nAnd I think things are starting to show themselves what they truly are so that's why this Halloween and there's been this emphasis is not that I'm taking pride in this is this ... this emphasis because of the fact that almost every day is April Fools and every night is Halloween it just appears that way right now in the United states\nGo to Thomas in Illinois Hi Thomas your own ground zero\n... are you doing man\nHey I just wanted to start and say uh I really appreciate you appreciate the show and are you talking about the topics that really need to reach out more and uh that's a wonderful thing thank you just said a couple of verses from the Bible that I thought were hurting it and I'm\nThe first ones and as a fifty nine fourteen and says justice is turned back and righteousness fans far away for a truce as in the street right justice cannot enter his truth is lacking and he turns aside from evil makes himself a pray and a and there's a\nClean reading this time there's a time was that was actually reading a passage today federal you know\nVery good and uh you know there's another one I'm sixty two because they show the synagogue you had to look that whoever kills you will think they're doing job service and that's what's been happening it's happening in the line is where the truth is the flowers\nAnd the majority you know they believe they're doing jobs surface ... not maybe the God of the fight over it\nAnd people are unprepared for I mean the issue and all those who are who they got will will suffer persecution of at the gospel and all these topics you know it's it's happening so fast it's wrapping up it seems like time has gone by faster and um it's it's a it's a permanent things the church\nI think it's important I think it's important to have you know a spiritual idea of both sides in order to have it in your arsenal so the knowledge of good\nPermeate throughout you but the knowledge of how bad operator out evil operates and what he's done to Clinton that evil that is\nI think very important and and that's why you know you just talked and some people have a hard time talking about it they don't want to\nEven open up or entertain any conversation about the devil revealed the devil is going to jump through the radio strangled him to be the holy hell out of them well that doesn't happen what happens is that they're like I said a couple of days ago there was a rule there are rules that demons play by not all demons play by those rules\nBut most of the time the deal by certain rules and and and those rules when you break them the devil or demons or whatever it is it's waiting for you that spiritual entity that parasitic infiltration\nIs waiting to happen and when he does you know you're going to have to be prepared or how to get it out of you if it's like catching a cold it's like it's like catching a reoccurring cold or flu\nYou know if you get at one time you know hopefully it goes away enough to deal with sometimes those things linger and you have to do you know some harsher remedies to get rid of it and I think that that when you're talking about exercises and when you're talking about possession\nExercise them is not just going and saying All right you're free that doesn't happen most exercises and take months most extra citizens take forever and it's going to take a long time for us to exercise or at least try to purge from all of us this division and hatred experience and I think\nThat's right you know it says a yes as my people parents or lack of knowledge\nAnd uh I think that's the big one is the spiritual warfare that people don't even know they're fighting and I think it starts with pride people are caught up they're distracted or their own little trinkets solve all the movies and football games in a you know they're distracted and\nWell I think Tom as soon as the way I think people I think people\nShould have entertainment I think people should have things that\nCan can distract them for time it's not always I mean I'm not the kind of kind of person is going to say hey you know you shouldn't do that 'cause it's distracting from the real thing\nPeople should take time for the real thing and if you'd take time for entertainment that you take time for reading and take time for enjoying a a lot of fun ah activities or we're not you know we don't want to walk around being pious idiots but we certainly want to be aware of what's going on around us and we certainly want to be aware\nThat does something is a foot and we need to be able to defend ourselves when that stuff goes down let's go to Dan in Virginia Hi Dan you're on ground zero\nHey then yes the by man I've got a special little deal here with you there for you now I never told anybody about this and the guards to on a talk radio\nAnd I've got a special twist on there so the first thing I Want to mention it to you is that from men Nineteen eighty four clear on up to the almost the beginning of light Cain eighty six I was in a spiritual battle\nWith an extended family of black which is and we're talking about grandmothers and grandfathers and everything clear on both sides and they were affiliated with the Tulsa mob\nAnd I tried to help rescue this woman in front of them now what I did\nIs I said at some energy which kept them so ... about how to attack me that I knew that they love to argue amongst one another so the more that I kept\nThey argue amongst one another so the more that I kept them could fused the more that they argued amongst one another and there are a whole group self destruct just see\nWhat you what did you do put a ... when I called you wanted to Egypt words you don't want to\nKnow what I did as I said\nThis possible options in other words I trick them into thinking that I'm showing them vulnerabilities on how to attack me but I set it up so that these windows that they would perceive\nWouldn't make them so confused and overwhelmed by the different options that they could apply to attack me that they couldn't make up their minds what it is to do\nAnd then what happened was they started arguing amongst themselves and then once I felt that vicious circle of argument all I did was speed it up\nAnd then that about it when it finally too cold and it took about a year I have to do it\nWhat happened was is the whole group self destruct it some of them actually went to Christ because I found out because I had my own spies and some of 'em just retreated damage to themselves\nAnd so uh I I I've been there you know\nSo you've done spiritual battle with which is so yeah\nAnd also see I also have known very wise or once they've done a magic myself and about Ninety nine percent\nOf all kinds of practices along those lines deals with self knowledge and protection against aspects\nOf yourself Ninety nine percent of it has to do with that it doesn't have anything to do with the uh doing things apart others 'cause you have to take care of yourself first okay yeah\nSo it makes your your your well would you sell your right within yourself the spiritual and before you start taking on which is I got it\nThat way and actually that's what I learned from which it\nAll day so you learn from the which is what you turned it on them\nYou know they learn from the also learn from the white rich okay well I didn't date so the wife which is are the ones that explained to me because I've done all kinds and advance magic and everything but the first thing they\nThere

levitated off to bed at a number of other things what were some of the things that most impressed you I mean the limitations something that fascinated\nA regret it because he said that uh he'll it with the a lot of other brother and had to hold down the body of the school board and it said they could use that big men in the room or some of the other things that surprised you about what rather writer had to say about that night or the nights you was there during the exercise and\nWeight you know he talked about the um [noise]\nAbout the hospitals structure of the hospital he talked about ... in the ruling\nAnd um I mean these are physical manifestation at\nThat ... apparently it boy who was playing with the white girl boy playing with the uh we'd you would with a grandmother\nUm had had many aiming it was it ... a did love a tape um\nMany of the ... brothers who are still around who you know label to tell me check in and they all ha ha ha I'm a kitten a kid did locate the trade food tray\nLevitated ... each had one of the things that kind of kick him out a little bit with the kids a boat\nOr a lost like where do you look at\nYeah that was a ... that'll be in our next we have a separate from saying that I thought that was\nKind of ice cream the kid would always have like what are you with\nThe actor and he said he had to tell him to shut up over and over again because it drove him not only could ever had he was barely watch over midnight and then when he was going through is a moment just speaking Latin even speak ... you would swear in Latin\nAnd then he would laugh like would would [noise]\nSay a little bit of before so the the interesting interesting thing where he just several of the brothers were so affected by that that\nThey left um being a they went into a ... but he didn't speak while you're on TALK\nAbout this a monetary coming over or where you go to the next segment we'll be right back with more state to this is an exclusive on ground zero\nAre happening\n\nI don't know why\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nOh\nYeah\nHow are\n\nThe\nDevil is real or you don't fool around with things like that was also interesting that he gave detail on when\nHe was there the body would ... they tried to hold it down and then there was a sequence he said\nWhere they brought in a food tray and the food trays shot up into the into the into the air very high ceilings you said when he came back down to came crashing down and not one more sort of food and or anything on the tray was was disturbed\nBeen betrayed when I came back down with dumping disturb you also said something to the effect that\nAre not only a you know with the swearing in Latin things and by opening the wouldn't repeat to you he also said and this is something that's a ... it's horrible so that you would pee everywhere on every one is that true that he would just\nIt would urinate everywhere to say that the devils leaving him or something it ... it\nWas ... ... yeah he said that he said that there was a you know the the devil the tea all over everything they say look at the devils story you know he liked it a normal boy and then and then soon after that\nHe would start back up again ... ... ... ... they do the the whole thing yet but um it was a\n... I think if I Would have gone through that I Would also be like\nChurchill ... okay my daughter's idle you I Would go I yeah I I Would go into hiding too I mean imagine\nWhen you've been through this is three months or gay three months of dealing with like you said a young boy who you know swears in Latin speech in Latin to the priest\n... they tried to hold it makes it or I Can't remember how many brothers and he said we see thirty if I remember in the interview thirty men will bring him down how many said\nThey were sick people by the by the way they they were they were casting praying doing okay you know this was a\nIt was a big ordeal right up there up there's a statue there in that hospital that were given to them after ... to which it was a locally very popular he well known local ...\nAnd ... there were several said that hospitals electric hospital though right as when you when you walk in there it has a lot of the stuff that\nYou know about that ah the educating I guess I'm kind of they they talk about it you know it it's all there on the on the walls it interesting interesting a go to it\nWould be wondering do you answer the interview maybe you can give me some clarity here now when the boy was in Maryland this is when he first had the possession was in Maryland and they moved to St Louis wasn't near the story of one of the priests who attempted to exercise in the beginning and Marilyn ... or you had a stroke at writing to broke his arm or what oh okay\nSo it'd be broke his arm uh the the boy was twelve year old boy with a with a um a Protestant and um he he uh\nThe guy the the minister try to exercise in and kill the Hollywood Bowl are right and the uh the kids and the mother's sister was going to school at St Louis originally it was\nIn ... in a she went and talked to structure it so that they tell you about it and that's where the Jesuits became evolved\n... if he was he was Lutheran ...\nLutheran yeah the family converted to Catholicism\nHere I Would do anyway my boy was invested in one day he comes out of the hospital these these perfect do fine after that\nYeah yeah that was ... and that's what he said at the end you know the ... all of your voice\nYeah that's what he said twelve year old and\nIt was it was a very interesting to listen to but I you know I I thought they were the ... to get this last ditch there'll be being a nurse for many years there have been working in a ... you know you you kind of get\nAn idea of you know ... or ... until I wanted to make sure that this story got out in the first ... first had something\nWhy do you you you you let us be the show to do it because I think that a lot of people for a long time and given many I'm sure like I've heard stories of\nYou know other radio shows that if you know it dealt with this subject talking about the the real live exercises in Berlin do but I don't think anyone who's ever produced\nA the eyewitness accounts from a nurse was there a British writer who spoke I being the exclusivity of your interview in the in the fact that you even were able to get it after he made his route silence I think it's it is remarkable and it's and it's awesome about it's awesome you did that\n[noise] yeah you know I I've tried several times to get it out over the last ten years in in many different ways and something always comes up\nUm and then yesterday a when I was called by a guy that's OK Hitler to get it yeah luckily able to get it out this time\nIt's still on the idea is there's a lot of interest because I Know that uh I think a free

is Dr Jeff Cohen\nAlso a member of the synagogue that was attacked oh wow yeah audio clip here from Dr Cohen talking about this it's pretty much gone viral if you have not heard it this is the head of

from\nThat to where he is today that's going to deal or state that we have to wrestle with as a society where you were sort of\nAt the head of the team\nThat saved his life [noise]\nIt may be a bit of

time he comes up with this whole idea that he wants to basically change something that I think it's in the ... right yeah now now they're saying that\nThe phrase anybody here's a deal anybody who's born in the United states no matter where their parents are from for instance if a woman is pregnant she's visiting here from some other country and the child is born here that child is an American citizen and has all the rights and privileges of an American citizen\nOr the president says he thinks that by executive order he can change that right and it's not happening because the phrase says this person born in America is subject to all the rights and privileges and so\nThey may try that the thing is it puts the Republican leadership kind of a tough position does yeah and it's not the first time that around and has been in the that quite often right here before the election you know they probably wish she hadn't done that but a ...\nThat will never come to fruition never going to happen\nNow the Quinnipiac poll is out uh yesterday Ted Cruz five points up on a Beto O'Rourke it doesn't matter\nYou still have to go vote I mean poems or polls yeah um I think the last one Texas

provide to our customers\nAnd is there a will to do that in your view\n[noise]\nThere is among some of us but Anders nod among everybody so it's it's hard to say I I I find it kind of interesting to see how the left is just come out apoplectic against it when it's really easy to Google birthright citizenship and you find a video from Harry Reid back in Nineteen Ninety three when he was in the Senate saying that\nIt was never intended to be adjudicated the way it is today where somebody comes here illegally\nCan have a U.S citizen then suddenly try to claim chain migration status with that\nSo uh last week when we were talking to governor rabbit on friday thinking we're talking about maybe eight hundred active duty troops coming down to the borders of a of a few states now we're looking at fifty two hundred that's a quite a different response or thoughts about that level of respond well I think we've got to do everything\nThat we can to ensure the integrity of our southern border my preference would be to versus the way the president trying to do that now is to work with the Mexican government and actually have our troops along with Mexican troops on the southern side of the border that we we don't have problems with ... as\nA in terms of trying to use the military to enforce a worst security but if you did on the other side and the set up a these\nAre the same places if you will for those folks to be processed or one of the challenges the caravan say I've is as they come and they stick their foot on our side of the border and they've got to go through our legal system and we just don't have the resources to do that under current law\nAnd the answer you wind up in a catch and release situation the second thing that happens if they're going to apply for asylum or for ... for a visa so they can work they're going to be barred from that because they entered illegally\nAnd so this if they really wanted to have a fair shot at commuting and legally it'd be better stop them on the other side of the more ah and then a lot of them are going to be turn around because they're not going to qualify for asylum and they're not going to I'm a fifth of labor profile that we're looking at in terms of immigrants\nCars from ... studios this morning of last week you were two days since seemed to president where he kind of mentioned is ten percent tax decrease which seem to catch everybody by surprise is a week later what can you tell us about that\nWell I've had some conversations read some correspondence from German Brady on this and there there is technically a way to do this where you could pass up the house and Senate and the president can sign it prior to the election next week it's a little gummy uh for my taste I regret either a go through the regular word processing Congress\nAnd so my hope would be that we bring it up in the lame duck session also you know we need to bring up immigration more security in one more time and we we had two shots of that in June and July it failed both times because no Democrat what sport and you had a small group of Republicans\nThey wouldn't support it so I'm hoping that those two things can get a lot done in the lame duck\nThe uh Texas Tribune in UT poll came out more than three quarters of the state's voters said that their family finances both national and state economies are ah the same or better\nThere's some consumer confidence out there yeah it's the highest since the year two thousand is pretty amazing how uh how good people feel I've I've been seeing this for months as I walked down main street a district Seventeen or walk down the neighborhood streets of district Seventeen people really really happy right now\nAnd they mostly tuned out loud noises coming out of Washington and I think that's probably to their benefit [laughter]\nYou know we uh we play the soundbite today the president of the ah the hospital in Pittsburgh who happened to be a member of the synagogue there was attacked um\nHe spoke to the idea of a of this rhetoric that is out there not individually just the rhetoric that is out there and a colonel certainly a person's emotions can be the entire spectrum but how do how do we address that in this day and well we need to\nTry to find a way to return to civility you and I have talked about this on this show in the past I mean this this is not I mean that the press is trying to blame it on the on conservatives and the president but if you think about where this actually started it started by the less reaction to the lawfully election of of a president\nOr in that in this case Donald Trump and they just went dessert and if you look at that starting with the stuff that they were doing out in in a at Berkeley and and the shootings ... and several others\nUh it's just it just spun out of control and and I think both sides are to blame the president has partially to blame I Wish you'd tone down his rhetoric I'm\nNow he said some things during the campaign that I think um\nYou know have kind of gone away but then every now and then he'll embrace something that I Wish you wouldn't like a couple of weeks ago he was talking about Greg June fourth day from ... Montana he's the guy that body slammed reporter and he was kind of sort of\nA complimenting ... represented ... for doing it for the for doing that I I don't think he should have done that on them and I think the president would say fewer things like that that that it would go a long way\nBut that said it's not going to stop the left I mean you heard Don Lemon on CNN just yesterday said ... Democrats shooting people on remind him that it was a Democrat shots these ... others mhm uh last a year ago Jane\nYeah if we eliminate some of the platforms that it probably would help um so what are the things that we continue to struggle with is what will happen to Obamacare the Affordable CARE Act um there's some numbers out there as far as what that is really done to insurance rates you got those you could share it with sure lemme lemme\nRemind everybody what a President Obama said the the three promises he made it all turned out to be big lives one is that if you want to keep your doctor you keep your darker view want to keep your plan you keep your plan and\nOne is and if you want to keep your doctor you keep your darker view want to keep your plan you keep your plan\nAnd their premiums are going to go down twenty five hundred dollars from here in Texas premiums went up by eighty two percent we had huge loss a plan a plan options in this state and of course a lot of people lost their their doctors that they like to have\nUh the new numbers are just now rolling out over the ... and because of the work that we as Republicans in Congress have done to sort of defying some of the worst parts of Obamacare a premiums nationwide are going to go down for the first time\nIn all the years and among peers in place is gonna is not much it's but it's one percent decrease it reflects a one percent degrees here in Texas state wide they're going to go up one and a half percent but that's after increases of eighty two percent since two thousand and Thirteen so that's a good sign\nBut the biggest insurer on the exchange in Texas Blue Cross Blue Shield and they're going down by about six and a half percent now it's going to vary by county\nUm but but six and a half percent state why that's a good trend and I and a\n... is a Republican so I think that we ought to take credit for what we've done in Congress and then also what the president's been able to do with ... with a comic or\nThe other thing we're going to see is you're going in many counties you only have one option of for it for healthcare coverage you're going to see expanded options and several counties not all counties but several can\nFinally did a week from today we'll know are generally what's gonna happen with the national elections last night Nancy Pelosi said the house we'll flip so what is the Republican leaderships game plan a if you continue to hold the house and be if the ...\nI think there is a little better than fifty fifty chance that we hold the house and had reminder buddy Nancy Pelosi has been predicting since two thousand and uh since we had the big wave in two thousand ten that she was going to get get her gamble back and she hadn't gotten it yet\nBut that said assuming that we keep the majority would be a pretty thin majority so we'll have to I'm trying to find ways to get things done and it will be a little bit tough\nWell where's the urgency where are the areas where there's urgency in\nMy view of the world is first of all we got about the things we talked about I think we need to to read get our arms back around immigration and border security and hopefully the militancy on each side of the spectrum of dynamic is we need and reconsider the two bills we looked at in June July\nThe second thing we need to do is look at it the second uh you know the next step on tax reform the president's proposed ten percent tax cut for working class Americans I think we need to look at that I think you'd have Democrats vote for this time\nAnd then the um the third thing is we still have about twenty five percent a government that's only funded through early December and we ... we need to get a look at that in the end but I didn't say birthright we could look at that as part of immigration and more security there and we'll ... we'll\nWe'll know a lot more week from today coverage and bill forest Georgia's almost everyone did he can hear the interview archived

B. C. us agencies refocus its efforts are recruiting more events we were kind of\nEverywhere for a little bit but now that we have a director of conventions we are really silly focus back on the rebuilding that associations markets most of our people that are going to come in for a meeting or a conviction are going to be Texas local\nSo they're going to come in because we're such a drivable market from all over the state of Texas and also you used to the airport for those who are kind of in that outlined area in West Texas and in southern Texas\nBut we're able to get them here and those associations are\nKnocking on the door where we put our name back out there again we've been able to be a participant and some of the trade shows and really make a name for ourselves so that people are asking what is going on right College Station there so much fro what is happening we need to be a part of it\nSo we've also included some cells missions to Austin to make sure that we're staying in front of them and also Texas a and M. university with all of those professors and\nThat could be members there we know they're members of all kinds of organizations whether national or even state and so we're talking to them and try to get them to keep their events here arena and hear those events that they may attend and other places can sit here so we're working with them to try to get them to keep them here um and bring them here\nWe're also I'm\nPromoting and enabling site visit more sight of the time and time again we hear well where's the College Station and even if you say well it's the home of types of CNN\nThey still can't point that out on the map so it's great that they can make that connection\nWhat is it and how do you see it and what is that so we bring them in this meeting planners were bringing sports planners into our community travel writers so that they can see what we do have to offer and we can give them the experience that we want them to talk about and we can build it with them we've had a lot more I think with um interest\nFrom travel writers and bloggers coming to our community to experience different things football season is a big help especially when those visiting teams right about it and send that out and then we're generating\nInterest off of that to get more people into our community\nOne of the tools Eby CEOs has had for five years is the preferred access agreement for facilities or churches or you know so far southern events have been booked on campus leading to the silt nearly five thousand hotel room nights\nHave to keep in consideration that we're talking about a university campus we can't compete necessarily for those times when faculty are students need those facilities and so we're trying to fill date that they have available that aren't taken by those that the students and faculty\nSo we're working on availability for the university an interesting thing is the availability for the university is opposite the availability for our community so we had some challenges with that but I think we've overcome those challenges and this is one way of doing so in the last year\nIs having these seven but things that we have had on campus and there are more down the pipeline there still some leads out some rather large conferences or when you add in the hotel that is now open\nAnd says oh when you add in the hotel that is now open\nThat ads and just an extra added value to using cost field or using those facilities on campus so we've been able to really see some growth in people wanting to come to the community and wanting to Tom specifically to that hotel\n... to ... new road Joan Crawford sooner and whether that facility perusing will go hotel arguments eternity which\nThey are and they're very competitive with the market um so they're easy to work with they are and they're\nDefinitely focused on keeping themselves full besides football game so I'm there\nWith us it a lot of the different trade shows and things that we go to they go with us or we go with them or sells calls or whatever it is that we can really advertise them as an opportunity and a place\n... e B CEO skills priority to our temperature sites and recruiting events\nWe put in place and a ton of uh our own internal side policy that if a invents this somewhere else and not in those facilities we tried to push those those facilities first I'm In\nThe cost of still even though those are those facilities on campus or at a reduced\nCost um sometimes these groups it's still a little bit higher and expense for them so\nThankfully we have other meeting Venus like the expo and even some of our other hotels and use that are able to host these meetings um the breath of centers one we've had several groups that has used the ... center also [noise] um\nSo we had those insulated groups of it fits in it's a better fit in those places were trying to\nShow those often when we do the site visit we don't just post focus on here's the campus hotel in the in facilities\nWe show them all the other options and we take them to those places and let them see what those look like and how their group might fit\nPossibly better there or if they choose to go well you know will work with them there too but we tried to show the whole community and all the things that are available to them\n... the experience of travel

and they kill you want to get engaged but if you want to just be insulting I don't care that doesn't among\nUm obviously myself several times if you if you don't get it yet or six not really I mean any more\nOne of the very quickly go through these fourteenth amendment dumb phone calls I'm not going to be able to debates with everybody at let's let's just get down to it\nYou know where I stand on it we all agree that it should be changed\nIt it'd be the the fact that there is a birthright citizenship for anybody and everybody is a problem clearly so let's fix it and now we have to figure out how we devised a plan to infect fix it we got the phone lines and say hello and welcome to Eddie and it'd be an eddy what's going on\nYeah Hi I'm doing a good job I agree with you and I spent ah ah as far as Halloween goes my kids are Thirteen sixteen we had a great\nTime putting their costumes together and I never tell them that they can't go trick or treating ... how old they are so awesome I was told that when you're a teenager you need to stop\nI'm not going to be that way and that the other thing about the fourteenth amendment alright let's ask this question I Can't get an answer for it when it when it when it immigrant has a child in this country\nShe decides to take that child back to her country you know a child's being a U.S citizen when that child turns Eighteen and they come back to the United states without a problem yes well that could be a problem\nThere's I mean I I've I've known people I've known people that were born in Texas and before they're even a year old moved away far away to Europe and then came back as as fourteen Fifteen sixteen year old and there were still fully American citizens absolutely\nWell I think we need to shore this up before it's too late\nAll right sounds good any we appreciate you open line now eight nine four one packs interesting question\nIf you were born here and you have citizenship when you're born in and everybody does right now I'm you're going to retain that citizenship unless you're we now to somewhere um so yeah I mean for me it's an interesting question but it's pretty simple answer back to a dominant Minnesota Don what's going on\nYour next economic oh I Want to say that that caller just from the Kansas City guy for eight minutes belongs in the Radio City talk talk talk radio hall of fame\n... it was a great call I think he did great\nI I'm I'm Serious because the classic devastation of how two people can disagree and neither one of those yeah and that that's the problem we're going to risk losing that in the next the future if they don't do something about it\nAnd I don't mind you're gonna find this hard to believe or to people who took to Twitter to told me I was rude to that guy didn't let him talk either so I'm not really I I don't really know what I'm supposed to do it would be honest with\nYou know I I you know I Know what I felt like they need those people to make you and I looked good okay not have them All right [laughter] you know we have the problem but you know if there was if this guy on the from Kansas City with a lefty you would not elastic\nThirty seconds before a cardio a thumb hit wrong or are you know I'm a former whatever right or racist a bigger and that's the problem we have because non rational people cannot engage in a conversation even though they disagree with each other and not\nCannot tolerate that they're losing this battle it's not it's not so much a loss of conversation or are a lot of the argument for them if they're saying hey I mean it's just it's just me are nobody I I have to all the rent and that\nIt's just me are nobody I I have to all the men and that's the problem they are having this culture and we're going to have more of that and that's it but last had become speaker on Fox and really scared of that\nWell I I agree with you it is he blows you shouldn't be getting the gamble back but but I Do want to comment on what you're saying\nI Am willing to have the conversation with anybody of invited left these on my show a million times they never want to come on I in fact are afraid to come on and it's not about shouting people down it's not about me if I talk louder than you I win that's why I yesterday I had to put the guy on hold because he was getting angry and he's talking loudly\nIt's about actually mixing it up but the way I mix it up and again maybe people will understand my my dinner table example when I'm sitting at the dinner table with a very large Italian family and we're all having discussion we're ... we're interrupting were were laughing we're stopping each other on the face I mean we're we're we're doing what we do to converse together\nAnd then by the end of it we say hey that was great and we give each other a hug I think that people think there's a difference a decorum that's supposed to be in place\nBecause I'm doing it on the radio there isn't if you say something and I want to interrupt you I'm going to because I'm the I'm the guy who is hosting the conversation\nAnd and if I'm interrupting it's for a good reason not to shut you down and say oh my God he's making a good point I Want to shut dumb off no you said something that I Want to comment on I think ... so many times and and it will be here if I'm wrong about this but\nSo many times people call him have a full\nHead of steam they want to see thirty two different points and then expect me to comment on it I Can't I'm not that smart you say two points comment\nYeah any any any doubt I had about being just like arguing with an argument has gone right now because you know I it was just such a you know that that was the classic where me and I want to keep listening to you that's how I Want to say before I had to\nGo out and I my appreciation to add a Minnesota we appreciate dom he's a great listener six days a week you listen to the weekend too and and again I have no problem conceding to point to Joe that the the people that say they have standing may not have standing\nAnd if they do in fact if they are in fact found to have standing they could lose at the Supreme Court level bill when by the way the Ninth Circuit court of appeals if it gets there\nBut they I think they they have a good chance of losing the Supreme Court and maybe that's the mastery of what the president is trying to do\nBut I don't want this president or any president because look if we say yes I'll give you the the Harry Reid example Harry Reid was dumb enough to to go with the nuclear option of fifty one just a simple majority when it comes to deciding things in the Senate he did that because he thought the Democrats would always have the Senate\nAs soon as the Republicans got the Senate they started using the same rule the same thing but he did and the left these have been complaining and could fetching arguing and yelling and screaming and crying and going himself Spartacus ever since\nSo we must be very careful if we really did have a problem with bronco bomber through executive the are changing laws and changing the way this country was founded if we really had that problem let's make sure we're consistent now because President Trump will not be the president forever\nEventually somebody else is going to be the president and it might even be a Democrat I Hope not but it might be and if it is do you want the Democrat Jay prompted it why can't I Do it you can't always switch how you feel about very defined topics\nBecause of who's in whatever office it is whether you support the person or don't let's be consistent I think that's a it's a pretty simple thing to do\nBack at it it's going to be a line one is going to be cited in uh in Houston side what's happened got about a minute\nElements are packed are you doing yeah first time I'm not getting into your radio show a great show thank you but I just want to say a few things after you factor that are missing from this conversation sure all\nFocusing on the amendment and you know how the baby on should not be\nA a you know if their parents are legal and all that but one factor that'd be neat to kind of look into it also is the United states going in terms of its population in the age where I'm most baby boomers are you know retiring and you know all of that is coming to an end so if you're going to start treating citizenship it's such a narrow terms\nThat are kind of and this is a question or not an attack\nAre kind of restricting sales from a a human capital as a country as they\nKnow how I mean we were growing in population like crazy three hundred twenty million people in and growing when he's talking about\nWell because of the diet or because of the demographics of the United states right now most identify huge population that is retiring and the younger generation was already you know that's been a couple of wars and you know they got involved in that that has affected us\nSo what I'm seeing is because compared to other countries are population the young population is not on that level or the other populations are worried are now I'm not I'm all for the fact that these should protect the United states\nFrom illegal broad healing activities like if somebody comes in and have a baby and then they're just trying to you that that's\nCertain way you notice I didn't they all black or or singing about white people no place in our lexicon that sort of stuff I doubt that Don Lemon has a morals clause because uh in an doesn't have any more\nThat's actually a great point I think you're probably right it is a share of David Clark\nMorals [laughter] that's actually a great point I think you're probably right it is a share of David Clarke go and follow him on Twitter follow him on Facebook you get all the links right there with his new website America sheriff\nDot com make sure you go and take care of that Kanye West kind of a flash in the pan I think you called him a shiny object yesterday one of your tweets that are retweeted um he was the news of the day he was ... in the White House in the oval office wearing a make America great again hat and then suddenly yesterday he didn't want anything to do with politics anymore what do you make of that\nYeah he said he was duped in the news\nOn a surprise um you know I was I I was hoping that it would show more substance that he's got to do more you and I had this conversation because you've got to do more than just show up at the White House for lunch you got to come at ground level do some of the ... or and I said I'm going to wait until he does some of the ... ... s judgment\nBut I Would I Want to people about and it's not just with Kanye West and I don't have anything against them but I heard about it but I'm a Rosa and also warned about it with Rosie O'Donnell where people in our side of the conservatives are side we glom onto these people because they said something remember Rosie o'donald said I voted for Donald Trump and everyone and not everyone\nOn our site go on the other and I said be careful there so that she stayed on T. V. show she lived and ran back the plantation started laughing conservatives blasting white men and blasting president United States almost the same thing\nAnd so or I'm a Kanye West you know I warn I just sold on a second guys and demonstrate any consistent conservative principles yeah the coolest sounds cool yeah he\nCould be a force for this when I was a little leery so when I saw this story that I saw yesterday I said I don't know why it's\nWell they say in the midst reported first by the way they said that he had a problem with Trump and he actually had a call TMZ and say fix it this isn't about the president I'm not complaining about the president but I don't want to be part of politics I guess share of\nHis issue is that Kansas owing somehow did something called black suit which is black people exiting the Democrat Party\nAnd Kanye West didn't want to be attached to it I thought that was his whole month for that you don't have to be done or a Democrat if you're a black person that you can be open to all sides why would he be against that because it wasn't as ideal what do you think is the problem\nWell if you noticed that in my other tweet I studied kind of further clarify that interest you already gave a real mixed message\nAnd that is problematic for me you know he wants to change his mind he certainly free to do that make it clear you can have one or the other one would out yeah that would appear as by now I I don't think is the\n... president United States I'm not saying that but in terms of this movement that comes with a lot of guard that comes with a lot of um you know\nArrows and sings in your back does I've been doing this for a very very long time\nAnd I know and I said you on your program what this was going to me is going to get a tax is going to be built by he's going to be a bit so rated sometimes by black people so\nAnd once he ready for it and it turns out he probably wasn't\nYeah but I I I didn't know if he had the uh the stones if you will to adore this sort of thing but I just you know we can do what do you want but he should clarify this because now I'm I'm a little ...\nYes I Am too sharp David Clarke America's sheriff dot com America's sheriff dot com go gonna read all of his articles go follow 'em and all of a social media get the book\nTop under fire all great stuff right there at the website make sure you stop by not let's let's talk about the fourteenth amendment I don't know if you and I agree let me encapsulate um what I think about the fourteenth amendment the birthright part of the fourteenth amendment I Believe is in there\nIt shows I'm going to if you're born or naturalized in this country\nAnd you're subject to the jury jurisdiction there oh you're a citizen people are are confusing the jurisdiction there of to me and for the parents\nI say it means the child wants to child born citizen the fourteenth amendment is written horribly I think you and I agree that the birthright for somebody who's\nBringing you know are coming over illegally and dropping an anchor baby should go away but we have to make it go away by ... by warning that amendment better the original intent by the senator Howard was not for aliens not for for a foreign dignitaries not for anybody who wasn't already a citizen or under the jurisdiction there up but they're rooted horribly I think it has to be changed\nDo you think that it has to be changed or do you think the way that it's wrong word it right now doesn't confirm birthright citizenship to the children\nNo we don't need to change it we don't need to change it comes to some people think the second amendment poorly written what we need to do is clarified in Congress\nAnd the Supreme Court has never ruled on the earth like citizenship\nOf illegal aliens they've never ruled there's been other stream court cases on his elbow versus Wilkins I think one of the slaughterhouse and then the other one is the uh the wrong on Kim are which dealt with people permanently residing in the United state run lead\nUs I think the long cases one Bangor hats on because that was from from Eighteen Ninety something and it did say well he's a citizen because ... and you're saying that that still doesn't go far enough we haven't really ruled on this\n... so you know we need to have the discussion then is lined up in the Supreme Court and that's okay but there's a list of understanding I think and I think it's a ... to think that the way the thing is written me all persons born\nOr in the United states but it said that second part of the second clause and subject to the jurisdiction I here's what's that mean my understanding short of what the illegal concept it\nIt means that you have an allegiance to the United states if you're in the country illegally you don't have an allegiance to the United states you have an allegiance to the nation that you came from so instead or the United states so the only legal aliens child can say well they can stay on and tells me that\nHe was born in the United states but the second part you have an allegiance to the United states you know the country illegally or he's going to I think focus on that and subject to the jurisdiction of the United states they're not going to focus on a born in the United states clause or a you know part of it\nAnd that's all they'll decide but uh the fact that the president\nHas made it clear this is part of the immigration problem by the way it is birthright citizenship universal\nPhrase people using universal Berkeley as writer and exist in the constitution however it leads to chain migration All right\nOh it does you know a new and I couldn't agree to that any by the mother has to go back when the kid is a citizen or not you're going back you broke the law dad can't come grandma can't come Tio into your can't come I I agree you and I agree wholeheartedly on that let me just say one one bit about the jurisdiction thereof\nAnd I'm not as smart as you are in your in your law enforcement guy and I'm willing to to to hear your side and I think we just sent me a lot of sense\nBut the jurisdiction thereof I think applies to the kid as soon as the kid is born let's see he's in Arizona He's in Texas He's in California\nThat child is subject to the jurisdiction there up that child doesn't know allegiance always parents now as I get that find a parent you get no right to know benefits I agree but the child doesn't know legions from this guy or this or that guy that was an Mexico Honduras or the United states so if you're on this land\nYou are now subject to the jurisdiction there up the laws of this land where you are will apply to you is what I'm saying about the child and the parents have to go back to you and I agree wholeheartedly\nYeah and I I don't know if I totally agree with that in in in a principle I Do however\nThe child can they can make that determination as to whether\nThey're in some ways you drew unless he's waving a flag when I was born I don't know [laughter]\nTake that child out of the United states anytime they want right in ... as an have any rights and we all we all know that you know why so\nYeah that would get into that a ... ... and ...\nYeah that would get into that\nA ... ... and a gray area is that what me now with the role of course a traditionally been to settle the dispute ... Supreme Court ruling on it because they have in the past ... back to the court has never ruled that\nA ... an illegal or the child or or instead of an illegal alien or the United states the automatic is that if\nYou are a hundred percent correct or using false a I'm a principles here are ... and and false a story decisis to pretend like they did rule on this but they in fact in America sheriff dot com America shark dot com share of got about a minute left me a prediction about next Tuesday what's gonna happen is there is still a lot of energy and still enough\nYou know women vinegar on our side to pull this through\nAnd I should we not too long ago I think the X factor in next Tuesday's going to be in the blue collar male is the one that's not captured by any old suburban women are going to be out there on ... involved and all that sort of thing it was a huge ... our mail or not that's what happened in ... years\nOld and capture right I think it will be okay but it's all about turnout\n... and ... to me the Kavanaugh effect still exists although not as being an as it was about a month ago I think that's still going to get people to the polls because they saw truly be unmasked Democrat Party didn't they\nWell as one demographic that was watching I suppose in more than any other and said look our mail as saw that a nearing our over some of the nation I think a lot of people including myself we put ourselves in a judge Brett Kavanaugh\nIssues that men need me agreed on a ... or so maybe that will be a factor but watch for that ... ... ... male or not\nIt's always an absolute pleasure to have sheriff David Clarke on retired Milwaukee County Wisconsin go to America's sheriff dot com America sharp dot com follow them everywhere again his book read news articles follow his tweets are amazing sharp thanks a million", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "31"}
