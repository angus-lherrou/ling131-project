I Wonder exactly um what people are thinking about the the Lone Star state because I think that people have a certain image of who we are as as Texans\nAnd I think a lot of people are surprised that a guy like a war two was so far left in so far socialist is even in the ... okay did you hear that but he has been telling people that his mother was a lifelong Republican\nYeah I heard something about that earlier today\nYeah Beto O'Rourke has said his mother was a lifelong Republican who for the first time in her life will vote for a Democrat because he's running\nMhm yeah I mean that's hard to research is no\nThis was my voted for ... just to come out there just wasn't just wondering if you do know is it or or was it ten cruising mama\nOr is this is a works mother a lifelong Republican ...\n... and voted for him\nNo I mean for for president in two thousand even she voted for um\nProbably Obama\nNo no wait a second bad though says that she's only voted Democrat or always illegal and Republican her whole life and will now switch to vote Democrat just cost her son's running mhm so clearly to president who'd you vote for\nWell then I guess you have to know Republican agenda for McCain\nAide newer right the first the rug Obama\nBefore that I mean seriously that we really we do we really have been fact checked his what he says about his mother and I guess so I don't want to I Want to take him at his word but it turns out he's full of it so yeah I mean it's being reported by the blaze that in fact uh works mother voted for\nBarack Obama got a we're not sure who she voted for twenty twelve well that's definitely who she voted for two thousand it\nAnd she's also corrected him by saying bad though\nI I'm not so that I'm a lifelong Republican I was an independent who will not vote Democrat even got the Republican Party if that was not trying to get ... votes in Texas by long about who your mom voted boardwalk ... brother ... but do that though\nI could break your we come back your phone calls a day nine four one passage Joe ... dot com ... [noise]\n[laughter] the crowd was I had them in the bottom of my ... and how to do it all morning in that and\nAnd and I won't elaborate much but Ted Cruz did make reference to a blown each do last night in your party\nUh-huh okay\nSalem I ... I have learned he learned the stove or somebody who's lived with his army definitely did winter All right so let me get the phone lines to see where you are on their side again many people watch those who can't vote for either one they don't live in the state or this was the top trained on Twitter for four hours straight\nAnd and it happened organically it wasn't it wasn't sponsored it wasn't promoted\nI'm and I'm interested in hearing what you think let me let me start in Texas however here's David David what's going on\nHey Joe thanks for taking my call ... ... so that you are real quick or you know the\nProblem you know there's like at all in the last election you know I was a cool guy the whole world and in hindsight [laughter] you know and we're glad he didn't get the nomination 'cause I don't think he would have the her\nWithout the groundswell of the Donald Trump or you know totally had I mean he he pulled out people that close but not a cold out so in hindsight it with a good thing he didn't win the nomination\nWell I think you said that they get along and that was the guy a lot of guys are going for that real conservative but I think he has a a a good shot down Trump it does get a second term but at the better thing really aggravates me that guy\nYou know I'd like to take up there with him one day just to\nGive him a poke in the ribs or something [laughter] I had just a liar he just ...\nWell he is he's met representing who he is he he and he's told many many you know a ... during this campaign if you've been listening to my show for a while you know David that I was a cruise guy from the beginning to\nAnd I'm ... and I did want Ted Cruz to get the nomination once it was through that he wasn't going to a hundred percent was going to support whoever the next person was going to be and that person became Donald Trump um I was never against Donald Trump candidates you I thought it was actually pretty cool but somebody who was not in politics\nCould could do so well and it was close man I mean Ted did very very well I mean think about it he was second place it's almost get the nomination but I agree with your your assessment I think that you needed Donald Trump\nTo beat Hillary Clinton you needed somebody who is going to fight going to roll is sleeves up and not care whatsoever about what the establishment or the or the historic or the\nUm traditional politic a politician looked like\nHe wanted to come in and say whatever you had to say to win whatever liberal jihad he would make and I think you're right he's the right guy at the right time it does crews have achieved in in in a twenty twenty four I think he does other you certainly right up there\nI I Hope he makes it in in one last thing like you know I got from it and the guy at work or whether he said yeah better than real popular name get people on the border he's from the border town yeah and he says you know he's just using that to call us back oh right you know it's real and you you said Robert scientists I think we are in the name often\nI get a kick out of your taco at all and the accents [laughter] I'll just say one thing I got when\nI go that's what I'm saying now that was good that was good I better get away so so here's the thing with um\nWith the work he wrote that ... you can correct me if I'm wrong if I ever speak out a term when it comes to an actual news item in actual fact correct me if I'm wrong they're going to court my opinion that would be a different thing but you can as well as we were getting their friends\nBut when ... wrote that that a review of the play when he was in high school or right after high school whatever it was using a late teenagers Seventeen or Eighteen years old he wrote it and what are you objectify women talking about their butts talking about their boobs wouldn't need to use as a byline\nWas it Robert Francis I don't remember\nIt was Robert O'Rourke okay he wrote it as Robert ... let me ask you something if your name is so back to that though if that's your name\nAnd that's the name to go buy at forty something years old because you've only always been known as that name\nAnd if it's such a your name that it needs to be on the ballot when you run for election something is official as wanting to be a U.S senator\nWhy wasn't that your name when you wrote some stupid article when you're in high school or college it's a good question\nI don't know I think it's a valid question and I I Would like for somebody to ask him that question when did you become ... full time when did that happen no he's always\nBeen known as the look here's a picture who weren't a sweater with his name on the front side of a sweater which I've never seen before ever I mean seriously you carry you and I've talked about as I was a donated the\nPicture yeah but but even I didn't have my name and that's one of my shirt [laughter] okay I didn't know the data that maybe on the back and they may be on board insured maybe on the Jersey what are your last name in the back of your shirt or something right right\nOkay\nIn case she forgets whose name or in case the teacher forgets what to call and let me write this on the front of the shirt man yeah yeah I got eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com back out to Minnesota Steve what's going on high\nOh hey there they love the show every day for all that you are a lot of snow banks man\nI was just wondering if there's any possibility that they could get fact checkers on these debates it seems like if they had a panel for people or something and setting off on the side and when\nAre the people debating say no no no that's all wrong with that for a fact checkers could go and\nLook up about the truth and pop it up on the side of our TV screen so we don't have to wait for the next day four papers that come out and fact check everything and then people don't see it because they don't read the paper or\nRead the news every day or hear the news\nI think it's actually a great idea I mean there's a great idea I just don't know I mean as fast as the Internet I guess you could get\nYou you could get some sort of a fact checking going during the debate but would it take away from what they're actually saying and and do the moderators do it or do you have people like ... like they had a an Internet bank last night of a bunch of people sitting there actually taking suggestions from the Internet in question for the Internet so I guess\nA bunch of people sitting there actually taking suggestions from the Internet in question for the Internet so I guess you could fact check it that fast\nI mean but then what do you do the moderator finds out that a worker Cruz just said something wrong then circled baggage and we just got our fact check and it turns out you did vote that way or or what are you saying that uh well uh I don't know maybe it would be interesting I think the debate would have to be longer do just\nYeah they I suppose they'd have to get more time that's why I was thinking if they just pop it up on the side of the screen and all this is actually what it is and then let them face the consequences the next day and have that in the in the newspaper instead of that fact checking out the next day and then people don't see it anyway\nSo instead of making it a part of the actual debate where the moderators would then go back to it you just put it up on the side of the screen on the bottom of the screen saying a ... vote was this way or crews did say that\nThat was one thought that I had I got a bad thought yeah do you say it would have they'd have to talk about it\nWell I I don't I Love and appreciate you thank you I don't think that they would agree to it I didn't cruise probably would have would have read two or three days by reading that he's ever said and done um\nBut but when it comes to work I don't see them a green to talk about you know to to accepting a fact checking that his mother didn't vote that way in fact\nAccepting the fact checking that in fact he did vote that way in the barrel of oil fact checking like when he says look we don't need a wall look it up Pashto immune to fact check could say a there's a wall or offense in El Paso so yeah I mean I think that it would be cool I mean you would you be able to that Garry\nI think I I think that's very interesting and as far as you know now that the voting and the and the oil and the ten dollar taxi wanted and Ted Cruz said no oh it's getting on my website it would've been really nice to spend money and they were fact checking during the debate and then before the debate was over\nGoing back to work and saying hey we did our homework now what what do you have to say because apparently right in that way\nI Would really like her that answer from him\nWell the weird thing is why would he used that as the example of calling Ted Cruz a liar win a war can self knows the way he voted now\nNow I now see for God God and\nI think that lives in I think that he was he was advised by whatever the hell is that ... them\nI'm call him a liar at some point bring apply in Ted that the president said oh by the way also I Wonder if those across the nation today really believe or work when he says I Can't wait to work with the president on this that and the other here's a guy that has promised to impeach the president should he become elected to US Senate\nWhat he wants to work with the president and he's using the president's words against Ted Cruz\nVery odd to me oh he was very strange editing nine four one package Joe packs dot com let's expanded a symbol take calls on this to let's expand it how would you make the debate system better I mean obviously we're better than to guy standing on the stump in a park\nOkay that's so we've been improved their\nUm ... without a doubt technology has given us the ability to support for more people to see and hear more than they ever could before but how would you make it better even further\nI think people are more interested in debates now probably started from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and maybe even from the Seventeen Eighteen people that were running to the Republican nomination people have been very engaged by debates again for the last two or three years\nSo how would you make them better how would you make it more streamlined what what would you like to see more of\nIn the debate like last night or ... who's the local news anchor and a friend of mine um who was one of the moderators last night when a work was an Easterner question

Bryan\nHow I got an email from a guy the guy in a cave in to fight them [noise] um well I mean yesterday by visiting him and said that was the size of [noise] so uh Mm\nOkay I'm Scott don't get mad at him and read the I have to read that because I Know that you've said you were going to be looking for this video or\nHe says we're feeling the same thing he just doesn't know if he's not in a good place either get imagine another winter\nA\nMayoral affected the same way by the environment is I Will stop emailing you doom porn that's not doomed porn Scott this is very important because of what happened with YouTube last night maybe your soul has had enough for now I don't know why but I'm struggling\nBecause of what happened with YouTube last night maybe your soul has had enough for now I don't know why but I'm struggling as well maybe we need to concentrate on different things or maybe got his using us like you said I don't know I hear I hear you Clyde I'm looking for it right now so he's looking for that video\nRight the video it's supposed to be a video of something hitting the moon\nOkay and and this is after I said something about the Russian scientists and the spaceship okay\nAnd YouTube shuts down and they're saying the rumor here they shut down because somebody wanted to push this video is going viral they want to stop it from going viral\nIt was a video of a man who was in uniform military saying that he had word that something was going to hit the moon and they didn't want to panic people so they shut down YouTube because of it and Scott is this list sort of mine said that he saw the video and he wanted to know if I was going to talk about I Know when he was talking about 'cause I couldn't find a video\nSo then I go to my um either my Twitter account or what other account and uh this guy says will give us hanging Clyde you know you have is hanging about this whole cluster of of UFOs that the Russians say they saw and I said\nYeah that was just one of those things or what I so I went back to try and find it today and I remember my friend Sara called me and she's saying you know what makes you think it's a U.S for a modern much what makes the Russian scientists tickets are you up our model and I thought I don't know\nSo I went back to try and look forward to that couldn't find the story\nAnd I swear I posted it short posted on my Facebook page\nAnd I have another call your mind in cars pill who he has a site called lunatic fringe though I thought he posted on his page\nAnd I can't find it\nAnd so I'm thinking well maybe this is just some massive disinformation joke campaign on the Internet but in and see if it's already it's somebody else's trying some of them\nI think this is already beginning to sound like I'm it'd be taken from a\nA page divorce and wells war of the world I mean that he was he was telling the world the aliens were landing and rovers going back in New Jersey in Nineteen thirty eight right\nI've been to grow up and smell and I I\nI really thought it was cool to go I'm a big fan of old science fiction films one of my favorite films as earth versus the flying saucers was one of ... first films or he animated classic flying saucers and we watch them destroy buildings like the nation's capital Washington Monument\n\nThe film begins with a number of strange accidents happening within many of the rockets that are being watched the film of course was released during infancy the space race and so it was alleged that the film in the film it basically it was the lead but many of the accidents taking place and failures of the satellites were the result of extraterrestrial intervention\nThrough the aliens didn't want us puny earthlings to fire rockets into the sky or use satellites to track the fact that they were planning their major invasion\nSo I was thinking about that film today\nEspecially when I was reading that some major space mishaps have been happening recently that seemed like an eerie coincident\nLike for example the Russian rockets so use MS ten failed to launch on its way to the eye assess according to a statement released by NASA\nBut so use MS ten spacecraft launched from boxing or caused withdrawing the conflicts done to the international space station of four forty am eastern stand eastern daylight time\nOn Thursday October eleventh\nCarrying American astronaut Nick Clegg in Russia in ... Alexi over chin shortly after launch there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch\nWas aborted so they had to have a ballistic lending other spacecraft\nThe launch appear to be going smoothly but Ninety seconds later NASA on his life's dream reported that a problem seem to have occurred while the booster rocket between the first and second stages of operation the space agency NASA tweeted that ballistic dissent involved they sharper angle of lending compared to normal the gaps will continue the astronaut successfully separated from the rocket booster\nAnd parachute into the ground with a rescue team tell captors ... we're actually standing there waiting for him it's also interesting to know the two NASA or two of NASA is important to space telescopes went into safe\nMode\nMeaning that something forced them into shutting down the Chandra X ray observatory\nWent into safe mode\nAnd halted all that science operations a few days after that Hubble are actually humble shutdown first toppled shut down to a gyroscope failure\nThe Chandra X ray observatory shut down a shatters transition disabled as properly and they say this is what NASA said was possibly triggered by an issue but also has something to do with its gyroscope as well so we're looking at component shutting down on the Chandra X ray observatory the Hubble Space telescope\n\nOwned by the way the curiosity Mars rover announces curiosity rover that also health and science operations it went into ... as well\n[noise] okay [noise] so we have these [noise] different\nObservatories the Chandra X ray observatory the Hubble Space telescope [noise]\nWe have a rocket that couldn't go to the IRS\nAsked because it it it went into some sort of a [noise] uh it went into some sort of malfunction so I had to come back down and then the curiosity Mars rover on Mars right now\nIt's not working eating [noise] to me it's not sending any messages back and just shut down and when to save money [noise]\nFirst of all why are they spending Ninety million dollars we don't have if there's nothing to worry about and and what about the moon bay they were they were planning on going to the moon now they have their ... over budget they're they're under a they're under a performing hair\n\nSecondly white issue a brand new planned it is intended to energize the host of agencies who can contribute to the potential ways to prevent such a disaster if if there is no disaster looming for the foreseeable future why are they doing this something doesn't smell right\nHere\nYou've recorded announced that there are more than twenty five thousand asteroids lurking out there that are one hundred and forty meters in size or greater those are the ones that pose a threat there are a lot that it poses a threat and there are ... million near earth objects that could pose a potential threat out there and so\nIt definitely makes sense to be prepared for such a disaster back in twenty sixteen though we had the planetary defense coordination so\nIf they win\nThis interplanetary Astoria apocalypse comes NASA wants to be prepared but I don't understand why overnight okay basically overnight the planetary defense coordination office just got a hundred and fifty million dollars for their budget\n\nAnd this is for asteroids okay it's an asteroid quote asteroids right so now you know why I'm feeling a little tension because we have the Russians saying they saw an armada let's say there was a dual\nStar cluster it looked like into a circus or do they do get me wrong I'm not saying there is there a modern coming okay but I say it looked like a star cluster with the Russians are saying yeah we've looked at it a little bit kind of looks like in our modern some kind of\nCar you throw that out there so I had I talked about it and be able to say I talked about on Monday show I guess I talked about that on Monday show\nMy friend Sara says yeah you did talk about because I Want to know why they think it's an armada and remember I called the ... okay you called me\nThey can't send astronauts to the highest that's because the rocket malfunction we have to X\nRay or you have the Chandra X ray telescope we have the Hubble shut down they went into ... they ... they went into safe mode there wasn't a glitch bowed wherever curiosity Mars rover it's in good boat\nYou to shut down all night most of the night\nI mean no one knows what's wrong with the rover right now just it just cropped up Saturday Night and prevents the rover from being mean to earth much of the science and engineering information distorted it's memory all this has happened keep in mind that all this has happened after the sunspot observatory New Mexico was inexplicably shut down on September Six twenty TB shutdowns\nSound very much like a precursor do some sort of alien invasion doesn't or some sort of a\nA a huge asteroid and the guy in a uniform and and ... like I said this is like a war of the world's thing this is this is a you know science fiction of course is a wonderful way of exploring where the cutting edge of science might take us in the future and there'd been numerous stories as of late the bears resemblance to many of the science fiction stories we read over time\nHowever these aren't fiction people think this is not fiction and regardless of the many decades of cover up\nHe's no longer possible to hide the fact that there's an active alerted the moment for extraterrestrial contact\n\nThe as we're looking for confirmation of alien life forms heat is difficult to hear the breakthroughs in science that have been announced with well at least those announcements which certainly confirm of life existing in space\nI mean this newfound sense of confidence from NASA and the European space agency along with several other specialist Russians of\nCourse I mean\nThey're noting that what was once considered myth\nWould they want speculated about is now finding its way into mainstream science\nMuch of what we're hearing about can be fulfilling of our lofty dreams and other discoveries are those that make up our nightmares beginner nightmares come true I mean it all depends on how you look at these major discovering\nYour own depends on whether or not\nAll of the things that are circumstantial shutting down on YouTube that telescope shutting down\nAnd several other things have happened but get too as well it just all seems bizarre just seems bizarre\nGo to Margaret in Pennsylvania Hi Margaret you're on ground zero\nClients and I called is I wanted to go from that I can hear you say about those ships\nOn that day you thought it was a\nStar cluster and all this Russian scientists thought they were ships or ... I remember that because I went on you to look to see if there was any saint ... and all I saw was there was something of a loon getting hit\nBut it was an old entry so I didn't even open it but there was another and tree that I Can't sign now that said\nIf you have something in the sky that looks like space ship it it's just a hologram say\nReally you saw something like that yeah and look I'm always I'm always looking\nOn your kids and and looking um I I was fascinated with with\nUs and face\nA spaceships and that and so I'm always looking at the different age kids won't sell it and you can how our fate and some of the two are interesting\nBut when they said this I thought oh I heard that wants to be forced somewhere like they were number if I heard it from your show or if I heard it from somewhere else that that they work\nThat the government was working on some weight to give like a hologram in the sky to a site or paypal all it keeps them in line\nOh they've they've talked about that a project will be many times before saying that you know you can make hologram and this guy to fool anybody and that's what they're saying that the thing that could be it but see this was something else this was a guy in uniform this is what was stated there was a guy in uniform that was on you to be looked official and he said\nSomething is about to hit the moon and rather than having that thing go viral it is for post speculated that YouTube shut down the channels because they didn't want that message to get out and\nWell I Can't tell you that that I Can't stay up late anymore because I have a job now they get ... I have to get up early or sell a lot of times I listen to your um hot hot cast is that how you are saying\nOr a hot hot yeah is that how you say yeah my partner\nAnd so I and when I listen to those\nOn it shorter time for me on your list and and plus I can look up things on YouTube and see if I see anything that you're talking about on you too and that's what happens when I heard you said this\nAbout the um the the possible spaceship ...\nUm that you thought just looked like a group thing stars\nSo waiting on looking for Russian scientists anything and I didn't find it and\nNeither did I I had to believe it or not I had the picture in front of me\nI had the report is Russia Today okay I thought it would be from the ... but no it's from Russia Today looking at it and I I I remember making a comment and just looking stars me say this could look like an armada came back to try and find that again no trace it anywhere on the Internet no trace it oh\nWell that's that's what I was trying to get to\nI not only ... and I find that I could find the the old hosting of something hitting the new and I couldn't find due to the talk about if\nThere's spaceships showing in the sky their fate not find any of the ... law so whatever they did they eliminate a lot of stuff not just that one\nOkay so many little I'm getting a lot of twitters tonight tweets telling me that\nOh settling to Youtube video your Facebook message you're talking about ... okay we're gonna we're gonna take a break right now um but yeah this is this is\nA weird story this is the weirdest story I think ground zeroes ever been in the middle of because of what I said a couple of nights ago and in what has transpired in the past three nights with the\nI guess I just wanted to add one of the little thing will be for our medical system where I could not sleep a night that's why I'm not listening because it's late here for me\nAre you feeling hands are you feeling tents so am I that's what I felt all day long I felt Penn it's the scariest I did my neck but in your neck\nYes it's in my neck and it and I'm feeling more more than ten I'm feeling ...\nThat's why I feel too Margaret something's going up something going down thank you recall yeah I've been feeling about all day I mean and Ron is my witness my friends are by what they know that I'd been in this anxious mood all day long we'll be back with more ground zero them go away [noise]\n\nThe interviews with newsmakers limited to return for better or worse on file for your review of WG a Doberman\nPresidential briefing on ... on jak hello and Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo has arrived back in Washington from his back funding triple the missing journalist returning\nFrom Saudi Arabia and turkey and President Trump says they'll deliver a report\nThe president dispatched to secretary to figure out what happened to columnist Jim ... he walked into the Saturday constantly ... two weeks ago and never reemerged the secretary says he's giving the Saudi and Turkish government space to complete their investigations before the U.S decides on its response ... rich and sort of the state department\nTurkey's government claims to have graphic audio recordings which they say prove cause Yogi was tortured and murdered by a Saudi hit squad President Trump wants to copy we've asked for it if it exists ... parents final column was published in today's Washington Post\nNineteen days out from the mid term elections the Fox news poll finds Democrats in general holding a seven percentage among likely voters bull also says likely women voters are leading Democrat by Eighteen points but the president's daughter in law ...

I was going to say through through um his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not that's not entirely correct and I don't want to do in the service has he be it for the ... contract quite quite openly and legitimately in through the\nThe standard contractual procedure and he goes hey large\nChunk of that I tip black but of course justice the government\nRequires that people selling their secrecy oh it's so Robert Bigelow and and um his organization had every one and a non disclosure agreement so actually the people involved in this work what kind of um stone twice\nSo to speak they had they had to have government security clearances but also the\nCommercial non disclosure agreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other\nThing in in aliens at the Pentagon and I've seen a lot of you know you pick up the the media um reports of this you go on to the blog some forms you see a lot of speculation I was always taught at the ministry of defense you know when I was\nDoing analyst way for example in briefing you must always differentiate between ... you know and what you think\nAnd that's not a skill that everyone practices when they they make films and documentaries but I Try to be\nRigorous on that and and we don't even speculating I say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so hopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know\nI'm only ... where we don't know those things\nWell what's the bottom line with what you really know what's that\nWell [laughter] I I didn't want to I don't want to get too far into spoiler [laughter] I\nI I think one one thing that I can say which I think gives a pretty good summary off off when I think has gone down\nI Would say there was and I use that would deliberately a believer faction if I can call it died within the U.S government\nAnd some of those people were coming in to employees\nAnd some were ... and this believe a fraction who the phenomenon was absolutely rail and and they were to write to not have ... didn't entirely know what to think of it\nDidn't rule out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal\nAnd actually then that believe a faction became or or certainly interacted with an overlapped with with a tip [noise] and they effectively I I guess gotten the chance to use those\nThose beliefs and those hypotheses\nThose those\nBeliefs and those hypotheses within government with taxpayers' money and and that of course gives us in\nAn interesting opportunity to find out about this because and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but now with coast talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but but the bottom line drawn to your question is is that I think there was a believer French\nThey made them move they came up again some wrote a couple of different road blocks one right below which they simply go to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigate it but because they didn't get a definitive on the feeling was but they taking it as far as they couldn't what else can you do\nThe other is to block but they had this very controversial is the hitter are cool different religious road block from from from senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for the UFOs from the paranormal with demonic\nAnd therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with that\nWell\nWhat do we\nDo we want to have anything to do it\nI mean um it it was started the whatever the it was but I as I say that there were people in the panther can probably still all who who's deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with that they don't make a demonic\nPhenomenon here I might come up come up again if there's a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was um\nUh she you know they're pretty extreme with the S. and in the the the individual who wrote that the cat to fight intelligence assessment\nOn on UFOs in the ministry of defense code name project ... he would have wanted to go too far down that road he had some slightly old\nBeliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible in the book of Asians I think it is where it refers to cite as being the print the power of the air and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious people get the idea that UFOs might be demonic\nYes and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\nYes and and it\nIt it's frustrating you know than the cause and and it's\nAlmost combing Klee ironic in another way that that you know you have a bunch of people in in the cod that the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. in the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating yet researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up against skepticism you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect um but that skepticism isn't the sort of\nNicole or intellectual or humanists skepticism that I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it's a\nDeep probably trying to believe driven skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the Pentagon um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another really these ...\nThese people were skeptical told they would believe\nThat they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more

ten year program to the last find release them go heavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nFractious um between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the\nLapses make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly\nPut yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst and and you know you that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy and they said I'm a ... and ... if you don't mind I've actually going to document in front of\nMe please give us some culture\nYeah this is this actually haven't officially been released yet I'm there will be tonight it\nWill like I'm the second in critical question is do you a piece rent present a possible threat to the defense of the realm we could argue

I defense region in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represented a threat the is the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know\nIf you ate piece represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this is quite interesting because a part of the the ministry of defense was saying\nTo parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that of any defense interest but no no no threat and yet in ... and they they were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nYou simply can't well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of\nWhat it would be if we could\nAbsolutely say that it's it's\nPhysically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and and an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course\nWe don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like about Hopkins type Jacobs where we are always\nSaying you know the whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this talk about healing and things like that and it goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean it sounds\nBizarre but in millet treat 'em\nThere is actually in a ...\nFor um working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or rather this this is a kind of them we don't know the values but intelligence some military sickles we say that threat is defined as being a construct of capability\nPlus intend so so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count whether there's a threat and if there is what ... what kind of a threat\nIt is well we have some idea about the capability of you ate pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files stay quite clearly you know pizza maneuvers way in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability\nWe we know has a higher value what we don't have any\nIdea about is intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once we it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal to march in race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to approach to try and figure this out he said it might be the analogy would be trying to explain quantum\nMechanics and chimpanzee\nWell we don't know what it is we don't know what they want what can you categorically saying that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I I don't know that\nBut I mean visitation visitation\nWell what I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you a pay a rail that they do routinely penetrate are already defined\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U.

idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S mystery is is I think you know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way\nBut but to go back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are\nA more videos that I think will be something that will come over the next\nFew weeks and months there is always the pressure going on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents have been going on for years um we have a number of pilots on the record talking about this there must be\nMany many more videos Lou Elizondo has said that there are other people involved\nIn in ... have said that there are part of course none of these people\nWant to preempt ... the the of the of the CIA and and any

totally use to UFOs flying all over the play about them and called them all means no one was afraid of the things they took them for granted it was just part of their lives so unless you're taught to be afraid of these things you're not really afraid of them\nDid they ever talked ... about visitations and abductions or anything like that did anybody ever see occupants up close yes\nThey thought he

in the town when she would go to visit her grandparents everybody would say oh you have to see the ... you know you'll love\nIt [laughter] what do you think it's not a big deal you know no well it it's a great\nPoint which is of course it goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this\nField do no I'm the idea that this phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen strange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this call and these these familial\nRecollections is is the fact that you know these these\nPhenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture and and it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this\nThis thing is is almost commonplace that it's it's like oh yeah you know that that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\nSo the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\n... real let's go to Andy in Norwalk, California now why indeed go ahead\nHi George you're agreeing patron and Mr Paulk it's a real honor I listened to many times and you're very um [noise]\nInformed and entertaining to listen to a two part question if I may uh first of all are based upon all of your knowledge of um [noise]\nThe western powers all of the NATO countries them for that matter let's say the eastern bloc countries ... approximately how many ... as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared and this guy while pursuing so called UFOs\nAnd are based upon your response I I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with part two straight away well we'll wait for that will ... will do now that they weren't one\nI'm now I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the on three is less than than a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and alternative belief communities I mean I've seen some\nPeople talk about pilots carrying missing and and your fires and I think you know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous\nUm occupational certainly was in in the early days and a lot of lot of action off just disappeared because they crashed now now of course then you have\nYou have some classic cases like a ... the mentality case he didn't disappear of course but he crashed chasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most\nFamous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes and that was strange isn't it I think we're literally don't use the way in Australia right yes\nI absolutely agree with the uh is it by trade I think the task ...\nStraight maybe the best straight is part of the past ... say excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but um but I I don't buy into the room is that that I've heard the pilots were whip\nRushing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just flew his cross into the city\nIn in I think Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later I tried to a tribute to us for\nA story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry file which was about two inches thick I went through every single pipe in filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO rumors so I think I think the answer the question is is very few\nVery soon do you okay go ahead and say oh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this uh\nAs you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the skies\nAnd uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo a stop to pursue the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese or UFOs\nOr and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich ... before he passed away huh Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes and I asked them what are the chances of\nA life or not existing on other planets and knocked coming and visiting us um and he said impossible that that was his response impossible so I I appreciate your perspective\nI Do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time and every time that they come a within our airspace there are so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years ahead of us\nThey could be entered the mention or they could be physical or both but I don't think we're much of a match and they do have air superiority\nAnd [noise] I Do appreciate the honor and pleasure but talking to both of you\nIn the Persian and well said by the way and\nAnd and he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence is Aspen project ... and that was a I\nHave I don't like to call it amusing\nBut ah I it was kind of poignantly amusing maybe the there was a line about the flight safety and safety implications off you ate Pete ... which goes directly\nOf of course to the point just made and there was a recommendation in ... combines final report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but effectively a pilot's encountering you ate pay should take no action\nApart from trying to place the object is done in other words\nYou know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with that\nNo mess with it at all we're going to take a break pretty soon that can come back with funnel phone calls but I also want to talk with you you've done a thriller out called blood brothers don't you\nYeah I Do a\nKind of a different thing for you\nYes I I'm a big although I'm best known for having\nRun the UFO program I did a lot of other things in my Twenty one years at the MIT and my final posting within the direct threat to\nDefend security we did a lot of counter terrorism and things I've written fiction before I've written to fight fight novels about alien invasion\nSo I decided to write to a thriller about terrorism and counterterrorism and the intelligence agencies it's our turn Kendall now and ah it it's going straight to a paper by on I think November fifteens\nGood lord

action thriller called blood brothers and how do you get the book Nick\nWell its own candle at the moment I'm a I'm coming out in paperback in November but it's on Amazon say say basically I just don't give it to Amazon and look up blood brothers Nick Pope or it's on late Nick ... website on the books\nSugar in your opinion uh assuming we're being visited do you think most of them look like these so called de Leon grazed that people described or do they look like gosh what do you think\nWell tricky question because I think the media kind of might have this\nThis kind of trope on me or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think um you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens gray large head\n... shaped it gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage\nBut in my experience when people report and she's just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nAre always sure do what you but you saw almost saying then that people basically they hear this they hear this and then they think they see it\nYes I think perception plays a big part in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by a civilization in let's face it the universe is nearly fourteen billion years old\nImagine what a civilization which you say a million years head start on us money to be able to do in terms of you know hiding themselves masking their true appearance deception ah it it's unimaginable so so again I think we're in the ... century where\nWhat we watch what we think we see perceive may be very different\nFrom the reality of what's going on and it may ultimately be unknowable to us ... sees that our town level of development\nWhat's your thought of the propulsion system that\nWell it's it's clearly a community going to be some something exotic I guess we're in in sort of\nStar Trek parrot tree and in one sense of some sort of ... light travel again there are some theoretical physicists working on this sort of thing trying to figure out whether it would be paying\nSpace time whether it would be using wormholes I suspect gravity is going to be the key to this um gravity I guess of all the fundamental ... is the one that we\nKnow at least to bow often and therefore it's the one where we are perhaps more likely to make quantum leap breakthroughs in terms of of science and technology\nThat's going to the phones again let's go to Alex in Rochester New Hampshire to get things started Hi Alex welcome to the show\nI think you have a question of her new hope um I Hope to practice it with a little bit of a personal experience um I saw a when I Would call a UFO I'm On there for two thousand Thirteen and print town in New Hampshire but how do you want twenty miles west of a Manchester\nAnd I consider myself a politically and religiously liberal not conservative at all and I'm clean and sober but gr had a definite um [noise] really evil vibe who a real I don't I Can't say for certain it was demonic but it really had a very negative by who is the whole experience [noise]\nVery scary very creepy had a very predatory feel that you believe that it's possible that some of the in pelican extraterrestrial visitors 'em might possibly be either evil or negative possibly demonic not all of them but maybe from\n\nI again I think it takes us into the territory of water are we dealing with even if we didn't leave some something real do we really know what it is\nWhat are we dealing with even if we didn't leave some\nSomething real that we really know what it is could can we really are a scribe human emotion to it the problem with all of this if we\nCan only comment this from a ... point of view and we tend to to be kind of\nYou know very black and white I think you know our thinking sometimes we see it in politics we see it in religion you know it's glass half empty glass half full good aliens by aliens\nAnd and you know one has to wonder does this actually come from whatever it is that you're interacting with well does it come from your own cultural background belief system\nSection may be influenced by by documentaries that was science fiction or whatever it it may be I I don't I don't like to take anything off the table I mean I I I tried to be open minded with all of this and\nI think earlier in the show I said that there is unlikely to be one single neat solution to the usa mystery so I think you know when you ask me what might be out there I don't think if there are other civilizations and the cosmos which I firmly believe that there are\nI don't think it's going to be quiet you know there's just one of the civilization um therefore you know are they good are they died I suspect\nIf we share this cause most we share it with with a whole bunch of different civilizations which which may have absolutely different\nPoints on the moral spectrum if I can call it that um I guess the late person's way of saying that would be you know there's probably\nGood aliens out ... I'm Out choice steak extraterrestrials and and\nEvil restless yeah with with the various intentions\nWas no question about it in you know I'm so convinced that in this vast universal bars and maybe even the multi ... that the prime more more you'll shoot is the same\nWherever you go you're going to have the same elements the same complexity you may have water you may not generally you probably will if you're close enough to you store your son\nYou're going to have things heat up a little bit I think there are millions civilizations throughout the universe the big question is how did it start and you know let's take religion out of it you have to do that for just a moment\nWhat what do you think was the cause the jumpstart for life\nI have no idea I mean I think it's if if you throw nobody knows you know\nIf if you throw the dice trillions and trillions of times they eventually maybe it'll it'll\nCome out right but but much smarter people than me with relevant experience in biochemistry and and ... related field have have no idea frankly they they have some hypotheses but we haven't yet manage to\nTo create biological life I think I'll be controversial I think we'll

they do their deal and they'd ask what kind of legislation to ask for legislation and hope that Congress would reenact it\nBut then they got to this point where they said\nWe need to do such and such because Betty Jones Betty stand up and Betty would stand up and they tell the story and then at some of them are heart wrenching there is no doubt about that but I ...\nI suppose that analysts must have looked at it and said somewhere there's a blind square all over the fence said we need we had that vote as\nWe need we need to do better what we need you to do is give the story about the blind squirrel and that's going to win Nancy over\nYeah and I knew in Texas I think more people probably just shoot\nThe ... right I'm going to eat and then you you\nHave to keep trying to get in my house

will please update us on the caravan heading this way for thousands strong and growing from Central America\nFrom Fox News hundreds of migrants who reportedly had broken away from the care and then moving to one of my life I now said to be at that country's border with Mexico just hours after President Trump issued a warning and he may ask the military to get involved and officials there can't stop this onslaught migrant shelter in Qunu mine on the Guatemalan sites\nCan't stop this onslaught migrant shelter and take Qunu mine on the Guatemalan side of the border imported Thursday\nAnd now it's gone [noise]\nWell that's what it does I'm hanging out there in front of the left and telling you the lenders hand on tree out making your new stories go away\nA migrant shelter and the Guatemalan side of the border and border today hundreds of Hondurans and the caravan of about four thousand have already made it there\nAnd the rest of ... hours behind in Guatemala City as a caravan appear to be the first thing in some parts migrants are hopping on buses and hitching rides instead of journey northward on fun but it's unclear whether those who made the farthest will try to enter Mexico immediately or wait for others and they can attempt a mass crossing\nVideo circulating on social media reportedly showed hundreds of migrants many wearing backpacks walking on foot and the Mexico Guatemala border town Mexico's already sent a simple east to the boards me the migrants\nAnd that anyone would travel documents in the correct visa will be allowed to pass on some others and the group can apply for refugee status officials also cautioned that those who tried to cross into regular man or\nCould be detained and deported\nAnd now a showdown which according to Trump could become a matter for the U.S military Mexico can't stop the caravan in addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over the population I must in the strongest in terms ask Mexico to stop this onslaught\nAnd if an able to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border Trump tweeted Thursday morning\nAnd Trump's latest threat against the caravan which originated in Honduras in his bound for the U.S in the bed to escape prevents the poverty and violence come to the secretary of state Mike Pompeo has to Central America to discuss the issue\nSo that the simple question is what to do what would you do and and I guess the secondary question to me who do you think is funding them and financing them\nI think the leftist ... is is so backward in so anti this country and our our traditional values I think there are so against any border whatsoever when you've got people like visual work I Do for some Texas saying that we recently took half of Mexico um\nThere's no doubt in my mind that goes on the left and far left or the ones who are supporting and promoting this you'll also look I have seen some interviews with people that are in the care of him\nAnd there'd been translated I don't speak Spanish well enough to understand it as as people are speaking out as they go and break it down and read a little bit but I'm seeing a translated people showing up or we want the American dream we want a better job we want a better life\nThat's what everybody wants to not get better I mean I understand that that makes sense but that's not a refugee that's somebody seeking refuge from sudden certain death\nFor their families or their wife and kids that somebody who should apply to do it legally that somebody who should apply to come here to be a productive member of the American society and we we enjoy people like that we want people like that we employ more people like that to come here but when you're being interviewed and you're telling me that you're ... you're going to come here and you're going to request political asylum\nAnd the reason why you came years for the American dream it a better job\nThat's not the same thing you're not somebody who should get asylum you're not somebody who needs asylum you're not somebody who's seeking refuge is just like the lady with the child a three year old that was the poster child it turns out she took her child away from her husband and our doors who's got a great job as a truck driver or something\nThere was no immediate needs you just want to do\nAnd it wasn't the first time that you've taken whose children from him without them knowing it without his approval so the idea that these are people in dire straits\nThese are people who need political asylum or they'll be killed for speaking you know their mind um there'll be killed for being a certain race or ethnicity or religion none of that's going on these are people who just want a better job\nAnd do it on down are spent my entire life trying to get a better job and expand what I Do\nI agree with them but I Want you to do it legally I don't think\nThat I should be able to break into the border of Canada or Mexico and said I'm here because I Want a better job and then they have to go up there and it got to get asylum oh no they have to do is tell me to go home and do what the legal way there's nothing wrong with that in fact it's extremely right just and it's the right thing to do\nSo I I\nI Am Ninety five percent sure this is far left wing maybe even show rose funded because they think if they get here by the election that this will rally Democrats and those who want open borders and want illegals this day to go and vote and go and vote left it would be ridiculous for Republicans me by Mitch editing nine for one\nWhich is all the more reason that we need all the Republicans support we've had in Congress\nThat is a Laura Trump but really great to talk to you if your brother in law I asked them ... I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm I'm guessing the family got at first\nI'm going to actually do this ... jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process what it looked like\nYour father in law was really going to take the stuff\nYeah\nIs your thought process what it looked like your father in law was really going to take the stuff\nYeah I actually that all of us down\nAnd said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous ... birthday during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise up\nBut but I I that I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law and do this job he's a businessman he is so smart when it comes to negotiating wouldn't have been able to do in in so many different respect what hair of trade 'em\nReally great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepare you for for all of this um it it it's so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president\nAnd get to pack every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of ... here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because\nI really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history of one of the greatest presidents country's ever had\nA disagree with that it's Laura ... her husband was there with her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty sixteen or because you can send it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the media would come after the love to come after you does but not like this\nAnd I asked him was completely unexpected he said no I knew that they were trying to go hard on me and probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice\nFor thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on the television and radio show so he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well just they lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this\nJune ... when was the realization for you in the family that this is way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I actually know for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because I Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would claim thing going and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said that um that\nThat was it it it was very clear wine to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for her forever if you know he became president wrote but um\nBut certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant they they attacked my unborn child needs to make the auditors are idiots so crazy\nBut again I think it's because they knew before\nThat I'm trying to think came president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life is going to come to an end though\nUm I have to say that it it's just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys will you have the ... family members you to my wife is Laura Trump or his or her husband her father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean white the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people go and vote\nIn Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent he was doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your brother in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama are saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided touches but under the surface those you know\nThese are far left wing socialist is going to war you look at places like Michigan were Debbie Stabenow has been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now you got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show the ... seat this really used gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the ... votes which really what it is is it\nOh absolutely well as I think you're right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling to stay in painting I Will be in your neck of the things like this on Monday youthful I Will be onto your day ironically and Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them to think about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit people behind him that voted on by\nThe president and and really pushing the agenda forward we can do much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what socialism look like look at Venezuela right now that\nCould become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening socialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that\nShould shock everybody to a degree that you knew not only are going to get out into the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote on\nIt very area and\nKnow that it felt like a fight and twenty pain to get Donald Trump elected in ... he certainly was the fight isn't over you and you can't get back you can't relax we can't be complacent me happy to get out and got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nIs running if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to your shoes are delicious used his wife is from Venezuela who tells the story of how disgusting who's there I mean there are people waiting in line for foods and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first\nIs made him in a country could lose her with it and you really do have people in this country or tells you ... you got people who are actually showing this guy doing in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nLower or squash and I really appreciate your time and by the way of luxury Minnesota we reached Asian generally we're very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul entity okay they're hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left urging voters should will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts and take more of your money away and we'll drive jobs out of the country that's what they're running on and the centers there almost fifty fifty right now and almost every poll you see\nWhat is it that we're doing the wrong you went to Iraq you know done junior the president's the the Fox News released what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that is crazy to me\nWell I don't know Joe that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the whole word ... great point\nBut I don't really think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid\nTo tell a pollster that call them or coaches them on the street that they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood and done such a a number on on people whenever they come out in support of the president or as a Republican\nI'm so I think it does make people a little ah hesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth whenever no one else is looking\nWhen they think about the ... really come in this country in almost in less than two years under President Donald Trump through and they think about their children in the future of the country I really think that they're going to vote Republican and um\nEach of the country I really think about how like I'm\nOut in the matter of getting people out and encouraging people to get out and vote Arlen here\nKnocked or make phone calls everybody you know about you know I'm On the road from now until November that I had a Thirteen month old son but when I was a lot of them out with him but because of hand and the and I like a teacher and being the ... the MBA perhaps I'm Out here and doing that and and my important company doing\nAnd that's when beautiful baby
