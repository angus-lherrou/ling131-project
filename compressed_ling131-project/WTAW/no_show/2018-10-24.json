story on the blaze that also I think comes from the Daily Caller\nAnd uh it's about who's in this caravan there have been allegations that there are other than Central Americans in their other than Mexicans in there so who's in there a\nSpanish language network reporter reveals who was infiltrating my current caravan heading to the U.S that's the headline from the blaze written by Carlos Garcia a reporter with the Spanish language network Univision revealed that he had met people from a Muslim majority country or infiltrating the migrant Caribbean from on doors headed towards the U.S border\nQuote they infiltrated themselves in this caravan Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana was reporting from a bridge in Guatemala where the migrant caravan was attempting to cross into Mexico underway to the United states Santa Anna said he had himself met people from Bangladesh\nSo interesting the Daily Caller reported a translation\nOf sand and his claims us reporting from Mexico the borders and Central American I guess they mean Central America are not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama\nAnd Ecuador to cross easily Santa Ana explained across from Costa Rica\nThan later go through Guatemala and eventually make it into our country yesterday when we were traveling from Guatemala you said we noticed people from El Salvador and even people from Bangladesh she continued then you manage what the imagine what they had to do to get here he said they infiltrated themselves in this caravan\nWhich would imagine what they had to do to get here he said\nThey infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross the crowd that would have benefited them greatly Senate and the continued to say that they were identified detained by immigration officials Mexican officials appeared to listen to president Donald Trump demands to stop the caravan from arriving at the U.S border region reports indicate that some visuals are eating the migrants on their truck\nMexican ambassador to the U.S admitted Thursday and Fox News\nAnd they believe the caravan to be at least partly politically motivated we have evidence that this government is also a very much politically motivated investor deer or said we're obviously sensitive to the military situation that we encounter and we're acting precisely said but we've also made it clear that there is no legal ground on which Mexico can issue a permit\nBy which people can just go through Mexico towards the United states he concluded well why are they still come and then if that's the case why are they still underway here\nWe come on\nAnd the reason is because either in Mexico doesn't love his own country and it does\nYou see the soccer matches where people are all screaming yelling Mexico and waving Mexican flags does not have been all of their own country they just don't think they they should have to worry about it they think that we have more so we should have to worry about it for some reason we're on the hook and I just don't understand that\nAny day nine for one pack Joe packs dot com Senator John Cornyn at the bottom of the er make sure you keep it

starting here I think this is a perfect storm and I think that the sheriff earlier complicated a little bit but I think he's even in the dark on what I Believe this worry okay\nWhat is is these are are in mixed up with military eight eighty percent better I'm saying okay I've been watching the road\nAnd eighty percent better as military aged okay Fifteen to thirty\nThirty five okay that's happening now they're picking them up and pick up some trucks OK and load them up they're coming quicker now I Believe this is a plan and I think the last they now gone so far they are with chai calm they're being a ate it and\nThe money's coming from the ... and Russia and everything communist in South of this I Believe this is a red dawn ... that guy's boss he says it the other guy\nCalled before him that said it was an invasion he's more right than he no\nWell I I agree that there is an attempt now to see how far they can get in and it's going to cause the president\nNow there'll be added on there's hundreds of training camps are going to be coming out of the\n... if it's the talk shows there and if it keeps on growing that's going to make this point even more salient the president now\nWhen you use ... hold on hold I ought to honor the band respond back anyway or the president now has the opportunity\nTo do something is the executive in chief as the commander in chief\nHe now she used that this is not just some gaggle of migraines hoping for a better life right this is actually now like fighting age men veteran predominant in this caravan and this hordes of people\nAnd he's gonna have to do more than just put physical presence there without arms you're gonna have to put people they're looking at and physically fight people if they have to we have to make it clear that the border means something\nGo let me just say this please it's going to not the enemy is here fifty percent of the country okay they're here the child comes in here by thousands soldier's okay they've already\nSet everything up all the the ... east coast where they're going to come from everywhere every communist country everything because the lip now knows they don't have anything to do on this like they know they've been found out they don't have anything going on\nAnd ... have a civil war that is happening but still the veterans know what I'm watching it bad\nI'm I'm telling ya I'm seeing it clearly this is the red dawn we've all been bearing and we're looking right at it but we're going to come up with everything else what really is happening everybody\nThere to get ... well they'll do it on the left might say that the writers and saying that him and the majority of middle American you know we're not going to we're not we're not going to sit back and watch your Jeff were not naive as why we're having conversations like this or not and I raised my friend who's in office but I Know you've that's our military is getting stronger faith very like I like I let you go\n... and I love Jo look just like crazy very complimentary\nLovett Jeff love it I Can't just let you go for a minute to not say anything they actually pay me to do the show but I Do love it it's a eighty eight nine four one package Joe ... dot com line three or four is going to be Fe in Kansas right what's going on about a minute\nAgo I guess if you or is it that this campaign sure I had to take it like a new world war two where at it is\nAnd it and I gather\nLA any real and well at least thing is getting a little tired rapid village\nWhile I think there has to be there has to be some sort of a force waiting on the border so that people coming here can't you know like phone back and say hey they didn't stop us at all did you come on up because they bend you'll have millions of people\nHeading from you know from lower income uh countries from ... from South and Central American countries in from Mexico itself to come into our borders we we have to make sure we dissuade them as they get closer and that's that's really important but\nIt really is it's vitally important that we actually dissuade them we can't just say hey welcome\nMurray New Jersey I've got about a minute Murray they're going to happen\nYeah a chow also I watch the blaze a blank back and I agree with him a lot he says that these are mocks his\nCommunist that are coming to our country and they want to get rid of the western civilization completely now I also heard someone say mentioned like a solution for the president that fell on the books and I think if the Congress alien act\nGranting oppressing you know the full power to control something like this and and John Adams a president does it back then and it's still on the books I don't know if you can get in touch with that Ted Cruz I someone regarding that but our president cannot like these people and\nI'm with you Maria with you I don't know about the alien actually you're talking about I don't have that in front of me but certainly as we continue this I talk to every member of Congress I can I'll talk to the president if I can we've got to find out what exactly is going to happen with those because people listen you're the last few phone calls people are scared to death\nUm he in every debate so far John has brought you name up like you're on his side like you would have more together he really has I mean I don't know if you've seen the like I've worked with John ... Senator John Cornyn I and I and John Cornyn so I Do you think\nI I'm I'm sure this is what he's doing but I Wonder if you agree but he's trying to tell moderate those people lean to the right a little bit moderate down the middle moderate to the left a little bit don't worry I'm not the radical they say I Am John Cornyn Scott ... got my back\nWell I I I'm ... dead as you know and I do believe that they do is a radical when it comes to the policies that he is espousing he is a is a\nQuintessential national Democrat yeah which means he's profoundly out of step with the Texas values in Texas voters on everything from immigration to impeach the president from around the base abolishing eyes\nUm all of these radical positions that are being a spouse at the national level so says he's four and I guess I have to give him some credit for his candor is he uh is he a\nPleasant guy a yes is he a charismatic yes is he somebody that I ever\nWill be willing to work with where we find common cause on improving our ports of entry and trade 'em but but I certainly think he's the wrong choice or a protects us and we certainly don't need another vote for Chuck Schumer to be the potentially next majority leader of the United States Senate\nAnd that's exactly what he would be he's been clear that he would be bad news also made it clear that\nThat he's sort of be a bit new you know Obama two point oh he's the guy that's on him when he met the guy that some of the late night shows he's the guy that\nAs you said is bringing charisma but not really talking about not outlawed anyway what he would really do as you very far left wing senator from the great state of Texas when you see this much money flowing in from outside of our state does that give you concern\nAbsolutely absolutely\nThis is this new phenomenon you're oh I've never seen this before where you have an incumbent senator and a red state like Ted Cruz who's done a good job who um and seeing unprecedented amounts of money coming from all over the country in the small donations that are raised over over the Internet\nAnd it's it's a it's a sobering thing because ah to have an incumbent red state senator being out raised and outspent by his opponent is a is something we've never seen before\nThirty eight million dollars he's raised it's more than any senatorial campaign ever John should we take a look at a at the availability of people from outside of be the given state\nTo send money in I mean I'm not a big regulation guy I'm a low tax guy but I mean if California orange ... wherever you live ten injected this much money into races in our states or counties in our cities I mean who's one of the joint\n[noise] but it's a good question um and a good point I had actually had somebody bring that up to me just a few moments ago after a rally with Ted Cruz in a in a Williamson county\nI'm just north of Austin right and you know we don't allow people from foreign countries foreign nationals to contribute to our national elections from I think that's a legitimate question why should people from other states be able to inject\nTheir money into a race or that for ... whoever will represent the state of Texas such a good good point good question we ought to pursue\nIts a Senator John Cornyn senator you been a great supporter of the military or even a great supporter of lower taxes lower regulations we're seeing more exports of oil from Texas than the importance I mean what what things are looking really good the idea that we would ever handed to the other party is one that makes me crazy um how do you feel going in\nI I feel like maybe the Senate gains two or three seats but we've got to get people out to vote and the house really is up for grabs if the house goes the other way the tax cuts to point to go away tax cuts for middle class families goes away and the economy probably start slowing down how are you feeling going\nWell you're right because Nancy Pelosi will be a driver and we know that you know a ... year alive or the or find\nCommon cause with President Trump on or anything so I think\nBasically Congress will shut down by and large for the next two years\nExcept for we maintain the majority of the Senate which I'm optimistic we will do will continue to be able to confirm good judges like judge Kavanaugh judge\nGorsuch and the other eighty two\nFederal judges that we can firms so far right but I I'm I'm traveling to ah ah to Dallas a on Thursday or Pete Sessions race there is on the on the line on the bubble and then that John Culberson in Houston John quarter in uh in Williamson county where I just left right I'm all of these are very close\nRaces and so that's why it's so important that your listeners get out and vote\nIn each of these congressional races because it's not just Ted Cruz is not just ...\nIt's these down ballot races that could determine or who is the next speaker of the house or in the house representatives in two thousand Nineteen\nSenator John Cornyn couple of quick question senator of first of all walking Castro who is a I think district twenty ... a Democrat from\nI'm from the great city of San Antonio you know him you know his brother I mean this guy is a far left wing radical guy who just a few days ago I actually alleged that that Jared Kushner gave a hit list to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and then the crown prince took action that's Micah show used dead\nWhen the U.S representative says something so stupid he's trying to back away from it now but when he says something\nWhat a U.S representative says something so stupid he's tried to back away from it now but what he says something so stupid I mean is there anything that can be done legislatively in the house can be censured can I mean you don't say something like that that the president's son in Law Order the death of somebody\nWell I don't think it was an accident and I think it was probably premeditated unintentional but I Can't think of anything more reckless or a member of Congress to say than to accuse somebody or something like that without any evidence whatsoever I'm it it it's a disgrace\nWell mostly in the audio and said he didn't say it but we've all seen the video he definitely set it\nYeah well it's it's unfortunately it's one of those political issues that I think is going to be decided at the at the ballot box you know there's probably not a whole lot anybody could do I'm beyond that but I certainly would encourage people\nTo remember this and I'm In a way they think is appropriate you know a in this race that's just not something that ought to be rewarded with the support\nI couldn't agree more now the last thing has to be the thing that everybody's keeping an eye on is this caravan of two thousand to five thousand people heading north\nI'm a these are not people who are looking for or need political asylum when their question these are people that say we just want to get a different job a better job maybe a better life and I get that I mean everybody wants a better job in her life but that's not somebody who gets political asylum generally speaking our friends who ... aren't doing as much as I think they possibly can do\nAnd this also you're not going to like send out a Twitter message to everybody in Honduras hail its head north this is obviously something that was that that was put together by somebody on the left there's video out there that I've seen where people are handing money to those who are getting ready to jump onto this caravan with his horde of people\nDon't what can be done I mean we can't have four thousand five thousand people break from our border illegally and all claim asylum at the same time what can we actually do\nWell I I think the president is right that this essentially you would be tantamount to an invasion\nOf the United states and the president has Ortiz as commander in chief to rip repel any invasion of the country you know this this is what I think again you mention a left over playing the cabin out this is another example of that I Believe\nWe're all sympathetic to people who who would like to immigrate to the United states for a better life right but we don't believe that they should jump ahead of line the line of people who are doing it awfully and and waiting in line\nAnd so this is another example of kind of a mob controlling our orders in our policies and we we cannot let them limb uh there is a legal way for people to get their case hurt before an immigration judge and it ought to be handled that way\nUh I like the way Senator Cruz mentioned it it I think there was that the first the debate he had with ... you said they said the difference between ... so working me is I Believe in legal immigration not illegal immigration exactly and this seems to be encouraging illegal immigration\nA senator I thought that you've been an amazing job with a juicy under the Judiciary Committee when it came to cabin on a thank you so much how you were you represent our state and really do it it was amazing yesterday speaking in front of that horde of very excited to Republicans conservatives Texans in Houston great job I rose appreciate jumped thanks\nThank you Joe good to be with you back\nAfter this is the Joe ... show stand right here [noise]\n[laughter] ... yeah [noise]\nHave you taken my

been damn caravan I Will say yes to that e mailer and I should have done the bumped bumped balls or whatever the hell I'm supposed to do should have done that too and maybe even some harmony but I did it 'cause I thought that people wanted it today\nWell and if for some reason you go back and you would just send you add those oh boy I'm just saying I think the other thing you could add is when you said something about so close and you can join the sun goes some plans\nAnd that when they could probably do that to us than it was ... so you're starting to get off the air it's when I go back and redo even more of that song\nI didn't know what I'm going to be filed I might actually vote no assets on actions that you need probably doing a commercial break him in and why can't because somebody's

Louis [noise]\nYou are listening to ground zero [noise]\n... viruses that are there to paralyze children have had no viruses that are out there to do normally kill people that are killing children killed six New Jersey [noise] and last night I was talking about [noise] the second genesis and I was trying to\nExplain and\nAnd I guess it was more difficult than I thought because you know you know it's not beyond the proper limits of thought to actually declare\nBut there are life forms that are unrelated to life as we know it because they are descendants of an independent origin of life\nMeaning that we have genesis eating the beginning and we have a second genesis on the side of the beginning\nEither left or right we have both sides simultaneously giving birth to entities parasites viruses diseases\nAll of these things were created or somehow manifested and their job of these parasites were to cutting Tammany\nThe blood line that was given demand directly from God the whole point of the garden of Eden right the whole point of the garden of Eden was\nThe snake came in and the serpent came in and wanted to contaminate the bloodline and ever since that has been someone and they want to contaminate the bloodline making man less of a man last human and more demonic more\nJust beyond the limits of man I mean many scientists argue there's no reason why a second genesis might not have taken place and no reason why is this and that should not still be living among us this would mean that there could be an alien life former life\nWell dare I say a form of life that exists\nWhose main purpose is to invade a healthy host and proceed to Rob it of its life force and its ability to think and function within the norms of society\nThe same can be said for entities or even life forms that can inhabited building like a house or or perhaps a a place where a murderer suicide to play it it can be said that these entities\nCan be in your food or even can find their way into your home giving you the impression that perhaps your house is haunted by pulled her guys or some other pesticides and I've been\nReally really really into the show right now there's a show hunting uphill house I've been watching Netflix and I'm really enjoying the way\nThese new horror shows are more psychological and deal with the darker areas of the soul that tend to be exploited\nIn times of trauma devout trauma trauma sets off it sets off\nThe chain reaction to bring this parasitic evil into play trauma and dread seemed to water down the soul and make it right for hysteria fear it even possession now when I say possession\nI could mean demonic possession or or now you can also\nPut forward the new theories that are being presented and that is demonic possession is actually a parasitic condition that still remains undecided and this keeps it in the rooms with the paranormal but it stop just short of being a parasitic infections spreads because of blood trauma to the consciousness\nBlunt trauma to the immune system brings about add new viruses in Gerald viruses paralyzed kids kids that are sick kids die kids that are die from these parasitic infections\nOkay\nAnd hell knows what other parents that get infections can come into your home you know your home is like a human your home is like I mean it's\nGot a a a system of pipes like veins water is going through the house it's got a uh it's got a brain system thermostat it's got all these other things that you control it's like controlling another environment\nOkay so our house can be haunted a body can be haunted by some sort of a virus that can keep it in ... that can be kept in hurting the body and then eventually it develops into some full fledged demonic possession it's like a demon wants to get out\n\nA demon wants to get out and it will kill you in the process\nThe dark side is very real [noise]\nThe dark side of the reason why it had no virus that normally doesn't kill children kills children it's a reason why an ... virus is causing children to be paralyzed is the reason why people are dying of symbol diseases they wouldn't normally die of a meat is crawling into their bodies from water something is rising I tell you\nIt's the darker end of the second genesis is around you it's coming it's happening to a lot of people as we see it and it could be responsible for something that will pro long into the sixth extinction\n\nMax was good friends with actor Orlando blew me lived in the United states for a few years he had returned to the u._k. to stay with his mother before getting off the polling\nAnd he was probing the lives of well known figures in politics business entertainment\nIt was sad that he was about ready to uncover some secret pedophile group\nOnce again something that harms the children\nIs on his wing death the subsequent treatment of the authorities as many online followers convinced\nThat he was killed by some strange spell or curse some say government agents but you know the habit the way it is and um to look back at what we were talking about last night\nTalking about the uh\nSecond genesis what's going on in the other dimensions what's coming through from the other side of course you know trauma is what triggers all as we've been going through a lot of trauma lately\nAnd\nWhen you're looking at trauma and you look at how it affects people in these horror films in fact Halloween came out when so Halloween over the weekend and that is about trauma as well as about trauma family traumas handed down for forty years\nRight it was a ... Myers the woman who was killed by Michael Meyers\nAnd then you have the strode Z and you have you have the Jamie Lee Curtis character that's actually now you know older she's no longer teenage babysitter she's older now and she's been waiting for the moment where she can confront Michael\nAnd you know this is kind of like blow of all the other sequels this is the one that they should have just waited and did it forty years later because it it it certainly is a well done film\nAnd shows the trauma is something that activates activates a lot of behaviors\nWhether it be the protective behavior such as what we see in the movie to protect their behavior of the mother the grandmother\nAnd the predatory behavior brought along by Michael\nAnd\nWe wonder you know what possessive and in fact that's one of the things what possesses the predator to go after the prey and what possesses the prey to protect itself from the predator\n\nI mean we are perceiving the world today is being hostile and in some cases in a state of otherworldly control and with the prevailing eschatology and the protections of the world apocalypse\nWe're witnessing a critical mass of individuals giving up are becoming antagonistic because\nAll they hear about is how their future is going to end in a biblical cataclysm we had earthquakes six point something or other off the candidate coast British Columbia Canada that we had these earthquakes\nThe news the other day talking about another fault line near Mount Hood here in Portland here in Oregon right\nI'm having people writing me and telling me Clyde it's been shaking Vancouver\nIt's going to start shaking Seattle and then it's going to shake Portland get out of Portland not only that we have the riots in the streets that only wherever the shootings there my home we now have earthquakes waiting\nAnd people keep telling me Clyde remember what the school said remember what the cube said remember what the school and the ... I'm going back and I'm going to listen to that show again I Want to know and try to remember what the cube set in what the skull was saying through the cube\n\nIs a lot of people are telling me that what was said with the black Cuba or San Francisco is transpiring now I'm going to go back and I'm going to do the research to find out just what's going on\nAnd we'll get down to the bottom of whether or not that Cuba was speaking and that's the goal was telling us what is happening what is going on\nThe one of the biggest ally that people will tell themselves in that ah it's okay you know faithful pulled me through I'm All right I'm good it's okay but see I don't think that I mean it you know they they they have the faith while things are good\n\nThey have the faith because they're not being there not the ones in the crosshairs they're not in the ones being played by the demons where are the ones being played by the parasitic\nInfestation of a dead know add new viruses or or or a general viruses or planes or pistons\nToday they were saying oh ah what ... what is the most ah what is the most a pervasive demon shows up by the ... who shows that we used ... whose positions are ... is the demon uh pet stolen\n\nThe demon the pest ones is the demon shows up on ... so so ... ...\nIt was the same team and that showed up in The Exorcist captain how easy it was the same demon that apparently show up in the entity investigation\n\nSo yeah you can tell you though I have faith everyone's going to be fine but then you know when things get to the point where they're ugly there are people they're secretly dreading the advent of death or hell or of course the permanent and with no chance of rebirth re mortality\nAnd of course these are prompting a chaotic time it's sick cat I thought some several attribute yeah they'll tribute them to ah the prompt things have the devil or daemon I mean even goes from a confidence strict started the betray or of those who\nGives into the temptations of robbed them if they're hurt you and we're seeing that people who used to love life begin to lose their zest for life and we begin to see children thinking about suicide\nThe thing about killing playmates we're hearing about children who are sexually assaulted by other children and we're hearing about bullying and how those who are bullied have an audience on YouTube saying goodbye and some say in their lives for all the see social media has become a demon unto itself\nAs unseen algorithms are guiding people are becoming ruthless to each other highly behind the shield and the keyboard that dark side apparently is winning over many people and we wonder if it's evidence of the magnum opus or Satan that something is breathing a new psychopathic ideology where the end result will be our own destruction\n\nScientists are calling it as easy as they're calling it a disease and yet the disease has not been detected under a microscope ... microscope\nAnd and so the technocrats have to dig a little deeper their questions defining and sequencing the consciousness of human beings both the river inside the humble parts and the parts that are darker and chaotic\n\nPart in the parts that are darker and chaotic\n\nSo there's a reason why the focus has been kind of change\nThe focus is on the consciousness the focus is on the duality of consciousness the good and bad trying to find some sort of scientific investigation or scientific method or scientific\nHypothesis is going to tell you what good and evil is how it affected as a disease rather than the facts and something that would be spiritual and psychological or disease or something that is\nParasitic that crawls into the body and consumes the body little by little burning get or eating it piece by piece little by little until there was nothing left to put a husk nothing left with a hollowed out show of a human being because this is how dark it gets\nA new one\nNo one use even thinking about it right now you know why because we have the manipulations politics that are taking over right now all people didn't care about is the blue wave with a red wave but the way it did they tell you there's a way of coming it's not blue it's not read it's black\nA black waves coming the dark wave is coming\nLike a storm it's moving like a cancer and we\nThose who need to be aware of those were the storm crows

parallel worlds shines new light on the paranormal in fact it should\nBe a book read by all people who wish to find out what is new and what is I guess not necessarily scientific which what science is doing now and how they're looking at the ... how we're looking at it with a different view\nRather than the tainted view of the new age we're looking at now I'm more practical less dogmatic view of the paranormal and of course Paul you know is one of the men who are you know have been one of the pioneers of investigation of course he ah\nHe's been involved with several investigations has a how long have you been how long have you been interested in working a on paranormal projects and and been been involved with paranormal the paranormal so well it's\nProjects in and been been involved with paranormal the paranormal itself\nWell it's it's coming up on fifty years is Clyde uh twenty twenty it'll be fifty years time flies and having fun I should I should have like a district one thing the book is it out yet it is going to be another year oh okay well yeah but it lets people storm last year for books in demand that they bring it out sooner but they might\nJust do it after the night I mean they're getting a new view people are just eager to get new views on this stuff and I'm eager to because I'd rather I'd rather get ahead of the game and knowing what we're learning now in in usually people are saying not science like you said there's orthodox science and the snicker factor but I think the sticker factors going away what do you think\nWell it ... one of the problems in the sciences at this not monolithic you know I mean there there are people who\nAre in one field you don't talk to other people that are ... for example um one of our our producers is a she works part time for us and she's a behavioral scientists old old friend of mine a way back in the seventies and her husband is a is it now and I'm a behavioral scientist as well and\nI find that many people in that science particularly people on the university level you know we're teaching\nAcademics or don't know a lot about quantum mechanics you know a one of the problems of western sciences it again it's it's I ... the sciences or isolated from one to one another and reality is not like that are putting overlaps I've been interact and we find that in the paranormal\nUh on steroids really so to speak or so I think that that that is a problem or the isolation of one science from another but but that again maybe changing I think things are generally moving in the right direction as we discussed at your earlier\nYeah and and then we we come to the conclusion as we're discussing things are about for example a the idea of possession and it seems to be a very hot topic right now\nUh the the Catholic Church of course is uh discussing actresses a more a lot of people turn witchcraft a lot of people are turning to ritual is the cursing or were chauvinistic\nUh I don't know what they call it to bring him to pass in conjuring okay these are the things that are now or the younger generations are turning to Generation Z is turning to this I'm calling a generation X.\nFor lack of a better term um and and the question is is there a a Bible tore or some sort of a power that can I guess it's like really ... bring about a a lot of things that are that we see as miracles or otherwise paranormal thing\nWell I think before they even get to that climate to consider a couple of sociological factors okay ah the deaths of Oregon at the desk but but but the decline of organized religion\nOr partially through its own fault shooting itself in the foot with you know with with the horrors like a clergy sex abuse you know I'm really glad I wasn't or Dame of the Roman Catholic Church amen would have run into all that uh so there's that and and I often I always question everything even motives\nNow in the Roman Catholic Church which I'm not been associated with for forty years I still keep in touch a the Vatican a is a strange place I had friends there who were priests who were wonderful worked in the secret archives which really is such a thing\nAnd uh but you know like like they're going to tell me what's going on uh I get the impression however that the emphasis on it just as of today is uh mostly legitimate but there was a factor of distracting\nOf the public from the clergy sex scandals as well and they keep looking the other way so there are practicalities their sociologically we live in a society where not to be cynical but most people never get any older than twelve\nAnd they act like it or the parents a lot of times uh many parents don't do parenting any more children I taught self control um you know and and even get his basic is that for the reason why people are and you know are are looking and and acting as sort of\nA out of control on the other hand you have the decline of religion as I said which is leading to a a frustration among the human species which really ought to be called homo auto runs rather than homo sapiens and then we really don't know much but we do worship we're constructed divorce was built for\nWorship when the worst part of the programming process because it seems to me that it's we're looking into the possibility of living in sort of a matrix constructed by something\nThat we're all programmed to do certain things act certain ways and it's all part of the process that's why we have the situation with politics today and religion today it's all turning into one big mess one big division some sectarian divisions minute cuts that will be coming up\nOkay well I was a in a wide them whole summer doesn't sound like a Catholic similar but it was and the faculty there was surprisingly friendly to my paranormal involvement the the one of these ones before them we're not neither was my bishop [laughter]\nBut uh I was home for Thanksgiving vacation was November Nineteen Seventy four and Lorraine worn a tremendous called never turned down a meal cooked by Lorraine worn so I innocently got into my Nineteen sixty eight for failing and headed down a road eighty four to a model Connecticut where they lived and uh\nHeaded down a road eighty four to a Monroe, Connecticut where they lived\nAnd ah [noise] as soon as I got to their their lovely home in the woods uh Lorraine came leaping out the door and said are you in a high spiritual state right now\nActually I was in a terrible spiritual state because I was trying to decide\nWhether to leave the Roman Catholic Church and and join the the eastern ... church which I originally did but naturally I said oh yeah I'm great so awfully went down to Bridgeport a little house people were surprised by the size of the place very small [noise] ah where all these are this activity was in full swing\nNow what had happened wasn't there as there always is with these things um I Believe again these are parasitic all energies we were thinking that were demons and the person will get cynical entries will feed upon your fear your anger or even your annoyance\nAnd it starts out always very small in this case of started that was pounding on the walls of the previous year out of the background here this is a child or they were they weren't child was the ... the the son had died and they adopted a a Native American girl from Ontario, Canada or who was named Marsha ... she was ten years old when I came into the case\nAnd they were all kinds of factors there having to do with her being kept in the house and the energy building up and all of a sort of thing so it into a house and uh the place was a complete disaster or something had taken\nA a doll carriage owned by the little girl ... taking things out of drawers and off shelves and put them into the Dow carriage and we'll get around\nThat the first thing I actually saw a ... there were there was a police presence already the people that they didn't know what to do an off duty officer lived across the street was a friend of the good and family that this is their name called them his on duty comrades and that's how the police first got involved [noise]\nAh there were also city engineers would come earlier before everything kind of broke and are trying to decide what the pounding was whether a size making all this business\nSo they were the house was full of cops and when I got there and it wasn't just I went down with that more and Lorraine ah went down with father bill Charbonnier who was a Roman Catholic priest\nWho was a that they were hoping to have him perform in ... in the house now in the room and shirts that is very uh institutionalized in their strict rules about it and you have to get permission from the local bishop in this case the bishop of Bridgeport\nThat never came over the better part of three days we were in this house\nThe first thing that I actually saw\nWas a a word\nWas a huge chest of drawers and the little girl's room and nobody was in the room at the time fly across the room and smash against the wall thing the thing we had to be several hundred pounds anyway\nA one point that they also I stood there with a three police police officers on one side three firefighters on the other and the ... the southerners watched a refrigerator about three hundred pounds of it float up off the kitchen floor\nKind of turned around and lo and kind of set itself back down or one of the police officers backed out of the house backed down the sidewalk sat in his cruiser and wouldn't come out\nAnd the wedded blaming uh again we thought these were demons but I was getting the impression from from the first minute I was in that house that there were four entities\nAnd they didn't seem evil and they were coming and going okay\nAnd interestingly enough or another thing I was getting the impression was that when objects would move and you know there were tables and flip over things of this kind objects will be torn off the wall at one point I stood in back of the little girl when she was my job was and weren't told me to watch the little girl to make sure she wasn't doing any of this\nAnd um she was sitting at the table the the cheer floated up I grabbed it pushed it back down and it just that was one of the few times I felt that there was an entity president ordinarily um one thing should move I didn't feel any empathy for us\nAnd I think it perhaps it's because of of the [noise] the energies ... if you want to call the multi ... into world energies the permit the entrance of these things\nAre who

on was speculating why we have left the house right so everybody had come down at that point but I'm the only thing sort of degenerated into chaos because the the following day\nThe or the police are we left simply as we David symptom and eat and get some rest\nAnd the police came and as soon as we left in and said this is the end of this the cities and chaos the kid did it so the whole thing was

across the country working out the kinks of a love the idea in real time ... storing praise and intense criticism Jillian what's happening\nOver the past you know ten or so years\nLocal communities states and others across the country have been experimenting with providing students with tuition free college and the idea of kind of got a boost with the presidential elections that we saw Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton talk a lot about different ways that they could potentially may call it ... college free\nArts so give an example or to a pool is trying to watch\n[noise] yeah so states like Tennessee are you know arguing programs where they make community college free to you know to students in their states [laughter]\nUm and the idea behind it was kind of state level programs as you know it's a little bit more about workforce development so in Tennessee they were like we need to attract more companies here to attract more companies here we need college educated workers how are we going to get them we're going to make college easier\nTo pay for it and then when you know local communities that have these programs so the most famous example is in Kalamazoo, Michigan where a group of anonymous donors I said and two thousand five\nYou know everybody who graduates basically from public eye on outlets sale or going to pay for them to go to college in Michigan [noise]\nUm and the idea behind those programs that if you give the community free college kind of as an incentive than other organizations that to make it to that students can take advantage of it to the public

couple of these programs are maybe most of them it does seem like the organizers are having to hit up a lot of donors are kind of getting some of the bigger companies around the area to chip in\n[noise] yeah so that you know that's kind of one of the reasons why advocates of these things like\nThe idea of the federal government doing it and because then they can [noise] you know ... the funding is a little less precarious but yeah especially on a lot of community college systems are starting to offer these programs and at that level you know community colleges don't have that sort of the huge fundraising arms\nOf other colleges so it's really you know they're really like\nTapping donors repeatedly and you know they're trying to get corporations that kind of be sustaining donors for these programs that it can be hard and if you made a promise students that you're going to do that you started off at the live on it\nOr yeah it's just ... funny I mean is that the phrase you're going forward in terms of most tabs for these programs to continue and thrive\nYeah so that's really important in Tennessee they did an interesting thing where they um tip the lottery finds and

the Dallas Cowboys his new addition a mark Cooper visit with the media yesterday all that more coming up in sports okay well what times the game on a Saturday during a sex [noise] six o'clock pm K.\nSo um there's a lot of people voting yeah yeah I heard that people ... students don't get up early you know\nAnd that's why they're still in line at the end of the five o'clock and uh so you know you gotta let them vote that hey there there that's right\nThat's the thing and uh now but I understand there are a lot of people who get paid a lot of money to figure out where they're supposed to put their advertising you know these these lyrical consultants do\nGet this ... they really they get about two weeks worth of ongoing information and you can bet at the end of the day\nThere's some people out there who know exactly who voted and more importantly who hasn't voted and then they go after those people who haven't voted to kind of entice them\nTo get on the bandwagon and go vote the folks that haven't taken a selfie with the guy voted sticker yeah that's ... exactly now the deal is the probably the first day help the Democrats um which is interesting because\nThere would seem to be a lot of new voters would voted for the first time so that would tend to indicate that those would be\nProbably Democrats al yeah now old folks got nothing else to do so they shoveled out into the ... first day too so but but it would appear that or at least a as they do a little analysis of the the first day of voting or they found is thirty six percent\nOf voted in the Republican primary thirty four percent\nIn er about thirty three point eight percent in Democrat primary but six percent voted for the first time ever so really yeah so that that may tweak the numbers and then but there's also stuff that will happen like this march coming up that that may change you know those folks are coming up from the south\nThat may in fact change what's important in the election don't don't know for sure but you know the fact that that the president was hear clearly that's supposed to help some and of course as you mentioned they do better whatever his name isn't isn't everywhere you know all you have to do is click on almost any website you'll see that\nCNN came out with an article that he spent more money on Facebook ads in any other candidate oh wow\nWell thirty eight million bucks is a lot of money that's going to pay a lot of money to ... uh I had a uh the other thing that's interesting I I talked to a\nCongressman floors and he said he has more college students in his congressional district in any congressmen in the United states\nReally yeah yeah 'cause he's got what Waco right as we got\nHere and he's got ... and he's got it I mean so he's got he's got a lot of college students and so you know that's interesting and uh anyhow but the the uh the watchers have an opportunity to do a whole lot of analysis on this early voting so it's important to the but the other thing to remind people the is\nJust because you if you want to vote straight ticket that means you're not voting for school board right now that voting towns council and the propositions that they have in College Station so you do have to go all the way\nDown the ... I've never I've never voted straight ticket I mean well you automatically get on there and we have the discussion about prop one and and the for College Station or Canada or the five ... candidates\nAre who are running for the two musicians or city council discussing prop one one thing that I think is misunderstood is they believe that this saves money for them to have their elections this way right if you move it it really doesn't change the amount of money that's spent\nBecause the school board races going to happen anyway and that's paid for by the school district and who pays taxes in school district ... the people who live here okay so you're not saving any money necessarily if you split those to up\nThe idea is you do want to get as many people engaged as possible right at that but it all has to do with that's the reason\nThey don't line up because it's currently a three year a three year term for mayor and city council and what they're saying by making it for than it would line up so that you would always have those elections are aligned with ... with other races that are going to be on the ballot\nDoesn't that kind of contradict the whole though yes her now than it does yeah there were no lawyer because in mid term generally don't have this kind of that and I know it's kind of rare it's not normal for it to be like that\nSo do you guys know Hudale Hansen is no sure he used to do sports on W. F. A. A. and he has his little I don't know what you call those soap box right segment or whatever he gets up and basically tells everybody how terrible they are but\nAh I guess a couple of days ago he got up there and said that he voted for the first time in forty six years wow\nBecause he had never voted after Nineteen Seventy two All right and said that uh after he had voted for George McGovern that he figured that he was too dumb to to go out and vote anymore and uh that's added that he should vote because America deserves\nBetter ah okay there you go I don't know what that means but I I don't either ... Dale Harris is an interesting guy he\nStarted doing these commentaries because he lives in ... okay All right and he would commute and so he would go and sit the coffee shop and talk to these old guys and walks a hatchery and he that way he kind of knew what America was knock it or what this part of Texas was talking about so that's how he built a commentary on the other thing was\nThe reason he went into sports reading the news is because he didn't have a college degree and at that time you had to have a degree in journalism to go to work at a Dallas television station in news and he didn't have that so he said well what\nThe heck I'll just do sports so they all have I mean why the heck not sure but yeah and he also said that we should do away with electoral college you know I don't really know how much\nAnyhow he's done a lot of different uh he he has a lot of commentaries out there I guess they may be you know on a podcast or they maybe he was on our someplace is that right yeah I Am and brought him on when I Know well I think the whole idea is now that he's not\nTV I mean it's he'd becoming one of the last of the commentators there aren't a whole lot of just people who come out and do commentaries he writes very well but uh he he is a is an interesting guy ah let me say I think we'll be talking to the congressman today and then also the mayor with exciting news\nAnd the congressman today and then also the mayor with the exciting news oh everything's deciding news will be talking to him actually from downtown Brian okay they because they got a big win thing going on there I had six forty eight right\nNow I ... valley and be on when it's time for a new sewing machine or a vacuum we'd love for you to shop for a locally owned shops so back city we've been located in College Station for over Thirty years now so back city offers a full range of sewing machines for beginners up the experts we all for free and structural issues with your purchased to make sure you get the most out of your machine\nNeed to have your machine repaired we work on all sewing machines from old genetic so back city come on down to see us for check us out online at W.

thoughts on this group of people who are working their way up to the United states from down through Central America here's what\nI Would do if I were the president I Would have a ... test to go ... with Mexico and ask 'em the Mexican government if we could set up a U.S military um I'm basis if you will on the southern side of the border\nAnd basically set up a um a sanctuary areas there are these people can come in and be processed we can figure out who's trying to apply for asylum process so separately and then turn everybody else and send them back the problem that we have because of the current laws broken\nIs once they put their foot on the U.S on the border they've got to be processed through another system that doesn't have the resources are infrastructure to do it and they base it turns into catch and release\nA when I met with the president on Monday a budget a Brady and and um [noise]\nUh Louie Gohmert and a ... a John corner and our meeting with the president along with John Cornyn Ted Cruz I mentioned\nYou know my idea would be to ah you know let them come in and get 'em all cleaned or give them some sandwiches put them on buses drop half of them often Maxine Waters district mainly hills and the other half in downtown San Francisco\nMan being facetious I Know I don't want our ... our audience to get started up right but uh it got all after that and said yeah that's an idea and uh but you know I I what I Would do is I Would I Would have Mike Pompeo work\nWith the foreign ministry a secretary and um and in Mexico and try to set up joint operations on some of them were\nThe number apprehended is is a little alarming last September is thirty one thousand this September it was fifty thousand that were apprehended yeah uh what does that say well what it says is that\nThe laws broken and because when when the president first got elected the numbers plummeted because they knew what he meant what he said and then they ultimately figured out that his hands are tied behind his back because uh once they come in\nThey've got to go through this processing a regime\nThat does that basically as catch and release and because they're just not a system unable to do if our law had been changed to say hey we have more uh security that's robust and are you know he goes up the wall\nAnd then be if you're caught on our son where we just turn me 'round no processing no nothing you turned around sent home even if you're applying for asylum because there's an asylum process where you go to the local us gals slip back home or you come to report a victory\nIt'd be violate that will say no Saddam absolutely not ever in turn you turn around and that would change behavior of people coming up because they know they're not going to be successful\nAre the problem is is we had two bills while of or the house in June or July we voted on that I voted for both of those and we had no Democrats support and we had a rump group or Republicans voted against them as well\nOkay you use the term he calls it a wall and into president so in essence what you're saying is a virtual wall rather than a physical wall abortion care system is what we have I mean in the way the but is that what excuse me but is that the way it ends because it sounds to me like Trump wants the physical wall\nWell he talked he calls it a wall because that it's easier terminology for him to use and it's also what our base wants to hear but what he is talking about and he said this should be actually drilling is interviews with him\nHe wants to border security system that has barriers were appropriate uh that also has troop boots on the ground or that has a all the technology of systems that we can put in place ...\nAnd uh that has all the technologies systems that we can put in place aerial surveillance ground sensors cameras um you name it and also a road where we can get one part of the border to another part easy right now it takes more secure border patrol\nHours sometimes to go you know sixty miles and so that's what he wants kind of like what Israel has in their in their barriers that they have around riskier areas\nCovers and bill for joining us this morning I'm quite a few people voted the first day of early voting what does that say to you I think that there's a\nReal intensity to in this election to vote and it's

went in every booth was full\nOr had a small weight and they said they had five hundred and thirty some people vote on Monday and then yesterday they had just over five hundred through about three

probably\nI don't really want sometimes use three times or show we use the ... effect I went that button and I want to rent grow and I would not over\nYou know you don't get Louis an ugly forget it I was actually going to see what you're doing bug but if we get a new 'cause you run you over asked um ... ... ... you must know in a written will not allow them to be about ... button or would I be allowed to decide if you've ever used it was ...\nFrom the button and now you would not be allowed to do now going to punish you button no no absolutely not there will be no no button punishment know there'd be no punishment well we were\nLosing clear mind when ... man on you\nKnow it's a editing nine four one ... one more quick one make friends from Paul in New Jersey come up\nHigh yeah real quick why all these big shot media people they rip Trump morning through the night you know and they want him to apologize\nFor things he might have said or say or for somebody and his rally but meanwhile their highest paid people in the country and they rip the guy all day all night long twenty four seven not even before it became then\nAnd now they claim everything and remember that and just remember the thing at West point where there was somebody wrote some racial slurs somebody's door right or like you never heard anything about that ever again\nAnd the reason was because it was a minority or somebody black who actually wrote the nasty letter and you never heard anything so he comes to be the same exact thing you're ready apologize he already get so I think it's terrible but no one in the media or on the Democratic side\nHas any guts to say yes we're instead they start saying Trump's gotta he should apologize\nWell I I think I think it's because the ratings go up so much appreciate the phone call the ratings go up so much because they've got their factions of the legions of viewers and\nListeners with the big cities may think that means the entire party your country agrees with them of course we do is eighty nine for one pack Joe ... muti when we come back to the Joe Petro sitting right here this is the Jim ...\nWhen you walk into that ... did you know you really get you know some some left hooks for now and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these horror stories and I'm trying to sell a book they figure that could kill me with the base but that's fine people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president uh hey listen I got fired Fifteen months ago I was it loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now uh I wrote a very cold or very funny book\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he was behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were like young father's deceased but I'm writing about it\nThere when they were like young fathers obviously now deceased but I'm going back into the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring in what they were life so this is a real fun book to write a rocket called me yesterday or she said that she she went through the book she read it a hundred percent but Bush said\nIt was great each couldn't wait to show it to her father Kurt\n... one of his best friend said the same thing you know ... and I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing nasty bad I'm a New Yorker I to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... short for pat and we will so why are we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like everybody I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president these people are fighters\nWho come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions pregnant president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional feeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you\nAre and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they're offended by right\nThere is a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place and like a Stradivarius now you're going to do is a ... and that's how people from queens or from my area or your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm sure that's my personality\nI agree with him and he's going to move to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now go and get this great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he said he's running for president were you a surprise I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty bad guys were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me says she's you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened\nI said it was a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies and you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media you know that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looked for a cost to now and tries to tell your fake news oh I don't understand it an editor and Acosta eats it up he does it every time\nYou make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media began to give him a job for eleven days but again I thought that it was really really good pick up the time I understand what happened but um when you were in that job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you did you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what a ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras\nBack on that first day Joe we announced era as a press secretary I did the first press conference\nAnd I'm so sorry that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team and also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net my calms plan but listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter\nI was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context to eat was being very a seat ricin flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah\nTrail me around and I'm like well I'm not Steve Bannon and I'm not their self promoting myself run I use them expletives which I obviously regret she loved that got it shaped ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\n... you know exaggerated article and then he really ... you know four or five days later people and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens into each other right why would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want an ambush in to see if we can get him out\nOf the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping to president so what's\nYour thoughts on it looked if you went back and bite but if you went and checked out the pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good topic because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't the only point you're just going to be very direct\nYou're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with the ministry Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered into a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happen to me but you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that\nGuys like you wouldn't you want to do we want to trust people\nHe ate Joe I made a mistake it's dishes by Bruce place down there I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something do worse for Wall Street is literally the best person down there so while\nI Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me\nUh a lot of my book is also about that well that you know where I got up dusted myself off I was sort of like mayhem on the all stay commercial coming through the car crash right\nAnd I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because we never want to do is be on your back for too long to if you don't want that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it you know is it writing it was really enjoyable for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a ... a bit in the book is the blue collar president Rodrigo Duterte go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the same color president a last question and I think people are dying to know the sooner but what's the relationship now with the president\nYou know I Would say is good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... surprised the United states I\nDon't feel the need to bother him a I had a very good conversation with them last July recording trade I put in an op ed in the S T the rigors intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similar late I'm and I'm not sure damn I Hope he's not a sort of me for what happened\nHe seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the good guys like ... I see myself a day was environment Korea was fired I was fire I call this S P else\nWere fired but loyal [laughter] so you know I I feel very good about the president oh he's got the one of the toughest jobs in the world I certainly didn't want to make it harder for them I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to help do I do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign a and I'm writing a lot of op eds form state by state\nEverybody can get this book the blue collar president it's Anthony Scaramucci you know somebody that you said earlier in the interview really stuck out\nAnd it's a you know here just Fifteen months later and you're still loyal to the president ... was out for Fifteen seconds and had a new book so I I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you could look at me look at my listeners and look at look at my viewers and say I made a mistake I should have thought the ...\nBetter and I really think I could have been ineffective guy I agree with everything that you just said I think that's also got on the mistakes you\nMake in life you're going to tell my kids that'd be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one last thing which I think you would appreciate grown up the way you did and as soon as they do know whining and sports of politics Joe\n... facts are going to win in five on a story to tell you like the machine\nWell I'm a I'm a big Yankee fan obviously but but if it's going to be the ...\nLet me see well I I'm a big Yankee fan obviously but but if it's gonna be the ... anybody should be the red Sox 'cause they'd be the allergies\nI'm just like you know to a machine that they were like last night so to me no ... or ... days I got slammed around uh but I'm having a great in\nLife I'm very glad to be able to put my life back together with my white uh and like I said like I said to him on a yesterday everything's good I think your dad made me as famous as you malign yet and then sleep with them or peace daughters on you know I thought it was great I mean it's funny you said that no\nThat that's also mold listed Anthony we appreciate you taking the time hopefully we can talk again very soon my main go and get this book the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci thinks a million my front I appreciate you all that bad enough to do this and the Joe packed jokes that writer\n[noise] you're listening ...
