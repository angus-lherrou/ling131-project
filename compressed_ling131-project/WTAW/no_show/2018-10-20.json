supports Colin Kaepernick\n... did I get that right\nThat's yeah that's what I read I mean whenever\nAnd by the way your microphones fine as repressive you're like this during the braces very loud so don't worry don't build back here um\nFor me a couple of things I think ... is a good singer I think she's a beautiful woman\nClearly I'm not as educated on this topic is maybe like her to be but why would you throw away and opportunity like that because of a guy who of his own volition is out of the league but\nBoy when I say in your room or into the NFL now than I Am I used to be a great expert or the ... and when you know not for three years and I will go back and watch unless they all stay in for the national anthem in the NFL starts flying in essence\nYou're fine but you don't stand there and do that I'm not going to support them but let me make sure that I have the ... story right he was the starting quarter quarterback for San Francisco\nTook him to the super bowl the last of the ravens\nSeveral years ago double threat running in passing the quintessential athlete and it looked like more NFL quarterbacks would be like him\nBecause of how successful he was then the defense of started figuring them out and it wasn't as effective anymore and instead of getting better he was getting worse and then he ended up being the second string quarterback was behind Alex Smith\n[noise] ah no I think by that time they'd already trained them away okay and then they had but anyway yeah backup ... than it was yeah right\nAll right so um he's he's ride the bench and out of the blue you start sitting down for the national anthem once the cameras realized that he started kneeling for the national even been some other guy would deal with them than other players were league which started kneeling and when he was asked about it he was wearing like Fidel Castro shirt\nAnd a sure was Malcolm X. on it or something and he's talking about oppression and he's talking about I mean honestly to me the whole thing is weird man\nBecause he was a guy who had a contract where he was making eleven or twelve million dollars a year now there was this is not widely reported there was a nother year on his contract\nIt was a player option you that would have given them nine to eleven million dollars even though he was just a backup\nHe walked away from that in San Francisco one would assume because he thought that there would be a long term contract and even more money waiting for males wear well guess what crickets happened and he didn't get another offer and then you started hearing that the ravens wanted to talk to him that he started hearing the the Denver Broncos wanted to talk to him and he was complaining the entire time that he's not been blacklisted from the NFL because he's dealing\nWhich didn't happen\nIn fact John Elway said we offered him the opportunity to be here and he said no you didn't want to be here so he could be in the NFL Maria Anna is not doing the super bowl halftime show because you showing support for him and I guess she thinks that he's been black Boulder blacklisted from the NFL because of his feeling is that why she's doing it\nIt's got to be why right probably but I also think that it has lots new in um her connections to the\nVoters have to do with it in a couple of years ago ... to the halftime show she's married to him\nRight but that was me for the whole ... thing happened and then now since then are you sure yeah other capital where he was dealing now or the ... and that the new environment the bar\nAnd you might have been nearly but he was so what you're saying he was still in the league right now the league\nRight I\nI don't get it honestly don't get it\nThey got this story is told his true right he turned down an opportunity to be on the Denver Broncos he walked away from his last year was contract I'm not making it up and I\nKnow well then what does she complaining about it was his own dumb decision that that led into this\nAnd he still claiming that he's still working out and and I guess Randy if he wanted him but I don't\nGet that he should try it again in Denver offer that nobody has has given me any good information to say the gentle way was lying so it'd be maybe you take the offer that's on that's on the table\nAnd here's somebody who's really I'll take calls and ... if you can't get through just go to Joe talk show on Twitter as I said I Lived tweet here's this guy Dusten was going to say his name but he has called in\nA in Kansas City who wrote to be on my Facebook page and there was a store cute little child when I didn't respond and fast enough I guess you didn't realize that it was actually working at the time and I couldn't respond to his crazy negative review of me or so he's on the line now and look\nI I'll I'll give them credit for actually having a set big enough to call the program Dr let's go man let's mix it up what are you got\nIt is there a you invited me and so here I Am\nI did I invited you because you were ... stupid on my Facebook page alleging that I I was taking too long to answer your your bad review I'm working why when I started out why would I used to always stop working to answer your dumb review why would I Do that\nWhen you stop to work in a long enough to call me clueless\nAnd tell your clue is right it took me last time I took me two seconds to write clueless but now that you're on the air filled me and what what is it that I have wrong let's go\nWhat you have you told me that I'm an idiot not clear listen I should call the show and you tell me why\nNo no no I didn't tell you shine where I show me where I called you an idiot and and told you that I Would tell you why you wrote event you got it okay here here's a bit\nSo that style um stop what do you like stop stop\nThis isn't going to work you can't talk when I talk because nobody can hear you\nHere's the thing I I gave an overview to my listeners of what you wrote\nWhich was basically I lean Republican my whole life but it's horrible with the Republicans will be gone had become everybody that I Know is going to stop voting Republican and in fact I'm going to do all I can devote Democrat and there's a I'm going to vote Democrat in this coming election now tell me how someone that's exactly what you said tell me it really\nIsn't going to put you on hold here here's a way it's going to work Dusten this was a nationally syndicated radio show your heard by about five or six million people right now and so far you sound a little bit\nUneducated even ... you you wrote yourself\nBecause of how far the Republican Party went away from what you believe in you decided you could never vote Republican again in factory me do you tend to vote Democrat that's what you said\nI said you're clueless if you'd like to correct that I'm listening to you go ahead\nI guess right as I said I said it's because of the girls the Carter from traditional Republican values there\nSo what is it the Democratic ... what is it the immigrants are offering to you know what what is it the Democrats are offering to you that you would vote for them\n... ... how many what they're offering that you would give them your vote tell me I had in the ... and I knew that let's go okay\n[laughter] wow [laughter] like I said there and ... it's just a partner from\nFrom from the traditional one of the Democrats going that they'll get your vote\nFor ... that I was\nUh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas\nThat may be a Republican wouldn't 'cause the Democrat even though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't they find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really aligned with the radical left a which\nIs really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's ... he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government is also pro abortion me the guys are socialist he wants to\nMedicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me Ron in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some former lifters loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that they that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic I'm In Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics and in South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California\nUm and then of course in central Florida you know we've had a burgeoning population of people who are Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually endorsed by the sitting congresswoman from Puerto Rico\nOr he's a Republican and a friend of mine and so I think that\nThe reason why Florida we're doing good because we're producing economic opportunity\nAs Republicans I mean we have the lower ... unemployment in the history of our country and it's a and I think we can do even better in\nFlorida you're not going to do that though if you do what Gillum wants to do is raise taxes forty percent\nA single payer health care you know on and on and does\nThat would really be the end the Florida is economic momentum so I think a lot of these are\nReally across the border looking at it and say you know I Want to be able to have a good job I'm going to be able if I work hard to be able to get ahead well clearly if that's what you're looking to do and I'm your guy because I'm going to build upon that Florida has has had economically I Am not going to tear down\nWith can fifth get tore pots policy\nIt's run run as soon as he used a Republican running for governor of the great state of Florida former congressman from down there but let me talk specifically about school school safety you know there's a good friend of a republic\nWill course tragically lost his daughter meadow in Parkland, Florida and then there's the high school in February fourteenth that area of the state was put on the international map as ground zero of gun control versus you know armed guards at the schools\nUm you've got people on school boards like this guy Runcie who is a promise program Obama guy who will ignore the the violent criminal history of students just said that they don't have a a a record when they get out of school for some reason\nOr what can you do should you become the governor I Hope that you will become the governor rethink your gun but what can you do from that offers from that position\nTo stop allowing sheriff's like Israel to turn a blind eye to a bad guy who could walk on campus and kill a bunch of people to get people off school boards like run see who is going to ignore criminal records of people like this Eighteen Nineteen fifty three fifty eight I don't see his name I see his his prison number will can you do from that position and from that offers\nTo shore up our schools and guarantee your kids are gonna come up with the other day\nIf you had the way Florida works as if you have and if they're so like the Sierra who's elected county wide or the governor can remove them from office um and I said after Parkland\nAlso saying a share of as Neal though on on um blame other people in\nPower now for the cameras not be honest with the people a Broward County\nI said if I were the governor than I Would\nHave removed Israel I think that was appropriate thing to do what\nI'm In the ... I I'm a former navy by right when the when the ... and ground\nThe top one of the ship it's held accountable that's just the way it is all Israel was saying hey I gave the dad dad what am I supposed to do not my problem that's not leadership that passing the buck right and I thought it was disgraceful the way he handled himself so that is one tool you have but obviously I'm working with Andy\nPower as well to make sure that we do what we need to do legislatively\nI said at the school districts are able to protect their student they some school districts will do much better job and then I think Andy had a lot of problem uh getting the Broward school district right it's heavily bureaucratic a lot of very left wing ideas\nAre listening to read and he was trying to elect new school board members so that they could remove run the John and they they narrowly won so the you know that just I was disappointed to see that\nBecause I agree with you run sees policies helped facilitate what happened in Parkland\nIran would you leave them in a guy like really judge in Polk County to to show to be a guide to other counties he's doing great work there as far as school safety goes\nAbsolutely I ... we were in ... county couple of days ago grade he endorsed me with a bunch of the other share of me that that's a huge huge a plus for me in this raid almost a unified the court of law enforcement throughout the state of Florida partially because I've been very strong in support of them and have a\nGreat welcome to the ... usually hospital for the men and women in law enforcement and they realize that he's dead in her they're going to have a target on their boss we think he will damage dog the police and he will use law enforcement of the political football\nI agree with you it's a round as soon as this Republican running for governor of the great state of Florida is to Andrew Gillum let me just give you some quick hits in about a minute that we have remaining that I really appreciate your time run a taxation that looks like a tax cuts to point over on deck here if the house should go to the Democrats ... ...\nTax cuts to point over on deck here if the house should go to the Democrats that's not going to happen as the governor of state would you support the president and continuing to lower our taxes as forty ... people in the United states\nDamn right [laughter]\nSo that was that was pretty quick I'm All right a pro life obviously argue for defunding Planned Parenthood even on the state level\nSo yeah so that's a little bit\nOf what it comes to this caravan of illegal immigrants coming toward border what should we do we just keep on giving up because I Know the government wants to give a path to citizenship for anybody who can speak across the board or what do you do\nThat will go on he wants to abolish ice and they want and open borders or do I would say\nThe caravan should just be able to go in that foreigners get to determine who comes to our country not read the American people look I think the president or use whatever tools radically disposal I think the Caribbean needs to be turned back we've got to insist on the rule of law you can't have people just barking into the country\nI'm In the middle of the border and it just doesn't work and so I Know the ... monitoring up I think he will take some sort of back and uh and I think if we can turn the caravan around I think the debate and we've got about a mad at our southern border\nIf you were the governor he asked you to send National Guard from Florida there to protect our borders ...\nIt would depend on what that means we're like obviously we have a lot of them being not\nWith the hurricane right now that's a lot of this may not be the best time for it but if I\nHad a free our resources that that that some free time I think it is important because when the drugs come over the border you know that affects Floridians I mean the fence and all the Betty opioid a big problem in our state and I think that if we're able to turn that back that would be a good thing\nI Know that age would go with us for equalizing schools and education by by forcing more taxation and more public schools use against the school vouchers are you for or against vouchers\nOh we have we have a hundred and thirty thousand in\nMany of them low income on various scholarship program brains you want to end all of it\nRight or those I think that they're successful and they're in a variety of different ways whether it's low income whether special me whether we ever scholarship program for kids that are going to school for their parents and find a safe environment Andrew would cut the scholarship\nAnd force them back into the school where they're being bullied though he had very ideological about that even though these programs that work you would literally pull the rug out from underneath his family\nYou have ... scholarships like this obviously expert actually help lower income people why would be a gifted is not to be running I really appreciate your time now how does your the Republican running for governor the great state of uh of Florida it's wrong to see it as just do it again OK\nOkay thank you\nAppreciate you that's around to see it as if you're listening in Florida I Hope you'll seriously consider voting for the man he's going to be the right guy for the job in my opinion and hopefully in years as well your thoughts on that eight eight eight nine four one ... dot com keeping writer\n[noise]\nYes [noise]\nIn many bedrooms

I don't know what it is he thinks he does for San Antonio the people of San Antonio he does a lot for the illegal aliens that are here in our city and he seems to think that's a priority and it's not\nUm the priority should be for the people of the district you know that he that he represents unfortunately there hasn't been a solid conservative to take him on in that district\nAnd because of being recognition they'll keep on winning but he was on CNN I Believe this was yesterday and and if it was it was the day before but I'm actually gonna show the video on the live stream into and I played the audio here\nBut he's a I don't know who the host is and it's I'm not denigrating her\nI never ever ever never watch CNN I don't know who these people are um but he's being interviewed by her and it's about this guy to show geek vis a journalist who now the president says he's definitely did would otherwise dead who killed and we don't know what it was a hit\nOr he died I we don't know anything other than the speculation\nThat he was killed because he was an outspoken person or a Turkish journalists who are actually who was a Saudi journalist who was it at the Turkish um embassy I I don't know or the Saudi embassy in Turkey the whole thing ... to me\nI don't know all the details but along the shore of it is the allegation as he's dead\nAnd Joaquin Castro says about how this happened will make your face or will have the freedom we come back in an eight nine four one ... Joe ...\nMay have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies list to the crown prince to NBS in Saudi Arabia and that the president may have acted on that and one of the people that he took

Castro or for who young Castro or for anybody on the left is\nAnd what bothers me is there is a fraction of people in my maybe a sizable fraction on the left\nThat here's him say it and believes it that Jared Kushner gave a hit list to the crown prince that the crown prince then acted on that's what your representative some of you walking casual just said that and there are some of you to believe it\nOr but the long and short of it is that that needs to be investigated this entire the entire time line of what happened of any sharing of American intelligence with the Saudis and how they may\nBe dude I Want you to really consider what you just heard\nAll my ... misrepresenting when he just said no no no\nI mean each his own words I'm not putting one word and his mouth he just said something about Jared cushion or having a hit list giving it to the crown prince than the crown prince\nActing upon it\nAnd even I I Know that ... people other than getting a puppy somebody who's on CNN and looking at her I don't know her last name but this puppy person who clearly is on a network that leans very left so much so that walking Castro is not coward enough to stay away from there because he was afraid to go on my show we're going to I Want to deal in truth\nHe clearly felt safe going there and thought he could say I've seen reporting there's been reporting well that having been said and then he blows\nIt off as if what he just said wasn't as disgusting as it was this is the American left now I'm going to say it again\nIf you go and cash your belt and early voting starts

why\nJust like the city it'll roared ... you have to understand this is what they do\nI Will I'll bet poppy what's her face here probably got in trouble for saying oh is that we haven't seen that reporting I'm betting there might be some people may be the higher ups if she didn't want to say that you probably shouldn't say that look let that one goes with that summer for a bit\nThat is a U.S

heck someone is it could also pass on to their children people doing the no harm this is why it's so deeply an ethical ... have to wonder are these people doing it or not aware of the fact that this thing travels in families and secondly if they do\nKnow that it affects their children I think I mean and wicked that are hoping to court\nCommunist children I mean 'cause this is what is potentially what they're doing here they can actually\nCause horrible things to half of the communist children and grandchildren and yet those people are innocent that now that they're real that they understand magically noticed on the history of sorcery and ... and they know that that's what happens\nSo I'm I'm quite disturbed that there either so stupid or so vicious that they don't care that gone ahead and doing this\nWhat what troubles me is that as we see the symbolism being brought forward by the pope\nAnd we hear of women ganging together to cast a spell on cabinet this is the spell of harm the spell of binding\nAnd when we hear about this and then we hear a about a number of other women who have ah they're ah I guess anger and resentment to monitor Trump\nAnd when you hear that she was in a plane recently in the plane nearly crashed or that it was having mechanical trouble these are things that terrified me because I'm thinking that if these powers are are are being contradicted the thought forms are being created\nI mean we may be seeing some things will be put into play in the next few weeks we could really be damaging to the country's a hole and then we'd have a black magic can curses that are backfiring and our weaponized they could really harm a great number of people not just to comment on children\n\nWhat I'm Glad you said that Clyde because this is this is like taking what's happening tomorrow very seriously and I'll tell you why one of the reasons\nYou had so much immigration from Europe to America a hundred and fifty or two hundred years ago is because quite literally rural areas in many parts of Europe were destroyed by everyone accessing everyone else\nThat lets you to communities fell apart and the only way they could actually escape these access

complete social breakdown I wouldn't be surprised in the past has led the civil wars and things like this and it's\nYou know and then it's all happening at the same time that that we have the ...\nI think I have to commend your show Clyde because you guys have tapped into something ... something profound is going on right now at this moment and day at\n... like you said watch watch watch the bigger picture look at what's going on the world on strike to read the science because we really are living in a time of ethics inside this at the moment and where it's going to go I don't know but I I'm afraid\nThat some kind of a magical ed inconsistency coping with incompetence coupled with\nEd inconsistency\n... incompetence coupled with a lot of refreshed anger could lead to something very dangerous and we've got to watch and we'd psychic weather over the next few months as well as you guys have been doing it\nI was near showing up got unimpressive [laughter] for a while well we have and uh and then and then it because I have to dig\nDeeper than what we see on the surface to try and figure out who you know the first you you analyze the political then you add allies or what may be going on within the political and if you cannot make heads or tails out what's going on can't connect the dots\nOn a more I guess you'd call logical contemporary level you have to dig deeper into the rabbit hole and realized that maybe something is being conjured from the deepest darkest depths of the abyss and that they're trying to create these thought forums too confused and as we said\nLast night what little glitch in the matrix watch Big Love Chaffetz see how people react and how they react to trauma trauma is the best motivators fear is what will motivate people in the anger and anger

like call while you're out enjoying it can't be that\nIf you want more on ice on the lake just gone a cheap taco blue dot org and they'll tell you all about how you can get involved\nLots of other stories to talk about I promised you the idea of this crazy mess at the airport called boarding look we've all heard the admonition you know about getting to the airport early and and boarding a I get that part but listen to this\nIf you boarded a flight recently been you already know about the chaos and the gates right there can be as many as ten different boarding groups for anyone flying I mean the only thing they're missing is is like boarding group number eleven for people with personality disorders I mean it's crazy and if you don't know group urine and most people don't\nYou stand around confused or you're in the wrong line where you're booted out it only takes another thirty minutes to board the plane it's nuts\nNo one knows what group they belong in and sometimes it's not even about voting groups but lanes\nAnd United Airlines up until recently that five lanes for every flight departure by the way that in addition to the number of groups they had\nIt's ridiculous so now the airlines announced it now cutting Elaine's from five to ... to it about a thousand of its boarding gate around the world okay it's a start will work I'm not so sure because get this still has five separate boarding groups\nAnd confusion will still probably rain so here's my suggestion as a ... as it may sound forget the lanes\nJust have two groups do get mad at me here comes professionals and amateurs\nWorks for me it might even work for you are now speaking of airports we've all heard the admonition to get to the airport early right okay but how early everybody says two hours early but it's two hours enough\nSee it all depends on a how you're getting there and be what you're bringing with you or who you're bringing with you for example you're driving yourself when they get better at another thirty minutes to find parking and wait for the shuttle bus\nOr you're checking your bag we better at another three minutes and I'll tell you one many airlines have eight forty five minute cut off that means if your bags and checked in forty five minutes before the scheduled departure time\nIt ain't going\nDoesn't mean you're in line forty five minutes ahead of time your bag has to be checked in\nBefore that departure date forty five ... before that the parts of dropped forty five minutes in advance now by the way this also applies to boarding passes\nYou know it's a good idea I Do it myself you know you put up your boarding pass the night before on your own computer before you get to the airport and you think you're safe guess what no guarantee having a printed boarding pass ahead of time while it's a good idea it doesn't guarantee you anything\nUnless you physically checking for the flight the minute you get to the airport right you got that\nSo the two hour rule doesn't matter it's all compounded by how you're getting there what you're bringing in of course who you're bringing if you're a family of four\nHow you're getting there what you're bringing in of course who you're bringing if you're a family of four barrel out two and a half hours no matter how you're getting there because of just the confusion factor with baggage and kids and you know so I remember that and then plan accordingly now\nYou're going to love this story because well I just think you can't make it up here it comes\nLovers in the air what does that mean\nWell but you didn't notice you can actually legally get married on a commercial flight on a commercial flight you can\nFollow the rules are simple first of all you got to keep things regal\nMake sure you can legally get married or with the proper person on board some states allow anybody to marry you some states require a member of a religion or certified a person to do that so that you have to have the certificate Haitian down\nBut then make sure you have your enough fuels either on a commercial airline that's why we're in one country\nOr a particular state\nI'll tell you why in the second they listen to the early known advance and then things get fun for example in one recent delta flight a very happy couple from Virginia was literally allowed to walk down the aisle\nOn a south west flight the cruise serenaded the newly wed and guess who marry them the pilot no he never left the cockpit he did it over the PA system are now why is there are good reasons to get married over just one state 'cause that's what state you're legally going to be married and but even more important I'm Sorry I got I mentioned it don't get mad at me\nIf you ever get divorced you'll know ahead of time what state laws apply to you know seeing that you know\nAnd speaking of happily ever after\nA there's now a new world international report it's called the world's happiness report it was composed by an international group a psychologist and economists who ranked each country based on trust life expectancy social support income and let's not forget corruption alright here we go\nThe third happiest country in the world that would be Denmark\nIn second place Norway and the winner also in Scandinavia Finland that'd be\nA ... all these Scandinavian countries widow ... almost every year because they've got affordable health care and free education\nFor head of the good old USA do we only managed Eighteen even Canada where the head of us who is worst the most unhappy place Burundi in Africa but what's the takeaway here\nIt's not about being happy but if you want to be oh happy you're it could have happened in the number Eighteenth spot that draws you might want to head north to our Canadian neighbors are definitely hit the Scandinavia but there's the rub because once you get there remember they're happier\nYou won't be that happy because the dollar exchange rate in all those three Scandinavian countries will kill you\nBut anyway it's all about putting into perspective it's all about given things contacts that I I wanted to do that so we came in number Eighteen we're not ... but we got a little work to do and just remember they're the ones who are happy [laughter] we just need to be happier and speaking of happy\nIf you really want to learn about a destination when you visited a before just heading to a museum how about hitting so their library right think about this uh\nThere are so many great libraries around the world which gives you an opportunity to interact with the locals learn everything you possibly can about a destination but the people who actually live there but also note that or anybody else\nGive an example the royal Portuguese reading room in Brazil it's not only a great example of Brazilian architecture library also the biggest collection of the world the Portuguese literature outside of Portugal\nBut the people who were there knew everything about Brazil great conversations the trinity college library in Ireland is actually older than the United states it was founded and Fifteen Ninety two\nAnd hosts the Celtic book of tells that's the oldest book in the world that we know of\nIt's a great place to trace the entire history of Ireland\nAnd of course we all know the Irish are amazing story tellers you'll never get out of the library but you learn a lot about Arlen\nAnd in Austria which a lot of people call the capital of music you visit the milk monastery library it looks like a baroque style palace but what's cool about it is it's got the most amazing collection of musical manuscripts now the key word here is that\nYou're not going to the library libraries to read more study not at all\nThat's the that's the the camouflage area here what you're really doing is they're going to be the locals who probably know more about the destination than anyone else in the country and they can't wait to tell you about it\nBy the way this also applies to your local library in Atlanta in Virginia in Wyoming and California I mean they're under used\nThere are a wealth of information and everything short of go into the volunteer fire department which I always like to do anyway uh for the same reason who knows the place better than the people hang out and read about it in the library\nPlus just what they live there [noise] All right so do you want to get the usa happier on the on the happiness and next week more than I Do and if you want to be happy with that because when we come back\nA whole lot more [noise] from Lake Tahoe underground live out

than the guys who actually live here if you want more information\nOn a little late to go to our website Peter Greenberg dot com which will also give you\nThe global list for wherever you happen to travel joining me now like I say there's about every one of my guess she's not a native\nShe's not from here but she's been here sixteen years from Virginia I Believe a she's a publisher of her weekly magazine cover no how are you good how are you okay so I can ... call your local not even a sixty\nYeah I think like out what brought you here well I came for a job interview in the area I took one look at the lake and decided I was going to take this job no matter what they wanted me to\nDo basically underpaid yeah [laughter]\nYeah from the grocery store and they were getting ready to fight it\nBut you know when I hear about you know in any location that we go to you know there's a weekly magazine I go okay what are they going to put in there I mean how much news could there be but you do have news\nWe have lots of stuff going on you know it is I always say the balance place for endless opportunities if anything you want to do and Tahoe you can do it here\nAnd you've seen her last sixteen years change radically\nOh yes definitely there's a lot more to offered culturally outdoor recreation or events for people more opportunities to get out there and enjoy the like how do you enjoy like I'm a big hiker I also like to get on the lake and go out in the boat ... you know I also cross country ski and snow shoe but you name it you can do it\nHe All right so let's let's be real here when you were bored I'm assuming once or twice you have fallen in\nOh we've all fallen and chili is a bitch ... actually\nAre you working any kind of protective gear\nOr I usually do not but it's always a vital to have a life jacket but I think close to shore or to say if we do not advise people go out beyond the movies\nBecause the depth there is out of control and the depth it goes really deep very fast and people can get hypothermia shock so we invite people at their ... stance that the movies it's less traffic less way it's very safe there\nAnd for people who don't understand the lake and it's always a shock for people ... yeah I was like yesterday it was almost glass mhm today small crap warnings I mean it was as whip it up\nIt changes rapidly it's usually very windy and every afternoon but this time of year typically we do get very high when you'll see a lot of surfers on the lake\nSo we're talking to the fear was Catherine Hill who doesn't work very wet food although it well at that is in the summer [laughter] [noise]\nWhat was the biggest surprise for you when you first got here and what's the biggest surprise for you right now but\nI think the biggest surprise when I first moved here first experience Lake Tahoe is the beauty just the sheer beauty I was overcome by it and just do I had to make this part of my life\nCan I sound like a really bad brochure for sure\nUh we're over the phone number ... the phone number ... ... and I'm sure the light was just perfect I mean we didn't plan it that way but it was and you sit out there with the wind in your face\nAnd you can see unstructured for miles all the way across the lake with no high rises known the on so I Know nothing but greenery and hills and Scott ... and if that isn't the most productive thing I don't know what else is\nIt is that's exactly what it is you know you're just ... and living here you'd never get tired of it every single day it takes your breath away\nSo that was your first surprised when you first go yeah no what is\nThat the amazing community and talk to the locals that live here the locals that make this part of their life is just it's a great community not only and the fact that they love to preserve the lake and the mountains and the land that surround it but just in helping each\nPreserve the lake and the mountains and the land that surround it but just in helping each other and building community here and hosting events to bring other people to enjoy this beauty so that we can live here\nIn other cities or locations like this or you can't tell a similar story sometimes because the development of interest or or out of control of the the rush for for faster money invested revenue or is out of control the height of the buildings signage or\nWhat they do with waste water yeah all those things here that's different\nYeah it's very different here there's a lot of agencies or by state agencies Tahoe regional planning agency locals agencies\n... cooperation between the two state yeah that was that the leaders were unique about it and in California mhm\nAnd they just work together to preserve the beauty of ... ultimately all of our goals is to keep those major developments from spoiling the magnificent beauty that's here\nAnd we haven't mentioned restaurants ... I mean when I first came to a I'm not making this up when I first came into cheeseburgers maybe\n[laughter] yeah no I Would agree I'm Talking about Nineteen Seventy five I think\nSeventy six I mean fish was basically fraud mhm right we'd gone a long way\nYeah so how is amazing eateries now for every level every cuisine there's growing all the time it's become really a foodie area\nAnd yet it's still seasonal you have a lot of Russia's that were close at the end of this month and yet\nFewer than a fewer and fewer ... correct\nIt's just the ... you know less shoulder season which is then all of the locals working together to bring more visitors to come in October November and the spring months you know it's when it's beautiful and there's not as many people as they\nWere talking a chocolate heal the publisher of her weekly magazine so since you've been here for sixteen years like I figure I could ask you this question about your favorite places to go which is it's it's all are on food you know the\nBreakfast uh my personal favorite of Donnelly kitchen they've been around for a number of years and what are your order I order something called the hot flour tortilla which is a wave us ranchero without eggs and other places in Truckee replaces the turkey on Donner Lake\nOver in ...

I was wondering where are you a ... a firefighter or I Am a retired firefighter in Southern California and I've always wanted to live somewhere where I can be on a volunteer fire department well here's the good news got\nBefore the wherewithal drew firefighter remember this Seventy four percent of all firefighters in America or volunteer people don't realize that people don't realize you know started volunteer fire departments Benjamin Franklin Peters\nPeople don't realize you know started volunteer fire departments Benjamin Franklin Peters diverse in back in New York\nThe old bucket brigades a and outside of New York city or just give you an example an overwhelming number of fire departments are not paid to partners they're volunteer it's the butcher the bigger the candlestick maker and your true is that answer your question I'm a volunteer firefighter on the island the fire island in New York\nAnd for those who don't know it borrowed is thirty two miles long never gets more than a third of a mile wide Nineteen communities are far out and twelve of them minor among them has a fire department as you can imagine we're all mutual aid we help each other out\nAnd uh it's wild but so so necessary and it's not just fires it's a emergency medical situations in medical evacuations\nAnd in the case of serious dorms where the guys doing the mandatory evacuations as well or the other thing that's important is that anybody can be a volunteer firefighter you don't really have to be on the truck there are so many other things you can do to help out in every community needs you\nA volunteer firefighters have a recruiting issue they need more around the country and Scott wherever you are now a I'll guarantee you\nThere's a volunteer fire department that would benefit greatly from your expertise\nAnd you're and you're ... years of experience so I\nI Hope you get a chance to do that and and write me let me know when you volunteer ... will shouted out on the on the air up here's one from Joe Miller who writes\nWe're leaving New York city for Aspen, Colorado for two weeks the caller prices for the two weeks in Ashland are still irregular it makes it difficult to decide what is what help kayak is the least expensive but the pickup point a sketchy could be the Aspen airport or some other point\nCan you help me how do we get the best price than a guaranteed airport\nWell let me help you out first of all essence you know the airport asking is very close to downtown downtown such as it is in Aspen uh and chances are that is where you go to pick up the the car in bigger cities that's not always the case\nIn bigger cities or it may not be a good idea to rent a car at the airport because you're picking a premium for their expensive rent they have to pay the airport to have their lots out there\nAre the best way to do this as long as you want to do it on line\nThis is where price line can be very very effective because at the end of the day what do you want\nAn engine for tires and something that runs a minister and need to know if it's a vis hurts national enterprise whatever right you just want a reputable company that when you were part at a

eight eight to five six ten eighty let's talk gardening right now let's fill up this phone lines please eight eight eight to five six ten eighty\nAs we are as we\nHead into a the the second half of all of them one of the things that I Want to suggest to you is keep a close eye we've had a lot of rain across Texas this fall most parts of the state and that has brought on an onset of broadly weeds\nChances are you didn't get gallery put out the first week of September and so you may be seeing a lot of clover and dandy lines ox Alice\nPlanting and other broadly weeds and if you are some time in the next four weeks or so\nI Would be a good time to apply broadly to weed killer spray this is going to be a product containing too for the the numbers to and then a coma for an a hyphen and Diaz and dandy line to four D.\nOr their other activity ingredients in some of the product said try make is a is a blend of three\nA broadly weed killers I'm find either way but we try and make you have to be a lot more careful because it does have those other two products are active in the soil they can soak into the soil and be taken up through the root systems of trees and shrubs\nAnd then the third thing goes back to what I started with and that is when you water water deeply\nAnd then let it get a little bit dry before you water again you you don't want to\nWater a little bit every day that's usually when you get the shell roots right near the surface\nSomewhere in there I'll bet is is what you need to to help you but I'm not sure exactly which one of those is the biggest help\nOkay it is\nAlmost almost any well almost any nursery or hardware store or most feeds tourists will habit if you tell them I'm looking for a really good landscape fertilizer\nAnd you tell them you want to an all nitrogen fertilizer I I really don't want to get highly technical on it but there's an old type of fertilizer this very inexpensive and a lot of people think that's what I'm Talking about it is not that's ammonium sulfate is Twenty one zero zero and that is\nNot good for ... sets all fast release nitrogen\nThat would be like uh if I suddenly started to exist totally on soft drinks sugared soft drinks that with my only nutrition I wouldn't last very long and uh that's that's what that would amount to and giving to your lawn so what you want is a high quality fertilizer has a little bit of that kind of nitrogen\nBut also has a time to release slow release form of nitrogen and it to a good fertilizer a person a good salesperson I Will know what I'm Talking about and they'll know when you ask a what I Want a fertilizer that has a lot of slow release nitrogen\nAnd you know what they'll do they'll turn that bag over and they'll start pointing it at tiny print Hitler you'll you'll say oh my gosh Neal is sent me back to college back to high school to to learn about fertilizer analysis and you'll\nYou'll think of that tortured you or something [laughter] but but

your area\nUh and they can help you better than than I can without seeing it it's not going to be ground hogs um it it\nIt would be go further moles or something of that so that would be what I Would

marketplace if somebody finds a pretty color and a nice flower forum that it seems to me that they tend to\nUh introduced them into the market without testing for those common rose disease problems that sounds like battery mildew\nAnd uh I don't know whether they did if the plants have lost all their leaves and the stems or or brittle than yeah probably they are\nAre there are fungicides at will control powdery mildew but you have to spray pretty often you probably have to spray them a weekly even in alpine which seems kind of odd battery mildew is not necessarily totally related to the humidity a lot of people would think that it was but it isn't\nUm and and plus we're watering potted plants and getting him with it it would help to keep the water off the leaves and stems a hot water the soil but um but I'll bet that was black spot yet\nTo happen or out we had a gloomy place in a row right ah and then now and then that's when that stuff's show\nI watch your you're one of the book

I I read um deli they a lot of the kind that not all of them that they turned brown or yellow get black spots on that as\nBlack spot and and the the oddity about black spot is it starts out with yellow a leaves yellow ing and and yellow spots and then you see the dark\nIs that with yellow or leaves yellow ing and and yellow spots and then you see the dark brown they never really a big black spots on the leaves I don't know how\nWho came up with that what they call that or what has long\nAgo it's a disease it's a a fungal disease it is the number one cause of of rose problems worldwide\nUm my my good friend Dr ... George with Texas CNN uh planted several hundred varieties of roses about Twenty years ago I studied them for years I don't know if he's still doing that or not I wouldn't be surprised but uh anyway he was he was comparing them for their resistance to black spot\nAnd are the ones that were resistant in and did not develop black spot problems in\nFirst of all and the Dallas Fort Worth area and then later over the whole state of Texas and then later over the United states were listed as earth kind roses they could be grown\nA without without a regular spring like I was just describing for the battery mildew you might want to look at Texas A M earth kind roses and you'll find the ones that are most resistant to to black spot\nSteve's work kind of got interrupted or in the Dallas Fort Worth area by the horrible epidemic of a\nA fatal a virus called rose rose add that to a hit and and has taken things off course on roses and in the area where I live and work we we don't have many roses right now\nWho actually get rid of it or you get past the rain we're\nIn a way to get rid of it is to start with a resistant variety initially that isn't going to have to be sprayed otherwise if you if you have a variety that has some special meaning to you it has the it carries the name of\nYour favorite and then you just want to have a more of the you know the variety Martha because your ... name was Martha then you're going to have to spray it every week in the spring and fall\nAt ... you'll have like I say you'll have to get to a garden center and there will be several choices fungicides this this is such a huge\nUh uh issue that's one of the the big moneymakers for the ... or so or fungicides is something for black spots there lots of products on the market\nHere you into thinking well I go to the editor in about ... don't get the least rent gets why didn't they air that ride it out or any ...\nWell that's one of the problems if you're in an area\nWhere there is a great deal of rain and then you and I have to spray more often because it's a it's going to be more of a more of a problem I can only imagine how the rose garden in Portland, Oregon Kelly [laughter] right really have a challenge\nBut that that's black spotted you can do all the ...

and joining me this week is she as I as the chief academic officer Dr penny trembling a first off Dr trembling though you've been with the district for a short period of time a little over a year but what really drew you to the breath of spelling\nWell I had the opportunity to get to know Dr elite from some of the work that pass it does and as he talked about the district I saw a lot of opportunity and a lot of great things going on and wanted to be a part of that\nThere's a lot yeah I think it's a heard that from a lot of administrators that come here and I really want to be a part of the ... so I guess another question would be how's everything going so far and your first year that\nIt is great I Am enjoying being here it has been extremely busy we are kind of overhauling the curriculum and that has taken quite a bit of energy and time\nAs you talked about overhauling the in the curriculum I was going to ask for cheap academic officer obviously that falls under it so a lot of work as far as what you're going to be putting out there for teachers to teach in the classroom\nAbsolutely we are using an understanding by design methodology of planning and which essentially works for transfer for decisions in life\nWe have developed a learner profile the entire success team in our district did that together and everything that we do works toward building that profile ever graduate that we want learners to leave with those characteristics\nVery good will in an area like this I Know you're originally from the Dallas area but even in in Bryan College station you know you've got Texas a and M. right down the road you have blunt as well so I imagine that a lot of the curriculum is kind of geared towards a going on to college and either going to one of those two schools or maybe somewhere else\nCan't we weren't even joined a few more time now if you\nCan actually find out if you want to talk on the Gulf of\nGetting instance hopes that is now and max express

everything that you have done with your career and tell tell folks what you do right now it's part of your uh elected dude\nI'm currently a member of the people that check these serving at their secretary\nMy goodness and your former president President last year and vice president and you might as well\nThat's pretty impressive when it first of all I got taken gradually stepping out of the public light and doing something like that because I think you've asked last year by\nI lost my mind it but I Love it it did it the gifted serving the community as one of the\nTime you talk a little bit about this like at the stadium here because this is going to be something that a lot of people don't really understand it all Alan ... a lot of flak over that but I Will tell you in this day and time this was one of the crown jewels with this district and it goes beyond sports this is also about education\nIt is and right now currently the music the light the sound is out\nThey run by students um\nAnd and their mentor and then the career center which is our technical center here in Haiti I said by so it's a great learning and environment it's Seventy thousand\nKids hurricane so you've got not just the players that she's got that in student trainers\nAnd that ban and the color guard and the team and the cheerleaders and the lamb students that are running\nThe stadium itself so it's it's an amazing facility that just more than just the this is almost like a training ... ...\nTalk a little bit you're on the ground for we were talking about we have friends on the on most of the areas school board or around the breakfast valley area\nI talk to me a little bit about the challenges you're seeing with the state in particular where property taxes\nCommand you must raise it to this level school funding how often do you have to deal as a as a frontline board member I Would just say your problems in your issues that you face your or a little bit larger everything's commensurate in every school district\nThat is true and there's the rapid growth and Katie we actually haven't raised our tax rate with actually though an opinion that has ten years\nWe lowered it while I found the board um and that's just that\nAnd do it in any of the past ten years we lowered it while I've been on the board um and that's just simply the growth one thing people don't understand about Katie I asked the is it in three county [noise] three town and it's only sixty five percent complete good night and we are about a hundred kids away from having eighty thousand\nI knew it was huge I mean the closest in central Texas I guess that would be like the ... to the bus or the larger stuff we think throughout our market yeah it would be the biggest but but to have eighty thousand talk about how many campuses right now that you have over ... up and leading as part of the school\nWe're forty one elementary schools Nineteen his team junior high sorry and an\nEight

sort of all of a sudden you for your slots east side of the big boom without your that his legacy stadium so I can see where you're going with that\nI talk about a little bit about the quality control that comes with that I Would think that that's a\nBig issue for you guys have you must stay on top of your game because you have a president that you're setting as part of Haiti I it\nSeems to be a very desirable place [noise] yes we are we're referred to as a destination school district because we\nDo things at a certain level we don't compromise and a lot of things one thing is very important to across the district has equity could've built at an equitable network and so if if one campus get like I was saying\nEarlier when we're talking before this gets a computer lab and there's a couple of dinner that high that don't have it we make sure that it's something that's on our plans in every school every school has the same\nOpportunity to tame shop to think\nAbout the same forming art

we're going to please everyone but if you have to say hey here's my biggest eye opener what I actually got\nOn the board what would that be\nProbably the rapid growth in special education and um that is our number one ah largest growing population the hearing Katie icy\nI think a lot of that speak to the fact that we do it right we have a very well respected within the within the area and the state of special education\nI had a lot to learn I have three children and they none of them qualify for any needs a special education so that was something that I learned very quickly about 'em and it's ever changing and the things that qualify for her being special education\nBut also like you said the reasoning we call them attendance boundary modifications yeah I see a beat him in Asia and

money from some people and giving money to other people and the people who are getting the money don't really pay much fat in the first place\nJump to continue with with Harris attack when she's offering as much as three thousand dollars a year for a single person or six thousand dollars a year for a married couple on top of the existing tax and transfer program dispersed either as a lump sum tax refund or as a monthly payment\nAs many as eighty million Americans would benefit so who is going to pay for all of us the answer is that they don't care\nThat really is the answer they tend to this is going to jog the economy because if you give a bunch of money to people at the bottom end of the economic spectrum this is what creates economic growth that is not true and never been true what jobs economic growth is the creation of new products and services that create new jobs and it also allow people to buy cooler stop\nSocialism is about freezing the economy in place and redistributing all the pilots in the room ... capitalism is that expanding the size of the pie that doesn't mean that everybody is going to get an equal distribution of the pie but it does mean that you're going to be able to generate new and better types of pie bigger pie\nEverything that makes ... awesome ... otherwise you can just freeze it and distribute it until there is no pilot that basically the socialist model so where are they going to pay for all of us I Love how the Atlantic describes ... proposal of course\nThe federal proposals would come and she never getting caught in some cases on the scale of the Trump tax cuts or the Affordable CARE Act\nWas not the same thing from the tax cuts are not things that costs money their meat paying less money into the federal government that is not a federal cost\nA federal costs you spending my money not and you're telling me I get to keep my own money is not a cost to let someone keep their own money\nThe way that this measure doesn't say suggesting the Affordable CARE Act which is a government expenditure based on tax receipts is the same thing as cutting tax receipts by saying that people can keep throwing money is eight sleight of hand a fiscal sleight of hand\nThe brown legislation would cost one point four trillion dollars over a decade Harris legislation would come in at something like two hundred billion dollars per year which means two trillion dollars over the course of a decade\nHarris has proposed repealing the Trump tax cuts to pay for her bill that is not even come close to covering the kind of cautious talking about and they're talking about universal health care and they're talking about free child welfare and they are talking about ... or ... free childcare and they were talking about\nFree college tuition none of this stuff is going to get paid for so why why it has it their all this enthusiasm for this sort of stuff in a time when we have as an yesterday seven million unfilled jobs in the United states a four percent unemployment rate and historically booming economy why are we talking about undermining the pillars\nOf capitalism because we have shifted our mindset in the United states and this is really what I Want to talk about today we have shifted our mindset when it comes to what our wide should be like\nWe believe we are guaranteed things here in the United states we believe that we are guaranteed a solid level of living because we live here because Bernie Sanders all the time in the richest country in the world should we really have people who don't have enough money to buy all the things that they could possibly want\nTo hear that from Bernie Sanders all the time the assumption there being you were born here you deserve stuff\nYou were born here therefore America's rich therefore you get stuff it basically just dumps in your entitled to things\nHere is what you are entitled to in a free country you are entitled to adventure that is what you're entitled to your born entitled to exercise your rights in pursuit of adventure you get to make up your own story here that the American dream the American dream is people who are coming from across the the place they did not know\nTo an environment that we're not used to and building lives for their families and creating prosperity from the ground up\nThe American story is people crossing the Appalachian into wilderness they did not know places that had not been that going to areas where they had no allies setting down roads and trying to build towns and civilization that's the American story the American story is poor folks who have an idea\nAnd go find funding for that idea and then build that idea in some of the great companies in American history that the American the American dream was never you're here therefore we give you think that was never the American idea coming up the big problem\nWith this new vision of America as a place where you ... just guessing that it takes away to the American ideal to the ethics and the American personality that have been a central element of America has the greatest country on planet earth we'll talk about that in just a second to the bench the Russia\nAnd fly and then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of your way what can we do to remove the barriers that's the American way is not the American way it wasn't you know ... it's uncomfortable to stretch your wings it may be difficult to leave home it may be hard to do this\nBut it\nShows so we're just going to make sure you know you never have to we're going to Cato you we're going to make sure that your swab in the warm blanket of government benefits\nWe're going to ensure that you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy this is coming from a place of you can't innovate your children you can't innovate your communities and you can't intervene your country on the basis of empathy alone and that is the best case\nInterpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here the worst case interpretation is something much more cynical the purposeful innovation of an entire sector of the population specifically to gain votes and thereby political power\nAnd after you look at towns like Detroit it's hard to imagine that's not what's been going on there for decades because the failure of this sort of of thinking is evidence in major cities\nAnd counties across the United states\nIf he actually wants to reinvigorate the American spirit\nWe're going to have to teach people the same lesson the gods taught Abraham at the very beginning of the Bible I get up leaves a home that you were born in and go to a place you do not know that's how we become bigger\nThat's how we become better as hell wives become better to tell the world becomes better trade becomes better is why you have cool stuff is white culture has become better because they experience and bounce off of other cultures\nThat this notion that we can hunker down now because we've reached paradise and all we have to do it hunker down and live in and redistribute what's in our backpacks those backpacks are going to run out ... there's not any of this war okay Joe in just a second I Want to talk about this fascinating article in the New York times\nAbout why

product ship a regular price get yours today a dollar shave club dot com slash than a dollar shave club dot com slash then\nSo there's a fascinating article in the New York times I Want to talk about\nBecause it speaks to the lack of objectivity when it comes to the intersection with politics the article from New York Times is titled why white supremacists are chugging milk and wide geneticists are alarmed\nAnd here's what they say is from Amy Harmon nowhere on the agenda of the annual meeting of the American society of human genetics being held in San Diego this week is a topic like many of its members the recording appropriation of the field research in the name of white supremacy\nSticking your neck out on political issues is difficult\nTo Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the group's social issues committee who sought to convene a panel on the racist misuse of genetics and found little traction but the specter of the fields ... has passed which includes support for the American eugenics movement looms large for many geneticist in light of today's white identity politics\nThey also worry about how new tools that are allowing them to hone in on the genetic basis\nOf hot button traced like intelligence will be misconstrued just that racist ideology is an argument that I have a pretty frequent basis with a friend of mine Jane costs and over box\nOr Jane is black and and I think rightly has great sensitivity and everybody should have great sensitivity but I think Jane would suggest that her background contributes to the sense to me I'm with regard to the races past of\nUnited States and the and the racist association between politics and bad science and so this has led to some serious conversations between the two of us\nAbout political correctness about whether in fact there's an appropriate time to talk\nAbout IQ for example or standardized testing for example or about that natural differences between men and women\nLike one can you talk about biology without being condemned sexist or racist you know real issues that we have to discuss and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash a lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that science out of context and then use that to cooperate into submission minority group\nAnd that's basically what this New York times article about his in recent months\nSome scientists have spotted distortions of their own academic papers in far right Internet forums others have fielded confused where he's about claims of white superiority wrapped in the jargon of human genetics\nMisconceptions about how genes factor into American stock racial disparities\nHave surfaced in the nation's increasingly heated arguments over school achievement gaps\nImmigration and policing instead of long discounted proxies like school circumference and family pedigrees according to experts you track the far right today's proponents of racial hierarchy are making their case by misinterpreting research on the human genome itself\nIn a debate that have been largely limited to ivory tower forums the scientist whose job is to mind human the humanities genetic variation\nOr the collective good are grappling with how to respond if there's a real way to respond all of this put out the science and then defend the science that's the way to respond all of us instead scientists afraid that there are scientists are going to be misappropriated misinterpreted or used for bad reasons\nThey've decided that they are going to simply squash all of this discussion internally John November as University of Chicago evolutionary biologists he says studying human genetic diversity an easier in a society where diversity is clearly valued and celebrated right now that is very much\nOn my mind ones like Dr November his folded into his recent talks to pitch a group of white nationalist chugging milk\nAt a two thousand Seventeen gathering to draw attention to a genetic trait known to be more common than white people than others the ability to digest lactose adults it also shows and social media posts from an account and called entered the milk zone with the map lifted from a scientific journal article on the traits evolutionary history and most of the world the article\nLifted from a scientific journal article on the traits evolutionary history and most of the world the article explains the gene that allows for the digestion of lack of switches off after childhood or the arrival of the first cattle herders in Europe than five thousand years ago a chance mutation that left it turned on provided enough of an international led up to nearly all of those who survived eventually carried it\nAnd then the post shows it's a bit of hate speech urging individuals that African ancestry leave America saying if you can't drink milk you have to go back\nWell I mean so what they're idiots in one of the great ironies of of white supremacist there the stupidest people on the planet\nThey're constantly talking about how white people are superior and they're just dumb ass it it's one of the things that's so funny it's like if you're going to proclaim white superiority you really shouldn't send your best is I'm In a commentary that accompany the paper in the journal genetics documentary warned that research is wrapped in numerous cab yet that are likely get lost in translation because\nPeople are flaunting DNA ancestry tests indicating exclusively European heritage but the problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is a con founding factor when you look at attributing racism to America so take for example\nRacial disparities in education so there's a lot of talk these days about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels eligible to get them into college and the suggestion is that it is historic American racism that has led to that has led to the education gap in America's higher education system\nIn alternative would be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups and that is true not just with regard to black and white it's not worth production white and Asian white people score\nLower on the SAT that Asian people do as a general matter in the United states how much of that is genetic how much of that happens to be environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that's a hotly broad question in science but suggesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding factors like for example have scores\nIs a mistake and leads us to the wrong outcome and we just to the wrong measures to deal with those outcomes genetics is not the answer to all of these disparities but neither is racism now these are questions we have to be very careful that because obviously you don't want to give materials people course adjusting that people some people are near inherently\nAre inherently worse or more evil or more violence\nOr stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't wind up that way but\nYou also have to look at questions of science because he writes I it is so it it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time so that their doctors who have organized meetings and social scientist and it's a social implications\nOf the field newest tools David Nelson a Baylor College of medical geneticists with President of the human genetic society says it will not pay completely quiet on the issue is that there is no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology\nWhich is true because racism is a moral view and genetics is a scientific view and scientific racism is the use of science in order to be racist and it's not the use\nOf science in order to pursue good and so if you're silencing research because you're afraid of how people are going to use that research\nAnd I would suggest that are misusing science we need to have some very hard conversations about actual science actual problems in actual solutions without falling prey to the idea that because bad people are going to misuse the information we have to wash the information it's all okay\nComing up a bevy of actresses now say that Disney Princess is are very very bad we need to Disney Princess reject other Disney

K. A. K. U. dot org or my Facebook site and Michio Kaku we have over three million fans on Facebook and on Twitter we have over six hundred and fifty thousand fans on Twitter\nAnd Facebook you can see the for New York times best seller is that I read and the latest one is called the future of humanity talking about are possible future in outer space\nOr to be what would it be like to go back to the moon to go to Mars to go to titan and perhaps even to the stars but with us today to talk about going to the stars and specifically going to Mars\nIs Dr Lucien walk which she got her bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in physics [noise] she has a master's and PHD from the University of Washington She's taught at Berkeley and Princeton and now she's an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago\nSo the next time you may be in Chicago why don't you job by the Adler Planetarium it's one of the great tourist attractions and a great city of Chicago so Lucy and glad you could be on science fantastic\nOh thank you so much for having me it's a real pleasure\n[noise] okay well the first question can you is think back now as when you were a child when you were a use what do you do in the direction of science and then astronomy\n[noise] you know I ... in terms of what scared me towards astronomy I actually got my start right down the hall from you in the city College of New York but long before that I was always just a really curious kid\nUm you know I remember distinctly like hiding a loaf of bread under the couch when I was little just to like the ... what would happen [laughter] so I was doing things to try and look at the natural world around me um but when I was at the end of high school\nThe New York Academy of sciences had a summer research program for high school students and so I actually worked with your colleague Miriam Sarah check in some states it's X labs so in other words studying all the little silicon semiconductors that make up by all the cell phones and it's a wonderful technology\nIn the end of next year the U.S all as a booster rocket is going to take a trial run around the moon\nWe're going back to the moon and then after that to Mars and then the on to the asteroids maybe tightened who knows maybe to the stars\nBut which is today is Dr Lucy and walk with who's going to walk us through the steps\nOf what it would be like to be on Mars and then one day our descendants may one day visit the stars she's in a stronger whereas the Adler Planetarium she got her bachelor's from Johns Hopkins University in since extend a PHD from the University of Washington\nShe's also studied at Berkeley and at Princeton and know she'll be on the national geographic doc huge drama\nWell let's see I don't know where we last left off we were talking about going to Mars and let's see now we are on the red planet what is it like what's the weather or life on Mars what would it be like to to roam across the surface of the red planet\nWell you know I think it's a funny thing about living on Mars that the weather is whatever he make it\nMars of course has its own whether it's known of course for these very high wins and these huge global dust storms that covered the planet I'm most notably earlier this year a blotting out the opportunity rover\nI'm from view so we have a fair amount of data from our spacecraft on what the weather is like on Mars\nBut for human beings um you know Mars is not a very hospitable environment for us so if we weren't going to live there or walk around on the surface we'd have to live in some kind of habitat and that might mean you know building dome is on the surface it might mean actually building habitats\nUnder the surface into existing lava to this um and we would be able to tune the environment I to be really whatever we want it so\nYou know that means that you'd have your perfect climate controlled environment ideally anyway\nBut if you want it to go for a walk you would definitely have to have the protection of a spacesuit so again probably better than being exposed to the elements on Mars um\nBut also you know I think I'm\nAt the earth ... get used to certain things like having the experience of a breeze or that feeling of sunshine on Earth Day is so while it would be a fantastic experience from the\nStandpoint of you know you'd be walking around on an alien world um you know and then when you were home you'd have whatever your perfect climate control is you'd also miss out on that experience of\nJust being out in the wilderness I'm to be definitely\nA pretty different I think for human beings who are so used to experiencing their environment and these subtle ways\nOkay well he learned Musk the billionaire as ambitious plans to eventually put up to a million ... million calling us on the red planet starting by gradually melting the polar ice cap so once again Mars would've have water liquid water\nFreely flowing to the ancient riverbeds dried up about three billion years ago [noise]\nSo uh well what are your thoughts you think it's possible that one day we might be able to tamper with the atmosphere of Mars given the fact that it is so cold there but given the fact that to live on Mars we may eventually have to terra forming Mars like we are to reform the earth right now but what are your thoughts\n[noise] well I think it's really challenging so I Am very motivated by finding out whether\nLife they existed on any of the other bodies in the solar system and Mars for many reasons you know first and foremost that it's just really close by an astronomical terms and it's fairly easy to land on it doesn't have this very thick hot choking atmosphere the way that Venus does it\nPresents a really amazing environment to figure out whether life originated on another planet besides earth or whether that life is similar and\nEver get started there and then why not you know Mars has a lot to teach us and the thing about terra forming is that\nIt really transforms the entire environment and that means that you lose the opportunity to answer some of those questions I also think it's really challenging from um just a technical standpoint so let's say you couldn't meld all of those polar ice caps and get all of that carbon dioxide into the air\nWhere you can make the atmosphere thicker\nWell you might be able to have liquid water on the surface\nYou know that the ability to have like a lake or an ocean comes down to both temperature and also pressure\nSo you know you would be able to have liquid water on the surface but the thing is that your atmosphere would still be super dry so even though the water didn't boil off immediately like it but you know if you were to go to Mars right now and for a couple of water the water boil off and it would be gone I'm immediately but even if he had a warmer atmosphere and more pressure\nThe water would still evaporate into the atmosphere and so you would lose it pretty quickly so I think that you know one of the things that both the earth and Mars teaches us is that planets a really complicated and you know we don't\nReally have a great way of controlling the the changes that were making to the earth that environment that are making it less have not hospitable for us as he pointed out so you know I think um if\nIt's been ... for us as he pointed out so you know I think um if people want to transform the Martian environment we should think really carefully about the things that we might give up about learning about life in the universe\nAnd speaking about life in the universe first of all how we found any evidence at all even the slightest microscopic evidence of life on Mars\nAnd then recently and it was announced that there is a lay an underground lake of liquid water underneath some of the polar ice caps that's money news liquid water under the surface of Mars but well what are your thoughts about these recent discoveries\n[noise] um the lake is so exciting I'm so to answer your first question unfortunately we don't have any evidence yet that there has been life on Mars um you know I think sometimes people think that it's like a conspiracy or something like that but let me tell you you know myself and my colleague with\nTheir life on Mars ... we would be shouting at from the rooftops it would be one of the most transformative an amazing discoveries [laughter] I'm for us to ever make or whether it was past life or whether it could even be life under the surface today\nSo all we can say right now is that we don't see life on the surface but it doesn't mean that there isn't life there somewhere um we have to well literally do a little more digging\nNow as far as that underground lake I think that it's such a cool discovery in part because it it made with very similar technology that we used a steady\nUm lakes that are under the ice in the Arctic here on earth so um there are a bunch of different projects done by people who are interested in going to places like Europa this icy moon of Jupiter\nThat look for deposits of water underground I'm\nAn under ice layers and so the fact that one of these underground reservoirs they exist on Mars you know we don't know whether it\nSalty we're not really sure how much water there is there but the fact that\nThey are at all is really exciting especially because when we look at places like\nThose underground lakes that are in a in the high altitudes here on earth we often find that there's life whether it's microbial or whether there are some you know more macroscopic life like fish and stuff like that you know we find it and all of these unexpected places so maybe it could be there on Mars as well\n[noise] okay well of course I also have to ask you this question though it may be rather embarrassing for in a stronger years ago there was some commotion about a face on Mars\nAnd you can look at one of the pictures taken from a Mars orbiter it really does look side face Iraq with the features of a human face on Mars and there's even a Hollywood movie that ends as astronaut survey this and see this as a space sport\nBut you're an astronomer what are your thoughts what happened when we took a close up pictures\nOf this so called face on Mars\n[noise] well you know the thing about the face on Mars is that there is more than one picture of that rock formation right um and know whether you see a faith or not really depends on the lighting\nUp so you know sadly I I don't think that it's a space border face on Mars but you know one of the cool things about it is that\nYou know it's kind of like why um when you look at like a fire hydrant or like a hook on the back of a door or something human beings have falls to the faces all kinds of places um because it serves the fundamental function of helping us identify\nWhether there's another person around whether there might be a predator danger I really think that it's a wonderful example of the way that um our brains are very much still you know like the brains of CAVE People\nWe just you know use these same like CAVE People brands now to look at images of space um so it's kind of a a wonderful confluence of the way that the human mind at all to work and also the way that we've built technology that allows us to look at pictures of other planet [laughter] [noise]\nWell there's some people say that when we look at the potential colonization of Mars the key buzz word\nIs self sufficiency and I'll ask you about that after the commercial break once again

she's also stayed in Berkeley where I have my PHD so many years ago and also at Princeton University where also I was opposed ... many years ago\nWhere Lucy and you're also an expert not just on Mars but also on other planets circling other star systems and we've had this revolution and extra solar planets so first of all tell us\nHow many extra solar planets have we are confirmed orbiting other stars in the heavens and how many of them appear to resemble yours\n[noise] well uh we are now up to I think around three thousand confirming ... extra solar planets so most of those planets have come from a mission I worked on for many years that I I joined actually just about a decade ago right out of grad school\nJust prior to launch and that's NASA's Kepler Mission and Kepler that's far has confirmed around twenty three hundred planets with\nSeveral thousand more candidates that are still being examined like detectives to figure out whether they're in tact planets or whether they might be caused by something else and you know of those we know that there are a handful of them that are in what\nAre called the habitable zone around their star so that's where they get enough light that they could possibly be warm enough\nTo have liquid water on the surface\nBut you know not so much that they're too hot and not so much the too cold so uh sometimes also called the Goldilocks zone now the thing with Kepler is that it tells us how big those plants are in terms of size that we know that there is around thirty or so um that are around the size of the earth or so\nBut it doesn't tell us whether they actually do have liquid water or whether the atmosphere so you know I think that this linked back to like Mars and Venus and earth in our solar system for example because if you were an alien looking at our solar system and he saw these terrestrial planets\nYou would not necessarily know with a telescope like Kepler whether the earth was habitable and write like peanuts might look just as good but we know now I'm because we live right next door that Venus is hundreds and hundreds of degrees on the surface not a very hospitable place at all and certainly no liquid water\nWhereas Mars is the other side it's got a very thin atmosphere and it's very cold but to Kepler all of those planets look like they're potentially habitable\nSo the next exciting step is to be able to figure out whether those planets have atmospheres um because those atmospheres give us warm than pressure that could\nMake it possible for liquid water to exist on the surface and then what those atmospheres are made up of are they all carbon dioxide like Mars or do they have that nice mix of elements and molecules\nThat allow us to brief um like we do here on earth\nNow as I understand because of Kepler and the work of other son or as we can take a census of the Milky Way galaxy that on average on average every single star in the galaxy has a plan to going around it\nAnd there could be billions millions of Earth like earth sized planets orbiting the stars I mean don't you find that astounding realizing that in the night sky there perhaps thousands of planets is what's in your field division\nThat could be or sly and stores and you begin to wonder or are they looking back at us [laughter]\nAbsolutely you know I'm One of the things that is so amazing about Kepler you know all those numbers that I just gave you a ... you know several thousand planets et cetera um those all come from a patch of the sky it senses that was done in a patch of the sky that's about the size of your palm held up\nAt arm's late the next time you're out at night though out and put your hand up and just cover a little tiny patch with this guy and think about just the thousands of planet that we were able to find that um what taking that census gets that is\nGoing to say that we got another short commercial break but after the break we're going to continue a discussion of what's out there in the universe once again you are listening to science fantastic with professor Michio Kaku give us a call the hotline number is six one to\nFive six for aid won three five and when you hear the
