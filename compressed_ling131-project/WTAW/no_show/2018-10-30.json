have said yes there's a lot going on a lot to get to want to grab a phone call or two off the top here um and then we've got to be just the stories continue to come in about how\nYou do you think Jerry that people in\nThe news media didn't pay attention to the moving of our embassy to Jerusalem in Israel insurance on the new yes because they're actually what they do they keep on interviewing Israeli people you know dignitaries of sorts and rabbis\nAnd they think that they're going to talk badly about Donald Trump President Trump is the one that move the embassy to the rightful capital of Israel, Why why do they think that Israel doesn't like Donald Trump what do they do but I\nDon't know why you're doing that does that make sense to you would you think that not really Israel has a problem with Donald Trump I I don't I never thought that\nJust doesn't make any sense actually you know I I thought they had a brain but then again maybe I was wrong ... actually improving but I was wrong and so it's a ... go ahead\nI was gonna say you know I was really interested in the mainstream media especially after the synagogue shooting in how they were going to a\nFriend that I guess and I heard in reports that this guy was a big anti Trump guy he was not a fan whatsoever I was watching ABC or over the last two days and not one time that I hear them say that but the the it kept coming up as far as what the Trump Trump's rhetoric\nSo they held a decision because of the second amendment said people have the right to protect their homes to themselves and their stuff they have that right inherently because of the protections and the second amendment without the second amendment in Washington DC a human being still could not own a gun to they're going to have actually put together\nIn their houses keep that in mind you keep saying that the second member means nothing I'm here to tell you it means everything if it meant nothing we wouldn't be having this argument\nWell that's the thing we were arguing over over the crowds the government's left us I mean they they left the crowd was over here arguing\nOver that we're not we're not even when I started I listen I've got three on guns I've got an A R Fifteen I don't have crumbs I have guns that can really stop somebody from doing something bad to my family and\nTo me I Can't the government\nWell it depends on on how much it it depends on how much of the government is doing I think it depends on how much of the government is doing it how much that government uprising and purity is really doing and if people like you and me and our entire communities rose up of course it would mean something read the whole idea where to start with getting rid of the second amendment\nActually made the point moved from the beginning but I wanted to have a discussion with you or you haven't got anywhere with me now to be honest with you\nWell know I I'd say you let me on the air to talk about it because I mean I don't think enough people don't understand how the second amendment isn't that much power and that the and\nThe second half of it actually ... on on our art that they're not there actually are wrong\nAnd has a lot of power I just give you a prime example ... decision but he did but you chose not to listen to Tony appreciates let's do it again I Do appreciate you wanted to mix it up I like that but the whole idea that it doesn't mean anything is wrong I think his point was the government has so much overwhelming force it doesn't matter\nAnd I hear what he's saying and I hear where he's coming from I'm not going to buy that because there were three hundred twenty million of us\nOkay and and there's a government that's pretty big but it's about two and a half million people\nAre and when you break down what the armed forces are a lot of people in the armed forces would leave the armed forces if the government ever said go kill all the people take their guns\nUm but we we certainly would have a fighting chance because of the second amendment open never comes to that I don't see that happening but the argument that it doesn't mean that you're going to the shooter doesn't ring true for

the spirit of the second amendment as was ... by our failures back in the game was not skits and hand grenades people we've that part out\nTo spirit was that the average everyday citizens would have what the foot soldier could carry into combat that ties directly into us keeping ourselves from having a over radical government\nWell I think that's also that's also an incident Scalia said in his ruling he said um that if you or I see them in several interviews of course before he passed but he said the way I see the second amendment is if you can carry it\nIf you can keep it and you can hold it you can Barrett vintage covered by the second amendment so when people say tanks and ... teams and everything else they're not they're not talking to a second language\nAnd it's absolutely true

on where we need to be carrying a weapon comparable to military style weapons the 'cause you can't pay yourself against the military with the peace either or one round and magazine\nAnd critically died at the fact that we didn't get invaded after Pearl Harbor because our society with our where they talked about invading us and the general advised not to because they are they're the Bush or gotten behind every Bush\nYeah that's absolutely true why do we keep saying the shooter can you in the last caller stumped sleepy shooter my goes earned the shooters or I go ahead what else\nI I said that because of him and that's what I'm saying I Know if we're if we're limited to one round that are married or two shot there was that way we could find ourselves in it or or adversaries or our

second amendment yeah\nI'm a retired at thirty nine years since March of ... ... and\nThey take that away from us and try to take it away I'm right that going to see a civil war right here mess in the United states\nWell I I Would never be successful to take it away and it was there it sounds like there's a big push to do it but it's a it's a very small minority of people I was just going anywhere man\nOr you know a while back somebody\nI think it was all panicky or it'll rain was yesterday I bail where there's a clause in our second ma'am and she was all years that it takes a hand guns are way\nYes you can't put a clause in the second amendment list of states all agree to change the constitution and that wasn't going to happen\nAss right and a lot of the more you know I Believe if yeah tall\nI voted for Trump I Believe in you know\nAnd uh if Trump was huge pressure natural hours and arrest everybody with you that had anything to do with uranium\nOn I think that would shut the whole

after the Clintons right now\nBut he did forget it I mean do you see an uprising here like we haven't seen the very long time you're already seeing it because the media's freaking out but if you want to bring indictments and they have people like did the rights I'm all for it but if this is going to be some elongated investigation\nHe's not gonna be doing himself but he favors now I don't want her to get away scot free I Want that entire thing to be exposed\nBut um I I I don't know the\nThe last thing you want to see him do is stopping to lose my executive powers and go after this thing when he was doing so well in all of his other duties we don't want to give them something to focus on to be honest with you on the left I I actually ah Michael I appreciate your service I really do appreciate what you had to say but ... you know investigation and progressive vision for best occasion after\nNow we're going to teach everybody now are going to do it enough let's take away the BS for a second and realize how successful this guy who's been in fewer than two years and under two years with this guy has done is startling\nWhen you get new unemployment numbers this Friday the economic numbers are crazy three and a half percent GDP four point two percent you know the the previous quarter I mean that's nuts\nThat's unbelievable blessed are going to use a okay well the focus of his presidency was the investigation into this no we need to rise above that and say look at how great he is doing look at how what are standing in the world look what our economy is doing I think that's the smart play here\nIt's like when people used to call in because they wanted to give me the reasons why they believed\nThat rock Obama was born in Kenya and I'd stop them and I'd say stop it I don't know where he was born you know where he was born gotta burst says Hawaii and I got another ... says Hawaii that people who say they were witnesses of it and and he is the president so let's\nThat people say they were witnesses of it and and he is the president so let's not hang our hat on that let's focus on what he's doing in the job and his job performance was so bad that it was easy to talk about what it was he wasn't doing for this country\nYou would get you could focus on this fantasy about him not being born here or or what this person was forging numbers did we did the other thing and all that other crap or you can charities in the job it's now our job to make sure people understand how bad he is at this\nAnd that's what I was employing people to do so I'm not here to say get away with uranium one I'm not here to say get away with wrongdoing and in horrible things what I'm saying is you wouldn't do that in the background and not publicize it maybe but in the foreground in the forefront we must keep and the president must keep\nPromoting the positive things that are happening but by the way if negative things start happening I'll report them here but so far so good when it

stop\nI Believe I'm going to say it I Believe the fake news media is the enemy of the people when you report that the president didn't visit Steve ... in the hospital and he and the first we were there visiting him at the time\nThat's bad\nAnd misleads people therefore I think is the enemy of the people when you show a picture of Republicans and Democrats praying\nAt second base and you report

your video at ... you were a great\nOh man it was pretty awesome and Motown ... and like I said the waves come they don't let that fake news media like us out of the like twenty six teams\nEverybody it's your buddies that at a vote because it caravan coming in its day yet hey we got to stop playing word game and we use that word loaf\nTwo bullets to shoot it here in San about that it's about protecting our freedoms and liberties and the founding fathers are smart enough to make sure there was a mechanism in place that would allow us to do just that\nBut what solution if you're the decider what solutions when you come up with right now and by the way if you're a lefty that really does believe gun control and more gun laws will somehow solve the problem I'm listening\nFill me in bringing that common sense and logic that you think you have that will stop this from happening because it carried Jimmy Kimmel will come out tonight complain about this and do something Congress\nAs he's protected by good guys with guns they'll say that in his monologue tonight so well Trevor Noah so we'll Steven cold there so will a chef what's his face Myers and I don't watch any of them out a lot of New York's give me fell in ... I'm a fan of\nI just can't watch these people anymore because\nThey aren't entertaining Baron fund that'll make you laugh I don't get your Waverly Bailey Jimmy Fallon does\nIt last time I saw him anyway but I remember him apologizing for messing up the president's hair and I found that to be weird I found that to be odd so all of these people protected by guns including members of Congress and governors and mayors there are all out there talking smack\nAs they're protected by good guys with guns\nSo I'm yet to hear a real solution from somebody and all that look if you're the left you have a solution and listen to\n... I'll say it again what I've said many times rock Obama in my lifetime was the worst president he may be the worst president in modern times Jimmy Carter is a close second Jimmy Carter who by the way still injecting myself in in uh in in news and in issues\nYou were bronco bomber was a horrible president\nRuin the economy divided us and the lines of race does it like how we got here Haiti colonialism just complain does if slavery ended yesterday not a hundred and fifty years ago\nVery strange what he did he did it with a smile and he did it is very cool like a rock star so people found all over him and just didn't even pay any attention when he was doing he was a horrendous president but I agree with him when he was right\nI agree with him several times three or four times get bin Laden I agree with him kill bin Laden\nI Can't see it like if the if this president was the one that found bin Laden that he killed him trust me or give you order to kill them trust me the left would say it was a horrible thing how dare he he hates Muslims I'm telling you that's what they would do\nBut when bronco bother did it I said well listen that was the right call call you had to make absolutely when rock Obama said let's cap CEO pay five hundred thousand dollars if you borrowed money for the taxpayers I agreed with him pay the\nTax payers back first then pay your CEO or whatever you want to pay him but if you borrow money from me you're not gonna give this guy ten million a year what are you stupid I agreed with him I thought that was smart I agreed with him when he said take out the pirates off the coast of Somalia that border American vessel I agreed with him\nYou know you could agree with people that you generally speaking politically aligned with you can agree with them when they're right when rock Obama said marriage as between one man and one woman as he was running for president two thousand they agreed with him\nI did\nTotally so listen\nAnd ... that's all about a blind squirrel finding a nut I mean that's that's about him really taking the rights stance on a few different issues the rest of the time he was a radical that was trying to change the country from the inside out because he hated how we were founded\n\nSo when this president does the right thing like there's not a whole lot about blacks it today you know a black suit is Carrie\nYeah I've heard of that that yeah you're right and see anything in in the news about it\nMuch of black people went to the White House young black conservatives went to the White House\nTo show that they are not going to be on the Democratic plantation anymore it's getting very little if any coverage in the news it was getting any coverage the coverage is a panel of black folks complaining about how stupid they the other folks were for going to the White House that's weird\nAlison camera on CNN when she was on Fox she wasn't this person knowing CNN she is actually asked um somebody from I guess the person who runs the synagogue the president's talking about possibly coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue would you welcome\nHim carry why would you ask that question would you welcome him you know not being a question I Would ask\nLittle bit loaded no I mean you're looking for an answer their ... and his answer was absolutely he's my president why wouldn't they wanted to come here and that was the right answer but she expected he might say no he should stay away\nWell listen if even if you're on the far left and you're a Democrat who happens to be Jewish you know this president's looked at for Israel you know this president has a history of working very well with and loving Jews so pretending like he's something other than that is stupid it's just dumb\nHe's the only president out of twelve who promised that who really moved our embassy to Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel\nYet Alison Kim around a thought that the rabbi at that synagogue would not want this guy at the center God that's so weird it's become now just asking that question tells me she's probably a member of the fake news media they won't do any harm to happen to her absolutely not\nDo I want her to be called out for badly doing the job or purposely misleading sure we can do that why not\nSo the whole idea that you must now sees on this crisis as a woman Bengal said never let a serious crisis go to waste you should seize on this crisis and make it all about Trump negative negative negative negative it was Trump\nLecture let's ignore that walk away that big get together happen in Washington is that the widely reported the walk away march yeah there are a lot of people they're renting struck was the guy that we had on here he's the founder of that of that whole movement and they had a great turnout not being covered by anybody\nSo is there fake news media you damn skippy when you ignore those things those positive things when you downplay the great economic numbers\nThen you get mad when somebody calls you offered missed reporting or being stupid get over yourselves but I really do want to hear some commonsense logical solution\nYou stupid get over yourselves but I really do want to hear some commonsense logical solutions to how we keep people safe for these soft targets and if the solution is not to have more good guys with guns fill me in on

and cause major ethic but what I Do believe in it a simplistic belief system if this guy with a whole and so I ...\nYou know and any more than I Believe and the idea of a guy with a long beard and a long slow and a guy and ... you know that that's what I don't I don't believe in that Luttrell\nApproach but the problem but they call into late was that almost all of them were evangelicals and most of them were extremist evangelicals I actually looking forward\nTo you know the rapture and judgment day the end of days all that kind of thing might say and cut they basically were encouraging that to happen because from that perspective you know the damons rebate fated everyone will go to heaven or at least the ones who believe\nYou know and they they were totally driven by that belief system um and anything that came that way and he died they essentially forced it to go into the paradigm that they believed in um that they that they had no um shame about doing that at all\nWhat are you thinking about June because I Know that uh you know you're looking at a that's a different type of a it's not really a demon would you know it's kind of a I guess I don't know what you call it the supernatural entity that's been conjured or at least brought forward\nAnd that's what I'm thinking a lot of this might be too is that the ... you could be the arrival of June perhaps\nWell yeah I mean I think you know um you have to ... you know in the vein but damons the devil in the in the Christian Bible and under a multiple other religions around the world have their own diet change in their own equivalent almost\nOf heaven and hell [noise] um [noise] so you know in that sense\nYou know you can you can just look at different cultures and countries and realized that you know that there are belief systems life is\nAll around the world I'm to the college\nThey laid the belief system was not a belief system it\nWas an absolute fact and um and that's one of the things I pointed out in the book was [laughter] but um\nYou know they they they didn't really ... the phenomena that date today investigated it budge information that they didn't sit well in that scenario they ignored things that Dave sits in that scenario they embraced it yeah it's all about the only the best way to go about it right\nBut they really needed remove vital organs and they removed the blood for mutilated cattle\nUh but uh you know I just was wondering if there was any a paramilitary units that may have been involved with you know you've heard of ... labs are my labs where we you know we have the alien get we're working with the with the military\nAnd uh you know the question is now you know they're they're asking questions about whether or not these aliens that we the graves of course we're uh I guess you'd say they're synthetic they're not they're not a ...\nAh I guess you'd be synthetic they're not they're not biological what do you think about that idea\nWell I mean it's an interesting theory I mean I'm you know they do kind of come across as sort of a lot almost like we're could drones you know I'm so that that's an interesting theory I'm now as far as the ... was concerned that you was that\nThey sort of tiles a big rise abducting paypal and things like that\nThey came to conclude that's what he was\nBasically all in the mind and by that a domain papal having by dreams they believed that the the demonic entities with project imagery into the minds of painful and at night and I would believe that I Would have them believe they would take it on\nBoard flying saucers UFOs and subject to\nGenetic experiments and when I asked one of the guys why they believe that I did that\nUm and they said he was to encourage the extra terrestrial angle of damons we're trying to I'm encouraged belief in the existence of aliens that we're\nTaking paypal and abducted them and taking that Jane's and day and I had an etcetera etcetera but I Believe that none of that ever happened they believed it was all like a projection in the human mind to try and\nEncourage people to believe that theory and the mood I believed in the extra terrestrial angle it allowed the damons to um do whatever they wanted to do without being exposed to what I really where at least to they they um Collins elites are personal view on all those\nWho do we have like heritage you know you have to be very ... the be all these ... these goblins if you will coming out of the woodwork ... whenever they will with them\nYeah and it's interesting that over the centuries and cultures and countries they change you know um it's ferries each goblins it's damons saying give us you know it's basically it's that and today it's highly ends\nAnd um that's the the colors relate noted that aspect quite closely and ... that's the reason why there were these different types of entities all over the centuries and different cultures and countries was because they should they should that you don't mind I should stress that but they came to believe\nThat they be entities themselves a paper was saying again we're sort of created images\nAgain designed to create an image in the mind of their personal the targeted paypal\nAnd to keep them as far away from as possible from the ... the demonic truth as they saw it\nAnd that they would you know I'm sort of project these images of goblins ferries you know I'm ... kind of thing things that you know today we just say as you know entertaining stories fairy tales but by then\nYou know five hundred years ago those kinds of stories were taken very seriously by the papal those areas\nUm so lot of that was sort of um compiled into the belief system all the ... late um and\nYou know a lot of it was extremely other said extremely controversial um you know I never read I only ever saw one of the guy interviewed about seven right of the guys are ... to various times in the group\nAnd as far as I can tell at one point\nThe number of papers in the great was justified seven or writes\nAnd edits heights at least at one point it was so my pops in the thirties maybe in the forties but it wasn't like a\nAs I said he wasn't a group that had an agency or a big building a huge funding\nThat you know um but I Would have meetings in sort of you know in a in a way a robot operator range for them and I prepared reports and and then handed over to whoever\nWould find it interesting budge inside and all that you know they they were sort of deep into it and I'm a lot of that theories you know very\nControversial as I said I'm of the seven or eight papal who I'd worked in the group\nI'm over various decades I only have a so\nOne of the guys sort of crack a joke or or have a smile you know they were totally living in sort of like a a completely Blake world as I saw a face they saw themselves as sort of a ... of the human rice\nUm the human rights could only be saved by having a sort of almost like a slave TNN old\n... all the Old Testament sort of blood and thunder kind of I'm starting to fade wrath of God and I felt that the world has to be pushed down that path way\nBecause it was the only way to save the human race so you know the answer really walk to ideas along those lines you know you've got to do this we've got to push the human rights down this path why\nDo we need to save them that was basically their approach\nWould not be the same time about it do they see lately uh maybe there are few out there on the call you or anyone on street do would be there to actually not gone towards asking do you think that's happening\nOh yeah I mean the whole issue of eschatology as I pointed out to the book there's an entire chapter on that the the guys in the group where you know eschatology and ... days judgment day\nThe rapture all of that kinda stuff cyber obsessed with that and I felt that the the way to save paypal was not to sort of you know use rockets and missiles to destroy metal UFOs or whatever\nThat belief system was that if we could if they could suck bleep it by Bates convince us of you know that I particularly like an Old Testament kind of wrath of God\nA type of situation where we all need to live in a an leaving Fe or\nThey felt that that would ensure our cells would make sure we went to heaven and so they felt they were doing the right thing\nUm but you know at the end of the day it comes down to the fact that its base of belief systems on that part now as I said\nI only saw one of the guys crack a joke once and not that was when I actually said you know where did you get the name they call it the late ... or as I pointed out to the book but ... not cold they call in the late that was a nickname that they use then I said well why did you used a nickname and he came from the fact that it's\nOne of the guys in the group it was one of the uh late papal brought him to the program um was a guy who lived in this little town in New York called Collins\nAnd if you look up Collins' New York the town for decades the entire town they'll the town's population almost everybody would tend to chase factory and I'm literally in the chase factory this one guy um who is working with this group\nYou know he had sort of he was a lot they viewed him as long as the elites of the town everybody else's working in the ... industry he had the secret job looking for demons and so they viewed him as a lot of the elites of Collins of this little town\nDamons and so they viewed him as a lot of the elites of tall instead this little town and then it became the ... late it was just like he was getting so inside joke um about this one guy and this little town well in in the army\nOr like I said that's the only time I have a them crack a joke the rest of the time it was just Graham um situations you know we have to do something to to prevent this sort of demonic angle growing and growing\nWell and and they may have been aware of that and as I said at the beginning of the program before have you on Collins name itself a news back to the dramatic times of the service and uh basically uh the the idea that\nThe original Collins a family the uh the the original name meant ... a medicine then the men who were there to\nUh take the blood and give the blood pretty much a and they have a symbol that was true in a ... I'm a serpent on a team which of course the you know a lot of the vampire legend come\nFrom a the calling names that just like for example dark shadows\nColin ... and all that all comes from that that means itself the blood line one of blood lines of this of they say the women on the big red for with a sit down at ground zero Tripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred Tripoli fix him at three thirty seven hundred back more ground zero don't go away [noise]\n\nSteve that me down here\nWhat are you a yellow buggy I met ...

had great toughness we played physical in the game to game was physical and both sides hating tackling running block aiming everybody was competing extremely hard we just didn't play well enough and execute well enough and and the critical time\nThe way a little bit more from coach coming up also find Texas Aggie soccer is back in action today taking on South Carolina in the SEC tournament so we'll cover that as well some NBA coming up in sports\nWell I mean it's just like the New England patriots the Boston Red Sox apparently cheating during the world's ...\nAh there's apparently some circulating videos accusing the pictures of cheating ... yeah Matt Barnes ... apparently has some sticky substance on his forearm oh any touches\nIt with his pitching hand before each pitch\nFor you know it was apparently an Astros fan that pointed this out oh lay in the ... uh-huh and he said now watch it and sure enough there it look because you can tell kind of the sheen or whatever on his arm already all sweaty right with a little different and yet he wouldn't mention every time well\nAnd then there's David Price who apparently was patting you share it with his hand in his hand\nAppears to stick to his Jersey my oh that's so terrible yeah likely of course for major league baseball to do anything about it going to ask you know they're going to have a big party in Boston and you don't you don't want to get\nTheir own and that's at the ... are you going Bostonians on the party no not at all so anyway and uh I mean\nIt's just sad it really is it they just stay the case they beat them that's all there is to it All right let's say this move on to politics so the president's going to Pittsburgh today ... and I'm a pretty good piece of advice I heard yesterday from Dana Perino Dana Perino used to be the\nPress secretary for a President Bush forty three [noise] she said when things go wrong in the country it's the president's job to make\nPeople feel better and writing and Ronald Reagan was great at that book cause he was older than the majority of the population\nHe was kind of like this comforting person needs a comforting grandpa exactly who could make you feel better when something bad happened right well\nHe's Trump started that way yesterday and then he decided to get off into the ditch about the media again and she said he really missed an opportunity to be very presidential at this time\nBecause he just can't control is now right so I I thought that was a that was very fair and very honest and very true right I mean there are\nTimes that you know you you can be you and maybe the way Trump aides but there are times where you need to be that comfort\nOr if you are the the leader of the country and stay off of Twitter yeah what else they a lot wetter wetter ... for the rest of that certain might gundy Israel organ or yeah\nOr you will do that later if you're not doing it in the sports than I Do not okay\nSo anyhow so he's going to go into Pittsburgh today and I thought that the rabbi from the synagogue a said the proper thing that he is my president I'm an American he's my president and he is welcome here yeah ... ... again heat heat tamped that down the way that he should All right let's get on to stuff that's a well a little\nDifferent or lawyers for state senator Charles ... said yesterday\nThat ah of course he's under fire for sending a lewd messages to a University of Texas student a he has submitted his phone to a forensic examiner who's determined that the photos and the text and question could not have come from the senators phone\nOkay ... examiner sorry Scott yeah exactly why would they need a forensic person that\nWell I don't I'm not sure of every three or digital forensics of Austin determine that and this was a news release that came from or the governor's a excuse me the the senators attorneys\nSo uh we'll see representatives from uh UT have declined to acknowledge or comment on the investigation\nCiting a need to protect the integrity of the process of spokesman also declined to comment on Monday read wit lift who's the president of three or digital forensics in Austin for Monday evening that the firm has examined the senators phone\nSo that's basically where we are isn't it didn't come from his phone and if that's a good enough answer for you then we're going to move on but we did ask the governor about this last week\nAnd they do need to get it settled one way or the other they gotta they gotta take care of this situation right before the session starts in January because uh we need to have a senator in place that uh is not facing some sort of a\nA situation like this so we'll see and again it's it's being done by the timeline office in UT so they got a lot of stuff to do and they move with their own pace and that's one of the ... or a friday in the Dallas Morning news they could take up to eleven months to have this taken care of\nAll that I don't know how to build now yeah that's not acceptable we need to have this situation taking care\nRight well and for both sides accuser Andy accused I mean that is just a really long time and then like you said because at\nThat elections in that position the end for you know constituents to be able to vote on a you know clean slate I get right to say I will have it set out to have yeah yeah I settled you know to know what they're yeah\nWell and look at how the FBI intervening in the presidential election with the the charges holding over Hillary Clinton's head throughout that I mean look how that affected the outcome possibly I mean I'm not going to say that that was the entire reason but you know you can't help but think did some\nSure um UT Texas Tribune poll out Texas voters opinions of a President Trump a mirror which you probably would expect Republicans like him Democrats do\nMirror which you probably would expect Republicans like him Democrats down in that yeah I has does he have the temperament to service president eighty one percent of Republicans say yes six percent of Democrats\nThat probably says it right there and you had a however\nFor temperament forty four percent said that he did is he competed fifty one percent of all voters that he is confident\nDa Nang taxes and All right\nCourse eighty eight percent of the Republicans said yes ten percent of the Democrats said no is he a strong leader fifty one percent of all voters said yes Ninety One percent of Republicans said yes so\nUm there's other stuff in there without having to talk about it now but uh apparently short a short version of it is\nA Texans think we we need to stop the immigration situation we need to stop it now so there'll be more news about the fact that so that's yes in that case exactly right compared to California in ah in Arizona I Would say that's probably right six forty a\nThis is Neil spirit and I'll be back with today's split Texas right after a word from our sponsor is friends at

I'm telling you were having a conversation you keep on assertive in prop ... I got to tell you I keep on asserting things and you're afraid to answer my questions regarding the learning things ... years have\nBeen very stupid honestly word I'm trying to have a really cool conversation with you you've gotten four minutes so far which is two minutes more\nThen I give most people most people get a man and a half two minutes I'm willing to have your argument with you then you go to international law then you go to France and when I tried to re bought anything you say you're getting mad do calmed down your I've only got about another minute and a half\nAgo I have to go to break William make your point as to how I Am wrong without inciting international law and the hay and friends tell me what I missing when it says persons born here\nAnd and or subject to the jurisdiction there up because as soon as the person was born here they're subject to the jurisdiction there up if they're born in my studio they're born in Texas they're born in the United states of America they are subject to the laws here\nI'm not missing it but if you think I Am so totally wrong about your interpretation you're wrong about what you're thinking and your thought processes that I don't care what your opinion is telling me factually why I'm wrong and I'll hear you good\nSubject to the jurisdiction there is superfluous an unnecessary language if you simply say born there has to be meaning attached to that phrase if you're born here boom that's it that's why I have that language\nLA's your question do you do don't ask me a rhetorical question to answer you this actually was going for foreign dignitaries this was for if somebody is a Saudi ambassador and they're in the in the ... there in this country they're subject to their own jurisdiction they're not necessarily\nSubject or law across the only word says that show me where it says that\nLet's say you don't want to look\nTo show me where it says that that's where that's where it\nWill tell you this I Believe that you think I'm wrong and I can I can appreciate that I Know that what I said is right and your way of delivering it was nasty and angry and I'm not really sure why let me like a brother to get off my phone I don't understand why you had to get like that I mean I'm more than willing to listen to you\nKnow when it comes to a foreign dignitaries that person comes in and says okay I'm going to represent my nation and Mike capital and Mike king near my whatever my president and I'm not ... are not subject to the same jurisdiction as you are I get that\nAnd that actually does diplomatic immunity that makes a lot of sense this however is not a degree Terry this is the person who know exist because he or she was born here we must change the fourteenth\nCongress generally has what's called winery authority over immigration matter which means blanket authority it's an open question whether Congress could provide that the children of those born here illegally are not granted citizenship I support that approach I support a statute that does that now we passed a statute to do that it would\nAbsolutely and certainly be challenged in court and it's possible court would strike it down that that is a good faith legal dispute that I that ultimately to be resolved at the Supreme Court but but I ... I support whatever approach get the job\nResolved at the Supreme Court but but I ... I support whatever approach get the job done which is to change the the under wise policy a birthright citizenship that just encourages illegal immigration I\nA couple of months ago was that was that a detention facility uh down in Brownsville and and and there ... there were several\nInfants who had been born there because very pregnant women had crossed over here legally look it's not a good system to be encouraging women who were eight nine months pregnant to be dealing a hard arduous journey with with human trafficker that that that's not a compassionate system\nAnd yet there were several infants who had just been bored or to two young women in in many cases teenagers who had just recently crossed over here legally\nAnd he's a Senator Ted Cruz running for reelection one week from today what what's interesting about this this reelection campaign that you put on there is a bit of a distance between you and Robert Francis award but\nThey're trying anything that I just had a guy on earlier this hour\nWho whose organization put together a pamphlet showing where you stand on being pro life when and where you spend on all the laws of immigration where you stand on the economy in taxation and then on the other side they had were were ... and he's with students who are those the Texans don't generally want\nSomebody stole that entire\nPainful if we do to make you look bad and make him look good but even left the website the same underhanded stuff like this was happening in a lot of places people stealing your your yard signs to replace human would veto science\nHow did you get through that garbage when you know the people are pushing so hard to to keep the truth from those who will go and vote\nWell you're right that there is a lot of anger and there's a lot of desperation on the far left and and I think that they see that that the momentum in this race is is is headed\nIn the right direction which is away from their extreme and radical a policy proposals and and and back to the common sense values\nThat Texans have always believed in low taxes low regulations lots of jobs\nSecure the border and defend the constitution\nAnd and I I've seen those same flier mentioned for Asian American you know that that you've got these knocked off Raj where ... where it clearly with somebody supporting Beto O'Rourke that was just producing fraudulent voter guy then and and so\nThey look they're always going to be unscrupulous try to live and try to try to deceive at the end of the day\nWe need to focus on the truth we need to focus on substance you know I'm right now in the middle of a bus tour were traveling the entire state of Texas barn storming the state we started the day and you ... we were in Del Rio with just arrived in San Angelo and I got to tell you where the impacts crowds yesterday\nWe ... we were down in the Rio Grande valley we had two thousand people come out in the Harlem with two thousand people come out in Michigan I mean there was an excitement and enthusiasm weighed over a thousand come out ... so I mean\nWe're seeing people energized and we just need to make sure that common sense conservatives that freedom loving Texans come out to the cold and what I Would say to your listeners is early vote come out in early ... if you haven't done it do it tomorrow do it today do it tomorrow but get it done and then then get your friends and family and neighbors in St\nLouis we aren't really voted today than it was easy it was a streamlined process we voted for you absolutely\nBut as you want your competitors at last we spoke you said it was thirty million dollars in his coffers I've seen numbers as high as eighty million dollars you'd hardly get this guy to cross the finish line that's that's almost disgusting because so much of it\nHas come from outside of our state how is it the you're maintaining a lead against that kind of financial backing\nWell you're absolutely right it is massive masses of money he has raised over Seventy million dollars altogether the thirty million was just last quarter and the third quarter erase thirty at night at one quarter ... north of Seventy altogether and they're\nLighting the state with cash a Hollywood liberals are all behind it by the way you got a lot of listeners in San Antonio let me get a great reason for any any person in San Antonio to vote for me which is if you saw at the Lakers spurs game LeBron\nJames showed up for the state or have we got an ... an MBA player [laughter]\nTrying to beat the spurs that's a great reason not to vote for a Democrat is get up to Hollywood liberal\nBy the way he was in the old Columbus now do you most of the spurs twice in a week\nOr do do the brawn James so so so that that goes a long way to it's Ted Cruz of course the Republican the great state of Texas\nRunning for reelection right now how do you feel going going going cross the finish line here I Know you're gonna be traveling for the next week like crazy shaken hands kissing babies I mean you and I haven't talked since the big massive rally in Houston were a hundred thousand people signed up for Eighteen thousand seats how do you feel going in\nA ... well outside the rally was incredible as you said with a hundred thousand people ... who signed up for tickets every where we're going we're seeing real enthusiasm what's happened in the last two months but then the people of Texas are really focused on the issues and and my record versus ... rocks record is is Knight and day I've led the fight\nFor lower taxes lower regulations and we're seeing record low unemployment we've got the lowest African American unemployment that it's ever been recorded we've got the lowest Hispanic unemployment that it's ever been recorded Texas is booming and Texans want to keep that them do and we also\nWant to secure the border bait or works agenda his voting record supports higher taxes higher regulation killing jobs especially in oil and gas which is devastating protects us and and supporting open borders I none of that is is is good for our country\nI couldn't agree more it's a it's a Senator Ted Cruz Republican the great state of Texas Ted I\nWatch these ads and who's answered basically whose face on a screen it's very odd to me if he's not running a skateboard is just his face\nAnd I'm not really sure that that's enough to pull them over the over the top here but as they watch these ads he continues that that whole line about you know the the whole rainbows in puppies and what was the blind squirrel but his daughter is is nursing back to health but he also says things like John Cornyn and I haven't worked together on this\nThat and the other I'm going to be hurt my interview with the with the senior senator the other day recording said no I'm I'm a retired guy I'm not sure why they do is saying you know you certainly I've I've shaken hands across the aisle with people trying to get good legislation done protections but what about that when somebody on on the opposite side pretend like he's got support from your side\nI look I mean ... campaign is trying to do everything they can just see the voters of Texas so I you know John Cornyn ... you know it has been barn storm in the state with me down a bunch of rally side by side with me and he and I worked together very closely\n... you saw the debate in fact the fact that Joe the last debate we did and Senate telling you you you you hosted the rally after right were beta stood up and had the goal to say that people should elect him because he'll work with President Trump right I I mean it's truly a laugh line I mean there needed to be recorded audio [laughter] this is a man\nWho is the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country it was called bring teaching President Trump right as as far as I Know they never met Donald Trump if he had I'm not aware of that he just he just sits in the house\nAnd throws partisan a hand grenades and then claims oh I can work with Republicans really had an accomplish\nWhat next anything in the house and in fact that you want to contrast my record with those record\nHe and I were both elected to Congress on the exact same\nDay that the people think that he's a newcomer and you're the old guy it was the same date wasn't it it was the ...\nThink that he's a newcomer and you're the old guy it was the same date was that it\nIt was the exact same day we both served six years in the United States Congress and one of the big differences in those six years I have offered in past thirty or different pieces of legislation major victory for the people of Texas they do this time is better back bench or I can you recall\nA single thing he's talked about this entire campaign that he's accomplished I mean look I Know it didn't introduce legislation they renamed the court house\nYeah but I mean he\nDoesn't have a record of accomplishment\nWhat he has a record of it is is going to the extreme left he has a record of up calling for teaching the president and talking about abolishing eye and praising NFL players for protesting the national anthem right which by the way as why LeBron James in Hollywood celebrities are so excited with him because because they\nThey support protesting during the national anthem was that's not Texas and and I got to tell you one of the reasons we had two thousand people in Harlem get a two thousand people in mission it is in Texas Hispanics in Texas where a conservative community right and and and they do in the media pretending you get is panic boats by\nRunning far left and supporting open borders in the end of the of socialism and attacking police officers and an undermining law enforcement of undermining veterans and that's just wrong we support law enforcement we support our veterans that Texas yeah\nWhat's that I support you voted for you today hopefully listening right now we're going early voting going on on Tuesday obviously going to be long lines that the best of what my friend let's talk again soon\nBang bang you might read I'll tell you one thing quickly hide and I went and voted on Sunday with early voted\n... never prior election I did not fact vote for myself because the nets instance Katherine my youngest daughter pushed the cat ballot", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "College
