world than touching our lives and once again in this hour well this hour eat your our that's right\nYou can pick up the phone that perhaps you can get on science fantastic so why should the marsh such science proceed without you why didn't you to be part of it why should we scientists have all the fun exploring the secrets of Mother Nature and how it impacts on all of our lives\nSo give us a call the hotline number is six one to five six for eight one two three five right that number down six one to five or six or eight one thirty five and but surely your name\nSix when to buy six for eight one thirty five and but surely drew name\nCalled later to the radio station if you're listening to one and the city you're calling from and asked that question make that comment and perhaps you weren't sauce on the road on almost a hundred and radio stations that carries science fantastic so\nGive us a call and once you get into this hour we're going to throw the lines open you're not going to get a busy signal that get a recording and just see the earnings call in to the radio station and the city you're calling from and then asked that question that you've always wanted\nTo ask but never had the opportunity but say you having dinner with the kids and the kids ask you a homerun question that leaves you stumped what are you going to do looking like in any you know you're going to get to the phone call six one to\nFive or six for a one three five and hey why don't you put your kids on the telephone and why don't you have them ask that question\nAnd so once again everything is fair game some people say well I'm kind of embarrassed because I have some other goofy ideas and people are going to laugh at me well hey chances are\nYou have a strange weird idea\nChanges are thousands of people have that same weird crazy idea and so why didn't you share is on the airwaves and sometimes these crazy ideas well they're not so crazy\nI like to tell you about the fact that years ago there was a sixteen year old boy who was himself a stupid question and that is can you out raised to like being now come on give me a break right now this was sixteen year old boy asked himself that question can you regionalized being\nWell he ... he didn't know the answers so he went to college learn something called max equations and from then you found the solution to the problem\nWell he was twenty six years old when he finally got the answer you published a paper perhaps one of the most important papers in human history his name was Albert Einstein theory was relativity theory that gives us the atomic bomb\nThe energy source of the stars the theory of the universe itself\nAll because the sixteen year old boy as himself a stupid question\nAnd therefore what is off the balloon where does off the blue and is your third dimension now if you're a bug living on the surface of the balloon you can only see two dimensions forward backwards left and right\nBecause the balloon is the universe the building is everything there is\nWhere is the universe or the bubble or the balloon expanding into\nExpanding you to the third dimension now that the bugs cannot see the third dimension the bugs I can only see two dimensions but is expanding into the third dimension the third dimension of space\nNow Einstein says our universe is a four dimensional bubble so what is it expanding into the system that you\nKnow you can see the sister mentioned just like bugs cannot see off the balloons but that's what the universe seems to be expanding into\nAnother theory which explains is called string theory string theory has not been verified now the expanding universe theory of course had been verified it every time we look at the galaxies in outer space\nShake theory is up and verify shakes Uri actually predicts that the universe is expanding into a lesson dimensions\nNot just for not just five but a leather dimensions and so think of a bubble bath of universes so our universe is a bubble and it's floating among other bubbles out there\nNow this explains I think a resolution between two it was a great paradigms of religion in the Christian religion we have genesis in Buddhism we have nerve Anna\nNow my parents were Buddhist and Buddhism there is no beginning there is no and there's only states have consciousness called nerve ana\nBut I was raised as a Presbyterian as a child\nAnd every Sunday I went to Sunday school and I learned about genesis and the fact that the universe had a beginning an instant\nWin gods said let there be like so how can you reconcile these opposite point of view to totally opposite points of view one in which there is no beginning only states of consciousness no beginning no and\nAnd the other one being a definite point whether the universe began well the multiverse idea coming out of the things here explains it\nBecause you see our universe our bubble had an origin it had a big bang there was a moment when the universe came into existence but there are other bubbles out there and what is it expanding into nerve Anna something beyond the bubble nerve Anna\nInto nerve Anna something beyond the bubble nerve Anna that is a letter to mention all hyper space\nAnd so she says basically that all the particles are nothing but vibrations on the tiny tiny little vibrating strings\nThat physics the laws of harmony the strings\nThat chemistry is amenities you can play on these vibrating strings the universe is a symphony of strings and the mind of God that Einstein wrote about in in his letters and his memoirs the mind of God wouldn't be cause make music resonating\nTo eleven dimensional hackerspace so the next time you go into a planetarium and the children asked that question if the universe is getting bigger and bigger than what is it expanding into you can give them\nThe thought that well perhaps is hyper space the universe is expanding in another dimension okay well let's move right onto the next listener phone call\n... kind of things you on a juicy on we're going to ask a workout or your theory years on actually my theory that the reason why ... ...

scientific discoveries which are revolutionizing our world and touching our lives\nNow let me ask you questions how many times have you watched the TV listen to radio surf the Web and something pops up they can use your curiosity something about technology about science and medicine about the future\nAnd you're all alone\nYou have no one to talk to is just to you and the Internet you have the TV set\nWell here's your chance to talk back here's your chance to give me a call waiting to call me at six one to five or six for eight months three five and all we ask can view is that he leave your name college or the radio station and the city you're calling from\nAnd bingo maybe you can get on science fan casting why should we scientists have all the fun the number to call is six one to\nFive six for a one three five\nYou know sometimes I'm Talking to people and they say well you know I have a question but you know it's kind of dumb kind of stupid so I don't want to get on national radio and had people laugh at me well look chances are if you have a question changes are thousands of other people have that same question\nNo matter how dumb it is somebody out there probably has been thinking about the same thing so why don't you give us a call\nAnd again the number is six one too\nSo why don't you give us a call and again the number is six one to\nFive six for aid won three five and no one question is too dumb to put on national radio\nAs I mentioned years ago there was a twenty three year old gentleman who had to go home because there was a disease affecting is University He had a lot of free time and one day he was walking down a country road\nAnd he saw an apple fall well nothing strange about that and then he looked up and he saw the moon\nAnd then he asked himself a question was changed human history\nAnd that question was if apple\nFalls does a moon also fall\nNow that's a stupid question that's a question they even a child would be embarrassed to ask the moon also fall like an apple\nWell that young gentleman said yes the moon is also falling in freefall just like the apple and then he went out to try to calculate when this ruined windfall pass the earth\nAnd then he realized that cheese the mathematics of the day we're not sufficient to calculate that so he said to him so I'm going to create a new mathematics\nThat and you've been mathematics was called calculus that man was call Isaac Newton the greatest scientist of all time and looking at a child's question of the falling moon he was able to get the law of gravity\nAnd able to work out the majesty of the universe itself\nBefore the commercial break we had a question about laser partying how do we reach the stars without a rocket ship well rocket ships for comedy you can have accidents radiation media rise and it takes for ever to reach out a space with a rocket ship why not do it on a light beam\nThat's what I call a laser party one day we would digitized the human body everything known about it you will be digitized we can put that information and the laser beam like we do the Internet shooting and outer space one second you're on the moon\nPlane minutes here on Mars in four years you're on the nearest star this is the most convenient way to conquer the universe now once you laser poured to the moon in one second you and download your laser information onto a mainframe computer\nThen the mainframe computer controls an avatar and every car which is a robot a robot that looks just like you the only difference is that it's super handsome super beautiful\nAnd it is a model and ended as super powers you become Superman and super women on the moon\nThis means you can explore the universe in an afternoon think about that one second here on the moon twenty minutes you're on Mars you can easily explore the solar system in an afternoon have breakfast in New York have lunch on Mars\nHave dinner on Venus and come back for dinner back on the planet earth\nSouth preposterous it is well within the laws of physics now let me stick my neck out let me stick my neck out now\nThink that this may already exist\nThat's right this may already be a reality perhaps alien from outer space more advanced than us have already created a highway a laser highway can stay any than containing millions of souls that are being laser part of the poor that cross the galaxy at the speed of light\nAnd then the question is are we smart enough to even know about it\nAre we smart enough even to no evidence existence and the answer is no we are so primitive so prohibited that right next to us they can be a superhighway a superhighway of aliens soldiers being laser poured across the universe\nAnd we're too stupid to know it\nBut think about that if you could leave support yourself across the solar system\nYou could journey to many asteroids many plan is just in an afternoon on each asteroid each planet and you would have superpowers\nYou wouldn't have to breathe the air you be able to lift objects that are extremely heavy and perform these like Superman because you would be problematic you would have the body of a robotic avatar but look just like you so you would never know\nThat it's not really you and then the question is is that really you well to paraphrase Bill Clinton\nIt all depends on how you define\nYou how you define you\nArgue nothing but a biological entity in which case we're talking to a tape recorder or are you the sum total of all the information known about your personality your was your dreams your desires your history your personality your friends all of that\nDigitize so the question is what are you if you can be digitized it means you can live forever\nAre you if you can be digitized it means you can live forever you can travel the universe by laser beams at the speed of light and how long would it take for your point of view it would be an instant\nYou simply get onto a laser beam and immediately you wake up on the moon you wake up on a distant star you wake up in another galaxy all of that complements the laws of physics\nOkay let's move on down to the next listener phone call\nAnd stretch ... calling from Tempe, Arizona and I have three questions are the first one is\nUm people say you can't um with untangle particles you can't Tom ... pain because she transfer and the I'm likely to it is that well then you have to tell someone you're better\nAnd that information as to why water is on the people in a great time maybe by a heartbeat write wishes happy and every second or something that I can upon who is going to be looked that\nThen you wouldn't have to transfer that information could you be able to one in look on the other end did and transformation fashion and the state line\nThat's my first question um in other words the timing they bring ... might get around having to turn that information [noise] Sally [noise]\nUm I Know this might be a potential um alternative to string theory I don't know if you actually answer this but um have you looked at the hearing was the quaint return an exceptional theory of everything and if you have I was just curious if you have any thoughts on it I'm I I think it's\nQuite interesting but um who said nowhere near us down enough to be mainstream among others might be a question and thank you very much for your right here\nI don't know listening to it and I'll be listening for long into the future [noise]\nOkay well let me take a crack in semi hearing questions are first of all we get a lot of questions about entanglements and let me explain how that works [noise]\nFirst of all it was Einstein himself in Nineteen thirty five who published a paper trying to destroy the quantum theory so Weinstein said let's take for example a two particles of light to follow ties to electrons to anything\nAnd puts it very close together so they vibrate in unison so we have two waves describing two particles vibrating together in unison then separate them according to quantum mechanics and in ... record and invisible ... emerges connecting the two\nSuch that issued juggle one electron than the other electron senses that instantly faster than the speed of light in fact you can separate the two electrons by a galaxy\nSo that at one point of the galaxy you juggle it and the other lecture and on the other side of the galaxy instantly senses it so a hot said Einstein this violates relativity and therefore is wrong\nSo Weinstein relish the idea that they eat the our experiment Einstein but all ski Rosen experiment destroyed the quantum theory\nBecause information was traveling faster than the speed of light and Einstein said nothing can go faster than the speed of light well sorry about that Albert this experiment has been done and it turns out Einstein was wrong sorry about that there really is something which goes faster than the speed of light\nBut you know Einstein has the last laugh\nThat's right mind science still has the last laugh wherever he is he's grinning some place\nBecause you can calculate the rate at which this information is traveling and even though he is innocent pain yes the information is useless it is useless random information\nYou cannot stand Morse code you cannot stand a television program\nYou cannot send the Internet on this device so Star Trek fans of course would love to have a device that allows you to contact federation headquarters at the speed of light\nAnd they think that maybe maybe entanglement will do it all on Star Trek they talk about some space subspecies communicate is allow Captain Kirk to talk to your lactic headquarters at the speed of light instantly faster than the speed of light\nWell sorry about that it turns out that\nTank quantum entanglement or does not work faster than the speed of light for usable information now here's an example let's say you have a Red Sox and a green sock and you put one sock on red and the other side is going to be green you got that\nOne leg you put a Red Sox and the other is occupied a green or vice versa let's say one day one day a friend of yours does is putting on socks and you lift up one pass lake is green\n[noise] now what is the color of the others sock on the other leg well obviously has read any idiot no is that right now the question is\nHow fast it you know that once you do that when soccer's green how fast it you know there's the other side was there at well instantaneous\nI Would say aha this dish travel instantaneously faster than the speed of light but it is useless random useless information so sorry about that\nYou cannot go faster than the speed of light with information Feinstein has the last laugh [noise] okay let's take a short commercial break once again the number to call is six when to buy

S.\nBasically means that you take an education and the training to work with seniors at different ages and nobody wants to be called older except for like the four year old or wishes he was five years but the designation kind of ones from baby boomers and even a little bit earlier people who were just thinking about things like downsizing\nAll the way up to folks who are almost a hundred years old there's a lot more planning family conference saying things like that that go on them when the typical sale and there's a big need because sometimes people are taking advantage of\nI see no according to its very definition the seniors real estate specialist designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older\nWith all their real estate needs as you said so one of those needs may well be investing in real estate in your later years so tell me is that a smart idea or is that something you're better off starting\nIn your twenties thirties and forties\nOpinion is is better off starting it early because that's been real estate basically asked for different areas of possible game the first is appreciation on a property obviously rises in price over time as area around it does as well second profit center\nYeah obviously rises in price over time as area around it does as well\nSecond profit center is at the tenant increases your equity by essentially helping you pay your mortgage down three is cash low rent better figure that out slow and depreciation\nSo in order to put all for those two words you really want to get started early ... to be a first time their desks or in real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps look at things like reach real estate investment trust that you can basically purchase through an investment advisor more like a a security than a real estate purchase itself\nYou know and that makes it a lot of sense because after all a real estate investment trust is more like buying stock and you're not a landlord and you don't have vacancies you don't have to qualify for a mortgage it can make a lot of sense no matter what your age is\nAbsolutely it's kind of one of those things that if you believe that real estate\nBoth appreciation generates cash flow\nWhich it has historically done that's a great way not to be the only one on the hook you know being an individual owner of real estate is is kind of a you know you're the person in a ... year spread out with hundreds of other people buying larger blocks of the best but property and professional property management\nI see so that's good advice if you are already an older person it might not be the best move to start real estate investing at your age but for all those people who might be a little bit younger than that it can reap great benefits in the years ahead\nAbsolutely interesting fact the last forty years appreciation and least January as average about three percent per year coincidentally or maybe not the wage growth in our area three percent a year\n... so if you believe that our economy is strong enough to keep wage growth and employment on track\nThere is no reason that real estate pricing at least closer in shouldn't keep pace with wage increases\nPeter we still have so much more to talk about and I'd like to really drill in on your four ways real estate can generate income can you joined us again and the next hour of real estate today\nAbsolutely more than happy to join you\nThank you Peter Peter Crouch real tour and associate broker with macaroni associates incorporated in Alexandria, Virginia [noise]\nComing up on real estate today when you sell a property have you ever thought about holding the note that strategy and much more straight ahead on our special show retiring wealth [noise]\nDo you love listening to act that real estate join the conversation\nA police officer is shot and killed I'm an Carrick Fox News it happened in ...

your senior years\nRight now we're going to continue our conversation with an expert\nA person who actually teaches real estate investing to people all around the United states [noise]\nJoining us again now is Peter ... real tour with bishop\nWest real estate license to Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida he's been a real tour for Thirty years and he carries many of NPR's advanced certifications including the certified commercial investment member designation Peter thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's my pleasure to be back thank you for having me\nWell Peter I appreciate you coming back when we left you in our first our we had just finished talking about a tried and true real estate investment strategy in which you buy another house but you keep the one you're in and rent it out that seems like a great way to start\nEspecially if it is a rental market for example where we are in Florida right now there's a terrific went to the\n... ... ... air being being what it was so wrong yeah top dollar by renting out of the Arab be India's a weekly or monthly quite go on as a annual rental mhm\nBut an annual rental is slow and steady slow and steady when the race\n[laughter] that's always going to either\nSo Peter if someone's leaning forward and listening to this and they're fascinated by it how would you advise that they find a good property that will continue to generate a good amount of rent\nThe first thing that you need is a good realtor that knows the market\nAnd not somebody that you know from the gym or the country club that's nice to you a realtor that specializes in investment property and understand somebody that's willing to sit\nDown and the course and explained the pros and cons some states that if you're a residential rental property than others need to look at regulation\nAnd what the landlord business as ... but the next biggest critical piece of advice is when you dig into real estate for investment leather residential vacation rental office retail\nIndustrial you\nKnow what you're doing what I mean by that is unique to know the landlord tenant laws in that state is how it pertains\nYou understand that part of the business of rentals you will be on top of your game already Seventy five percent\nOf the successes understanding the rules\nThat is such great advice\nAnd you know we already mentioned buying a new house and keeping the when you already have but if you want to stay in your house and you're not going to move how would you recommend one of our listeners pays for property they fine\nWell you know you if you have equity in your adult refinanced your home and take equity or you get a bridge loan between the two properties mhm there are a lot of private investors out\nOr is that what they call hard money\nYeah absolutely could be called hard money private equity investors but what a lot of folks can do you can't buy yourself that you can fast is if you have a\nIRA you can take it to be a self directed IRA some banks do it some national come next to it and you invest the money you direct where it goes so for example somebody looking\nFor money for a down payment on the alert to finance the flip property or to get into something\nNeeds fifty Seventy five a hundred thousand a good source of self directed IRAs because that person is going to get more in real estate investment based on interest in return than they would if they were to um just have it with a institutional higher rate company\nIt's paying probably two percent today stock markets good maybe it's three percent\nYou know Peter back is fascinating\nAnd let me ask you another question about all this you know you have\nMore than one hundred properties it'd be combined Florida in Massachusetts\nDid you just kind of end up there\nAnd by Florida in Massachusetts did you just kind of end up there or was that part of your plan to have one hundred one properties by this time in your life\nThat was kind of planned out the Massachusetts is where my home and I raised my son as it turned out that it wasn't a planned Venice, Florida is the right\nSpot has a lot of desire ability and therefore a gift of based on the Gulf Coast rack and go up and down and do what I Need to do so that was definitely in the plan that\nIs wonderful one more question for you my friend tell our listeners if you will\nThat if they retire and they have anywhere from a handful of properties to a whole lot of properties what will their life be like\nI wouldn't know what we're from it is and that's and that's a nervous worked for bank but I can assure you that it will be able to live the lifestyle that you're looking at a live without worrying about it is you're controlling your own destiny\nHeater that is just such great perspective and thank you for all the insights and the advice wonderful job my friend and I really appreciate you being on the show\nThank you it's my pleasure you're very welcome Peter West real turn

military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily\nAnd together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil\nIs here for hours one and two\nHours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes\nBecause there's absolutely nothing going on right [laughter] I actually remember slow new gate news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days\nWhen was the last time we had a slow news day open lines in the last half hour of this audio transmission of course there's the murder of Saudi journalist ... there are migrants on the march from Honduras there as the mid term elections in on the horizon we could talk about all that stuff\nBut but\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ... and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nAs you know really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that um they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal\nAnd of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems\nThat really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a\nDefense system weapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate\nA the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion\nHand cost the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now because everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together in Helsinki this July\nUh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nUh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic heat\nAh the United states I I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower\nUh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like well he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it but at the same time he doesn't want stability he does want in the tensions uh but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nLet's pivot to China you mentioned the trade wars [laughter] uh ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if\nI Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later in this in the camps to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ... you know there are what six and a half percent growth\nIn the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property in in\nTrump's says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to Chinese you know not only cyber attacks but through\nYour company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that you know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go\nTo China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants to a fair playing field arguably president and chief said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement and the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and it just like the ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree gassing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nAnd it's a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps an ... in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nA bed may is is driven by ideology in any way are are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedge them any\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nI'm voting for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint or the west is what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that\nIn fact you know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he ... he still is perceived\nWidely as a leader of the common man\nIn the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but [noise]\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to\nYou know hint at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh ... this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard\nAnd there's a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interest\nIn fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese prime leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met you know for taking time over\nThe top sites and the interruption I got to jump in here will pick up on the other side of the lines of evil lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis years Jimi Hendrix taking us into the break with who do child on the coast to coast and [noise]\nI think it's kind of neat I met her getting out just down the mail or credit card again use your seat identity to stay safe here and download my thoughts and get more than your free [noise]\n\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived who do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard it's Russia a given their provocations but also a their military capability or which they're not shy to exercise around the globe I'm very you know the chief of naval operations animal rich and\nYou know have said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place I ... in nuclear submarine and\nAnd I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the Atlantic but Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course they're confronting us\nMilitarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as\nWe know all about the allegations and\nIn justifiably are the sanctions put in place because with their interference in the twenties sixteen election\nAnd here recently or in the\nTwenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested a someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not\nA you know backing down and that I gave him if there's you know some given some take but maybe a it's not a favoring\nAn outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you join up with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous or China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic or weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind\nYou know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is why the U.S Congress or in the\nNational defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there\nI I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO or and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat of the long term threat and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nAh twenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and\nArguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the\nAh the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry a and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capability\nAnd of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony in border we want to go to war maybe World War three or ...\nWell that that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia go in and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one\nOf the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the like and we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's capability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need\nThat may not have the wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so uh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in primaries next week you know certainly\nYou know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts in NATO and and he was saying look you\nFolks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat\nPosed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a\nYou know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine\nThese are all issues of great uh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out our NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been\nHearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president is accused the Chinese of of meddling in the mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that ...\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know it'd be a defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese maids yeah phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are ... you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect or that the Chinese have and somehow you know put chips in these devices that can turn on\nAnd trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals it's impacting the institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nUh activities building equipment that through\nSecond and third level a contributors to a a large end item end up in the U.S military and that's why I think that a lot of people were concerned you know\nWould you wonder why we're so committed to the community remember we're the only locally owned\nMedia and be CEOs and we didn't get manners WG a W College Station Bryan\nHope and look into brands of search I'm your host mark Edwards residents arches a weekly radio magazine program that covers the artistic and cultural events taking place in and around the brands of Sally be sure to tune in Nebraska starts each week to find out what's happening in our area theaters museums galleries music venues and more\nOn this edition of brands and starts it's time for lanterns and legends presented by the episode of theater alliance mother Sanderson will be in Studio to talk about never saw the history wrapped in a cemetery tour beginning October twenty ...\nWe'll talk with artist Chelsea brought about her exhibit called natural infused with the backlog gallery and bring them into her appearance at the Texas arts and music festival\nPrivacy angel stops by with details of the century singers in Texas and in women's chorus fall concert on October twenty first and Stephanie McCartney assuming they will be here with info about the chemistry open house on October twenty seventh on the campus of Texas and you say to to learn more on this edition of Raza starts\nWell two things that are pretty much guaranteed here in Nebraska smelly when October rolls around our will make it three I guess rain cooler temperatures and lanterns in ledger invent the never sort of theater reliance on an episode and modest Anderson is here to tell us all about this year's event mama spoken rather starts thank you very much\nThis has been going on for a long time and I know this year you're going out into\nThe Oakland cemetery on sixth street so basically you're turning actors into do since for a cemetery\nOh well you know okay I actually have tour guides to lead the audience around the actors are pretty much planted at their gravesite of their ancestors\nOkay and I was gonna say for trade ... when you plant some of the great site that may ... connotation we don't want to go to what there'll be hanging out there\nTelling stories about the people whose race I certainly to be at absolute only talking about the details are this is actually coming up on October the twenty eighth ... versions or the outdoor versions ... or the twenty fifth and twenty six twenty seventh of October ... cemetery so tell us what to expect when they get their wealth\nHow this is our six year to do this so we hope that we know what we're doing with this ah [laughter] the uh audience should plan to spend about an hour on each to or they arrive check in at the ticket table and\nSpend about an hour on each to her they arrive check in at the ticket table and are assigned a tour guide the tourist begin every Fifteen minutes low the tour itself\nIs is a walking tour and um we'll take ... around an hour and a so people should please be sure and we're comfortable sturdy walking shoes right\nAnd be prepared to pause and listen and it's perfectly fine in fact we suggest bringing your own flashlight also the tour guide carries a battery powered lantern and a flashlight and there will be some\nSolar powered lighting at the grave sites that we visit but of course this is a cemetery reading it doesn't have\nNaturally led not at All right now the question you mentioned ticket tables that going to be in front of the theater or actually in front of the cemetery no it's\nIt's at the cemetery ... we really recommend that people make their ticket reservations ahead of time through the theater by telephone by leaving a message on an answering machine because we're a community theater right into a small staff that do not have somebody they're answering the phone all the time\nTo be lovely to have that though which when\nThat thing that we make do with what we have true or leave a message if you know exactly what day in what time you want tickets for that'll save getting a call back and trying to track that down but otherwise people can go on line to the now the soda theater website\nAnd uh go to Leonard legends dropped down menu and make their own ticket reservations\nAnd the specific show those two things are the website ... theater that's T. H. E. H. E. R. E. dot org or you can give them a call at nine three six eight to five three one Ninety five to reserve your spots and you're starting these things in about six thirty PM Thursday Friday and Saturday evening for the outside tours correct\nRight the six thirty one is sort of a twilight tour unless we have a lot of overcast though we're coming down to the the shortest day of the year it gets dark earlier all the time but the the six thirty when you could still kind of see what's going on after about seven o'clock it's dark really you really just have to trust the tour guide\nNow for folks who are interested in taking the outdoor versions you're doing an indoor version of this as well on the twenty eighth at the theater to preempt a red light correct now that'll work how are we putting everybody on stage or we scared of them are up a theater ...\nThe theaters home theater and it's a transfer stage and they're they're ceding on both sides of it right for the Atlanta Legends indoors we just use CD on one side so that we have the whole stage for setting up as near a simulation as we can shirts to give people the taste of what\nThe experiences like minus the walking and the bugs [laughter] like that\nWe actually designed this with some of our older supporters in mind because some of the people who are most enthusiastic about it and that was sort of history and all are people who are getting on a year or maybe the least mobile right and and we really worry about having folks that are are a little bit\nThere isn't impaired or mobility impaired walking around in the cemetery in the dark\nThat is why his thinking on your parts but folks who want the full experience should check out the evening I mean ... and I haven't been because I'm a coward okay I'm not going to a cemetery after dark but for those who are brave enough I've spoken to some who have gone in recent years and they say it is awesome you learn some stuff you didn't know it's really cool walking out with a group in a\nFrom lighted areas to dark areas to lighted areas in the in the cemetery and the history you're going to learn is not made up stuff it's real historical stuff above the residents\nAs accurate as we can make it and still have it um entertaining and engaging for people but we we put people at the at actual grave sites for those that they're portraying and we tell their stories the best that we can research them\nAnd we have a very loyal following actually oh yeah excited when we have people say oh I've come every year\nAnd in fact for those people we begin to put in a few little asides like as we're walking down this path you may remember where we visited with so and so it went over there as you know and so it's a it really becomes a a kind of a a story with some continuity to it\nWill feedback for this over the years as I mentioned it's been about Ninety nine point nine percent positive you know occasionally gets a little cool came every now and I guess ... generally dress for the for the conditions are going outside and other details for this location wise are\nThursday through Saturday can starting at six thirty feet on the open cemetery is located at eight o one sixth street and have a soda for you folks have a GPS and of course the indoor session is at two o'clock on the twenty eight that the sunny for him in theater that's one of four west Washington all in Napa so to Texas brought you folks by an episode of theater alliance and\nWe think are cooperating of sponsors partners whatever the both the city of never soda and the ... valley uh arts council and I'm a a local sponsor or two\nOver there you go ... has been I guess from that episode of the airlines Mahvish thanks very much well thank\nYou for having me\n\n\n\nChelsea rock is the Dallas area based artist specializing in mixed media and photography and artist high Chelsea woken debris as a starts\nRight I hear\nYou I certainly know what photography is but since I Am not an artist myself explained to me what mixed media is in your particular case\nHe'll and my particular case I build on my character as he was like a traditional threats Candace but back then what what is it a hard surface to work on Iran or Iraq I'll hope\nSomething what I like to say interesting abstract you know colors and kind of players and not for texture\nAnd wrote an eye on corporate plant like organic plants and in fact a lot of times butterfly grown ... flowers and different things and they're an interesting way out on top of that fearful and then I feel every fall actually part rather than\nFor that helps the one clear right down in her third every ... every time well come up with a therapist for next thing really nice to hang on walls [laughter]\nNow is that basically a texture thing or do you get unique colors involved in that way as well\nOkay well let's see you have had a some stuff on display and the backlog gallery and bring them you've had stuff up through September and through the end of this month\nAnd in fact this week and you're going to be at the Texas arts and music festival in Brent I'm On the twentieth or you actually going to be hanging out at your own exhibition in the backlog gallery or will you be sort of bouncing around through the entire thing\nI Will I be Africa gallery a printer and hearing a couple of ways of getting the station for highlight yet um my\nInitial however and texture laid out on pieces and them for you and with people and the gallery opening her seven so afterward I plan on going and checking out front or like when you say\nOkay so who's actually up in front waving a baton is that you are David KIPP or do you guys sort of take a little bit or\nThat just made David conducts are sent a thinker debts and on the other two choirs\nOkay wow you guys see busy and people just don't know this stuff\nSo I'm assuming there's a place probably on the corral activities website for the university where there's a schedule I'm hoping yes people want to hear you guys saying because I Know there are like the singing too that's performed before football games threat how many people you know about that no I don't not very many is going to be the answer I'll tell you right\nNow that the answer is not very many so folks if you want to hear some good singers and progress being run by some qualified folks check out the schedules and go see the darn concerts because they really really talented folks\nWell Travis ... we have started to get the ball rolling down the hill so as these things keep rolling along as in coming up on the counter I'm going to pass through you and make you come back here and tell us more about this love to already so the one coming up that we talked about is going to be on October the twenty first is that an and Methodist Church\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon if you go to corral activities office website on T. A. a new dot edu somewhere you can get tickets for seven dollars or even to show up at the door with a ten dollar bill and you get in and you can check this out and it'll be fabulous\nTravis angel has been our guest in Travis welcome for the first and definitely not the last time Oh thank you very much\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nTexas CNN's chemistry open house in science exploration advantage is coming up and it's my calculations are correct this is the thirty first one of the things that's what I found that fell right huh I Stephanie McCartney and Sunni lemar back in our studios ladies walking back to brass asserts\nThis has always such a cool event and it people say how can you do this on an art show or if you haven't been to a chemistry open house in your life on this campus\nThen you don't know but if you have been you'll get it because there's a lot of artsy cool things going on and you know what I'm going to let Stephanie assume he tell you about it because they do so much better than I Do so what's happening at this thing on October the twenty seventh from ten AM to three PM\nSo any chemistry building complex weird thing to have lots of different activities in demonstrations this year's theme is Kenny she's out of this world we're going to do a lot of cool things with space chemistry or a couple of activities in demos specifically that are we going to have an alien test to get you or maybe someone you know as an elite\nOkay you got to be a little specific now when you say an alien tests were not actually drawing blood or anything you know All right so what are we doing for an alien test or can you get that I Want to spoil it I don't want to ... oh okay All right so you got so where's that going to be physically\nThat's going to be on the second floor of the Michigan okay All right\nWe're gonna make little miniature Mars is and know how we get that red dirt on the planet and ... we're going to make rockets and they're going to fly up with Alka Seltzer so we've got a lot of really cool stuff and that's not all that not all lawyers that are not all where I was going to have a lot of our usual favorites are making polymer sneeze\nOn playing with Ninety Tony influence so it's like let's say if you hit it hard enough it feels like a solid\nSee it's so funny when you say non Newtonian fluids as if that's just common\nSo everybody who knows what not Newtonian fluid is raise your hand my and saying down to what is it not new toney wood for heaven's sakes\nIs it fluid that it can have liquid like and how they're like properties depends on the hotter\nOkay oh so it's pressure not temperature yeah okay well that actually sounds kinda cool then All right what else come on keep going dish\nWhere I was going to make sign because everyone loves signed up through and there's so much more we're going to have all of our groups from the chemistry department graduate student groups undergraduate groups were also going to have people from physics come over and do some stuff people from different departments and he he is science is a college and people from engineering it's not\nYeah and it's always interesting when you write the engineers over because they have to show off a little bit so I'm always intrigued to see what they bring to the table um we mentioned this is tend to three on a Saturday the twenty seventh of October did not mention that is absolutely free the citizen it on ...\nSo sue me how did you get roped into this and tell me your responsibilities are as far as this thing's concern\nYet we also have a tendency to do this show right now the famous ... every year we have for shows nine thirty eleven AM type study and two PM and kicking them very limited as they got to come at least Fifteen minutes earlier than to show\nAnd these will be in the chemistry building independence day breathing during one hundred and ... and when you say tickets they this is just a matter of getting a head count right yes for safety\nOkay [laughter]\nOh boy chemist talking about safety so we're not we're not just going to touch it might just sodium out into\nThe air or anything like that rather do something else\nAnd just sodium out into the air or anything like that revenue something else\nIn the audience would be safe okay\nBut you're not ... for the cameras up in front of the room okay\nWell we have poetry contest and it was it it said do you buy this Friday oh okay so you have children from kindergarten to high school but you're right the ... space and then made it to us\nOkay and if a male to they need to send it to send to\nKennedy department picks up saying All right that you know\nAnd I bet if you go to the tea AMU dot edu website you'll find an actual address for the chemistry department yeah the mail that thing too but you have to do that posts are actually since this is very Thursday now you have to drive over or won't get airing die\nSo that folks can certainly go out and check out the other poets now what are you basing that poetry on is this just the the quality the poetry or how much cool scientific information we're going to have in this are\nBoth of them scientific information and this art creativity\nAnd just to follow the topic the whole thing I Want to remind you that ... the chemistry is out of this award write something about the war the space\nOkay uh now I see what you're going to have it says on your little sort of promotional she here I'm reading and I'm quoting fascinating lectures by Texas A M chemistry faculty how many folks are we talking about and what are they\nTalking about maybe one or not\nKept pace of yesterday's faith and say okay and that's something else are we talking about\nChemistry things that are being done like on the space station or by asking us when they're out in space you say space chemistry I'm a little unclear itch give me a wild guess what that might be about\nHow can be about a large range of things okay what's happening in space in general so yes doing different experiments on the international space station that could also mean how the planets were developed what each of the atmosphere is a different planet so we have in our solar system are comprised of um how the sun\nWorks yeah it was the\nAir pollution how the order layer it was it the demolished by chemical compounds ... and then your stories\nEnhance Arnie for ESPN fifty or better said the old TV weatherman but anyway the important part of this is the fact that the chemistry open house is really a lot of fun and it sounds a little nerdy but you

lead to reach their generation\nAnd there's a Sarah growth song and this is going to totally date and me because I'm pretty sure that she came out with it\nAll the time that you guys were toddling around and it's a song called the tent in the center of town and it's all about an event it's all about basically a crusade that comes to town and in the chorus that says there's a tent in the center of town\nWhere the people can gather around\nWho wouldn't step foot in a church but who weren't afraid of the good news crusade\nThen\nGood news they then and\nNow with your events are you noticing that some of these students that calm probably wouldn't set foot in a church\nFor sure it's amazing what has been taking place off and\nA lot of the people that attend a these out a life events that have taken place some of them are Christian young people that are have grown up and churches and things and\nBut often a lot of those Christian young people are not necessarily in the best place themselves and they really need to be impacted by the gospel and by Jesus or again and then others are other people or many stories of people that are not connect to a church that at all that might not go to church on a on a weekly basis or much at all\nThat come because a friend invited them and often or what's exciting is that through an event that's led by teenagers when a when a Christian teenager invites their friend or something like this and says hey would you be willing to come here me speaking and share this completely teenage let a bed\nOr some of these people that it and say wow that's incredible I thought that church was just something for adults or something that happens or a church is they come and they hear their friends and say well I I never knew that this was about a personal relationship with Jesus and that\nThis is what we need to focus on so it's incredible what takes place throughout our life has been through a movement of young people rich and young people\nCare so I'm thinking about this and I am fascinated to just see the student led event but as an adult and I'm speaking for probably several many adults that it's kind of scary to hand the gospel over to a student\nAnd hand that over and say okay now just go forth and share with these other students what is your grid for allowing students to speak on a platform on the stage to other students\nA great question the good news is that there are some teenagers and young people out there is definitely a minority but others minority there's a strong percentage and a strong I'm Out of teenagers that do love Jesus\nIs minority there's a strong percentage and a strong them out of teenagers they do love Jesus but I've grown up\nIn churches they're grown up with good Christian parents families often I stayed at anybody that there's a strong leader for Jews are so we find that either had really really good parents who are really really good churches or a combination of both\nThat have been investing and pouring into their lives there are some good people out there good teenagers to do no Jews as they are strong view logically they understand the gospel and we'll coach and train them and how to share the gospel clearly through in a bed through things like that\nNow Jordan your grandfather is run hedge graft and for some of our listeners they're familiar with him as being an evangelist and an author and speaker and radio show host do you feel like you're walking in his footsteps\nOr maybe a little bit I it's been so amazing to have a such a a exciting and influential a grandfather and Ron raptors just port so much into my life he's been a\nHuge mentor and voice in my life as I've grown up over the years and he's very much influenced by our family to

really grown up in in my family a DNA literally and figuratively it's very exciting what God has been doing through this\nNow Emma you along with working with Jordan and how to life movement you also

first point an accusatory finger and Saudi ruler\nThat alternative explanation is road opportune took it upon themselves to carry out the murder of her show me by mid week the world still lack a plausible answer turned the middle east expert David ... New York times\nAnd a personal acquaintance of ...\nWhat was your relationship with your mom could show you\nWhere are you with us shores you know he was somebody I was friendly with them is that we would have lunch together and chit chat you know somewhat I Would have over to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew it we all knew he was he was our guy not\nTo like what do you see happening David\nWhere the mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services\nUh the jerky boys likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that show he had been killed inside the confidence in Istanbul\nAnd that seems like the way things are headed at this hour a well informed shores who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia at identified the person they're going to say is responsible\nHe put it more efficiently and said the person that is responsible someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince vomit\nThat is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person until it just\nHad the authorization to carry out some kind of a rendition and that went horribly wrong if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that has seemed terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia or for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nThis is the Henry the second defense from when the English King\nSaid ... will no one read me a bit troublesome praised informants lights go off in ... can America the drill it works in the drama in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think\nWell what does works main you know for whatever mentoring governments make do with a partial troops fairly often uh the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish ah the officials and all this been confirmed\nIt's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair\nHis ... his reputation you know he gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up the kingdom kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover rendition on bad import cage NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do think the royal court changes in succession\nAre just two elements that first of all I think this person is a intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person is try that person will be tried in Saudi cord\nSo that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the crown prince or you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession\nSpeaking with her country guy mentioned his recent book into the hands of soldiers and then he'd been in the middle east correspondent for the New York times since you've well qualified to unravel the mysterious geopolitics of the region or conversation continues\nSaturday and it has changed crown prince ... consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key levers and so the best handicapping is there's no one in a position to challenge him a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over this he's made many enemies along the way\nNone of them seems to have enough left to push him out a lot of succession as long as their dad is okay with it and his dad is elderly and may not be that company right now [laughter]\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king I'm not too long ago and she expected me with NBS when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that there is within the guy and this was just a range of ... second option which is your ... responsibility but not a guilt\nThe other one is you say someone was trying to take me out rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the royals and I had improved and the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know and to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that is what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative is someone who actually was a friend\nOf a crowd Brits around but Solomon who felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nWill that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the ... the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would a Henry the second offends me six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared\nIts intelligence Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe a video of from inside the conflict showing who did what and the access in Asia you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence ... who often work very closely with the Turks\nThen that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree\nOf seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nAll right now and does it impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually where I come home this is the anti Iran alliance being ...\nUh Jordan and Egypt in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America trying to confront these were sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome as being a necessary course correction the middle east\nUh I'm not sure this had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish than is whatsoever about what's been done here and so far it looks like President Trump is\nVery willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday you know getting out of the Saudis had already\nSuggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis have begin to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm Jim ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long David Kirkpatrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion you know the wall street and Silicon Valley\nOr he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they're no out to help diversify the Saudi economy he's gonna find it very hard to be a front man for that\nSort of effort and that's not

they do how they can help us live healthier happier more fit live but today we're going to start off with someone that's near and dear to my heart his name is David Guest\nHe is the owner of home and said senior care he's been my friend for years I worked for him I'm On cable time back in the day\nI'm working with TV ads and and communications I consider him a friend and I do business with him now but he went through something that I felt like he needed to share with everyone and there's lessons to be learned I Hope you take advantage of this great interview take some notes and hopefully you'll think about\nYour friends and family members that are in the hospital a little differently here at first on today's show is David Guest become instead senior care\nAt first on today's show is David Guest instead senior care\nLet's begin with David gas at home instead senior care and David it's nice to see is today because\nA lot thing going on that I didn't know about launching Branstad to speak as we hear you on the radio all the time that's happened to you and what new perspective do you have on what you do now\nWell I guess what happened to me I should have seen coming\nAnd uh and I didn't and uh\nI don't think we can see our health ...\n... you know some things sneak up on you are in retrospect I shouldn't be expected it I I think\nIn in in terms of what happened to me um I used to have this frame of mind that said it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when and when it happened at the end of July and I had a quadruple bypass surgery and I'm\nAn active guy you're coughing anyway care fit\nOn this kick you by surprise and physicians didn't really accurately diagnose you for a while well\nI don't know that they didn't accurately diagnose me ah you you know my wife Linda told me will I don't know if you're doing a good job of describing your symptoms I thought I was but listen I I Can't question the judgment of physicians\nI mean they deal with things like this every day for me it was hopefully a once in a lifetime experience right although I've heard of people having bypass surgery\nMore than one you don't want to go through that more oh I'd I'd I'd I'd prefer not okay [laughter] so now when we get our news found information of being in the hospital\nOnline ready to San Diego are they not every condition gets shared overnight no and so they can and cannot be chairman instead of go on for her\nKnow their their their medical conditions that can prevent a person from\nBeing able to emulate and in and let's not even think about um\nThe the tasks that you need to do in everyday life whether that's getting to the doctor getting your prescriptions filled you know something that we talked to physicians about all the time it's clear you have a problem with people who missed their appointments because when I have an appointment\nYou call me you email me you text me you make it very clear that you're expecting me at ten o'clock\nOn Tuesday so it tells me that there are a lot of people who don't go to their appointments I think in many cases it's because they can't go to their appointments\nSomeone in terms of getting there yeah\nAnd so what happens is they miss the appointment\nBase stay on the same medication regimen and and maybe the doctor would have changed it\n[noise]\nThey don't often take care of their their dietary needs\nThat doctor's appointment may very well have said you know Mr Jones your blood pressure is still up I Want to make sure you are on the low sodium diet [noise]\nI mean for the lack of a meal\nEverything was lost

doctors home health hospice home care like we provide there were a lot of stakeholders in there but the central point and all of that is the patient\nIs the people that are listening to your show

the\nThings that we endeavor to do I mean we have a\nPerson who builds relationships with all the health care providers in the community he he does marketing and relationship building for us\nAnd um it's a it's a it's a very educational process you know when we go to\nA home health agencies for example\nAnd and we specialize in dealing with seniors\nWe will ask this question very frequently ... you know some of the other home health agencies that we work with have told us\nThat their patients hate to see them go\nAt the nurse comes in checks their vitals does their meds and may be there for thirty minutes may be there for an hour does a wonderful job\nBut she has to go back home healthy their interests are gonna see perhaps eight or ten people a day mhm\n[noise] one of the things that seniors suffer from isolation\nThey need that companionship they need someone to talk to and so we asked comb health agencies has that\nBeen your experience and invariably they say oh yeah it's a big problem\nIn one of the reasons we exists\nIt is and say you provide a lot of different\nSurveys on as long\nAs they're needed and you can go back and start up and start ... got back in June and change it depends on a person's health and it depends on what they need and sometimes they just want people to say about them\nYou know we've had a lot of folks that we took care of mom mom passed\nWe took care of her dad's dad passed and we do care dad's brother\nI think that's a good testament to what we do the fact that we've worked with multiple members of the same family\nUm but\nWhat makes it even worse Debbie is when you discharge a patient who has dementia\n\nIf you live alone and you have even early stage ... let's say\nYou can't function you're going to struggle yeah you know we've gone into the homes of people with dementia\nAnd they go I don't remember if I took today's Madison or not and we look at the pill box and we see that they not only took today's but they took tomorrow [noise] people like that need assistance in their homes\nI Know a lot of family members if he can't the question of money yeah yeah can can mom or dad afford to have someone come in and see that well sometimes they can they can't afford not to because do you really want that person by themselves eight to ten hours a day while you're working in that safe for you is it safe for them\nIt's a conundrum um our services primarily private pay\nA long term here we do take long term care insurance and more and more of the clients we serve are indicating to us I have long term care is it's going to pay for it yes it will be a big smile and even even in the heart of it is helpful it is um and different policies call for different amounts of\nPayments right in a lifetime limit on it I mean you know those kinds of data and insurance and I and\nI'm every policies different I'm ... and it breaks are hard sometimes when we go in and we see that they don't have the funds to pay for the amount of care they need\nOf times there's this like gap that's missing for people that are actually active and doing things that\nThey don't necessarily know where to go for something like that they may know like oh I don't necessarily need to see a doctor but might plan or fascist been bothering me for a long time that a lot [laughter] okay uh and so we just kind of get used to it and that's what this is kind of trying to fill that gap it so that people have a place to go that they can get evaluated\nReferred to a physician if they need to be referred or you know starting a treatment plan to actually\nGet over it okay are are we too old to be doing what we're doing are we out of shape and that's what we're hurting ourselves or do we just not know how to exercise right no I don't think it's\nReally any of that I think that sometimes we just get injured I mean I'm guilty of it too I ignore some of my own injuries it's just easier\nOK okay let's take if you don't want to but I think that the reason this is a great\nPlace is that it actually led to live the lifestyle you want just because you're older it doesn't mean that you don't want to be active I mean I plan on being active the rest of my life um and so we want to make sure that people\nAre able to do what they want to do now what\nDo you do for us when we come up here and we see you and we say we we hurt we've got this pain or or ... or\nA leg it was injured and\nWhat what types of things do you do to help\nSo sometimes I'll get referrals him PT offices are\nYou know doctors downstairs or whoever or just here say throughout the community so depending on where you come from you know we'll do an injury violation see what's going on and see what can actually be coughing you're paying becomes a lot of the time we treat the pain and not the problem that's causing it so we want to make sure we do both so\nYou know we base our appointments off his time because we don't want you to just schedule for cutting session because\nI'm a evaluate you and say well you know what we need to just you and do some other things so\nIt's kind of case by case dependent and then just trying to figure out the best treatment plant and it's going to work for that person and that injury and what they're trying to do okay\nYou've got a great big machine and that often that's an intimidating machine what what is that machine and what is it do to help you do your job there\nSo that excess skin actually as part of\nExes um individuals and we have exercise to geologist out working core and so the ... the most accurate form of body composition so for us it's nice because\nYou know when you're doing a workout plan sometimes the number on the scale doesn't change but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not losing weight or becoming more fit so it actually measures lean mass and fat and sometimes you're\nLosing fat massing gaining lean mass and that's why you don't see that change but it gives you a really solid piece of information that can say well yeah the number might be similar but you've lost five pounds of fat massing games they found them lean mass so that's actually\nWhat you want to write one of the physicians tossing here Dr marsh about our diet\nDiet seems to be a big problem and she said that we need to eat more natural foods stay away from the processed foods is that one of the things that can get us off track as just our eating habits or along with exercise a juicy\nAnd Dr marsh is great to work with with that and she manages most of all of that kind of stuff and she's even helped me I've had um it's yeah it's and\nI've been helpful so it's kinda like you need every section of the business to take a look at you to see where we want to go 'cause we all have our goals\nYeah it's nice because core really compliments a lot of people and sometimes you know Dr Marshall have a patient that with an effect on something I Do or vice versa and so we see a lot of people once they come in they really take advantage of some of our other services um just because\nThey really do go well together with what we're trying to achieve so you're really trying to be you know overall improve your total wellness you know there's a lot of things that core that can help you do\nOkay tell me what is an athletic trainer do 'em so athletic trainers can do a lot of things um I think most often or associated with the person on his island with a lot bottle but there's much more that goes into our jobs and that\nWe're able to get certified in all kinds of different things like after releasing some of the things I mentioned earlier like the ... and now one of helping and driving they said they're all forms of basically\nSoft tissue recovery system will help a street the fashion um which ones are the top of your muscle on different areas of tightness or trigger points you know everyone has one and they're trapped ran right there's ways to actually treat those you don't just have to live with them we can help you get rid of that kind of stuff\nAnd and you know they all do something a little bit different but that's why it's nice because trainers can have such a diverse background\nAnd have had so many different experiences along the way that will be able to pull a lot of different uh you know told from October to be able to\nTreat you I've heard a lot about Dr ... is that hurt can depend on what what type of conditions be dry needle and you can join needle for a lot of things we can even dropped nearly ... ... now what does that do if you joined needle or\nYou can do it for you know AT T empty pain um there's a lot of different things that you can do it for I don't typically do a ton of that up here in mostly we're I'm helping people in tonight at their sugar points out a lot of IT ban tightened if it's a pretty good way to get rid of that now know\nWhy would our IT been ... ... people that don't know if that's a muscle that runs down the ... what is the reasoning for that and getting so tight because I think every that happens to everybody\nYeah a lot of people it's from overused but it's not a very fun place to summer also asked people just kinda neglect that spot and so then it goes down into your knee and that's usually when people are like okay this is really bothering me now I Need to do something about it\nSo we try to kinda catch that ahead of time and it can also influenced some other things that could be tight like your ...\nUm so okay a lot of this is not being stretched out beforehand or not have enough water or just wear and tear it can kind of\nBe all of those things and it just depends on the person to what they're doing because you cannot potato ... band and not even work out or you can be a ... to topple and so you know there's a lot of\nDifferent reasons that those things can happen and you can treat them the same way or some differences just based off that person okay how do we get an appointment with you and how far do you see people how often do you have to you\nIt's kind of dependent on the patient and I have some people that come twice a week or once a week other people that aren't really necessarily having pain anymore but they like to do maintenance treatment so they'll schedule every now and again after they do something and\nDo maintenance treatment so they'll schedule every now and again after they do something and you know just when it gets himself to she worked on for us it's just you don't need a referral from a physician\nWhich is nice and because there's no limit to how often or how little you can come and so you know have to do is call her office and schedule and athletic recovery session and will\nGive us a phone number for that\nIt's nine seven nine or ... five

couple three years ago and in Phoenix a couple of times I've I've watched I've lost track but regardless this is an organization that is at the head of the fight there at the front\nOf the fight for the right to keep and bear arms and it's an honor to be asked to go out there and do so last year I could not because of my wife's condition I was not traveling for that for a year so that we could get this\nBreast cancer think past us which we have successfully done thank God and that enabled me to get out there this year so much going on what was it was either emotional week\nFor a lot of different reasons not the least of which of course because my wife has completed overtreatment as of a two days ago of yesterday actually when her chemo port was taken out\nBut because it coincided with the Arizona citizens defense league that I couldn't go to the year before I could now and it just made for a a great week a great way to wrap up which kind of difficult year which is fine fine

but if that's the case\nWhy is it Arizona citizens defense league is necessary in the first place\nHow many more rights do we need restored quite a few let me give you one indication of what I noticed

more important to you than constitutional carry\nAnd I could easily easily make that case\nI don't care if I can carry it without a permit some people would say I have a permit I don't really care I'd rather be able to carry in more places\nSo you know it's six to one half dozen the other what's good for the goose might not be good for the gander so I've heard all of these arguments some people

I don't have any more info I haven't followed up on that yet your email is a reminder for me to do that I shot a couple of emails out to some folks in the know down there one in law enforcement one of them of course Lee Williams the gun writer from Sarasota Herald Tribune will be talking with him\nProbably over the weekend if not on Monday I'll see what I can find out about that okay\nHe continues on the ... ladies and gentlemen case you run a word this was the guy who basically night the puppy from a balcony of an apartment complex we were discussing it a few weeks ago guys are real low life guys are real comeback used in air rifle scopes air rifle to do so and killed a little eight year old girls puppy\nThat her mother was walking for her I mean just absolutely static regardless anyway we'll we'll follow up on that\nHe continues with the email anyway I'll be flying to Texas in December for a wedding and was wondering about how to take my carry guns with me\nI've checked the TSA website as well as the American airlines and no it should be unloaded and it'll locked box\nI question is in regards to the ammo I Know it should be in the packaging but does it also have to be inside the lock box with a firearm I've seen a few pages saying I can just toss it in my checked bag but would want to be sure before I end up in a situation I don't want to be and I carry a glock twenty six and a ... every day great choices by the way\nIf I take both of them do they have to be in separate locked containers thank you keep up the great work it would be nice if you added an extra hour or two to your Daily Show it would certainly\nCan keep up the great work it would be nice if you added an extra hour or two to your Daily Show it would certainly make my day on the road a lot more interesting sincerely Raphael Martinez ... first of all thank you regarding the extra hours believe me there's not enough time and this one hour to cover everything I've like\nNonetheless you never know what we're working on right you just never know there's a lot\nThat goes into it because they're satellite times channels and\nA lot lots of people involved behind the scenes but you just never know okay we're in our fourth year of the armed American radio Daily Show now and I'm loving every minute of it on in a few dozen stations around the country obviously we would like to continue to grow that so uh you just as I'll just leave it with this you just never know but\nLet me tell you a little bit about get I get this Everytime I travel someone inevitably right to be just that I'm Glad I'm Glad I get the email because it gives me an opportunity to keep you from finding yourself in trouble as Raphael mentioned here let me give you the straight doping the easiest way to do this first of all\nI carried to guns with me to Arizona this past week to and fro\nI carried a glock forty three and I carried a glock Seventy I Love my clock Seventeen love love love my clock Seventeen\nLike locked forty three oh I don't know why would I carry that\nWell I'll tell you why because you just never know in Arizona where you can and can't carry your gun mum\nSo the forty three concealed incredibly well it's a little bit easier to conceal that smaller gun than it is the bigger gun even when I'm using something like a cross reached super talk for example that hold those guns very very well and makes them disappear\nThe fact of the matter is there's physics involved so nonetheless those are the two guns I carried I carried in I have a particular carry case that I use\nA center of math safe\nAnd I have the medium sized safe both guns fit in it perfectly actually I have the small of a smaller one that I travel with both guns fit perfectly in that center of math say can find it on line just Google it up\nI carry the forty three and the Seventeen both magazines inserted\nIn the center of ... both magazines and the lock the box put it that's the hard sided container off you know that goes into your suitcase I carry one box of ammunition twenty round I didn't carry extra magazines with\nTwenty round box of ... excuse me of ammunition that I put in the suitcase separate because it's simply wouldn't fit in the locked container you can put it in the locked container if you have a bigger container but\nWe don't need to go that route all you're doing this carrying the glock twenty six in the ... the put them in one container you don't need to separate locked containers but the locks container has to be a container that only you have a key to it can't be one of the ones with the TSA deal on it this is a locked container that only you have the key\nTo\nThat goes in the suitcase one box a man about winning the suitcase feel free to take more up to eleven pounds if you want to do that and ... pounds of ammo that's up to you\nYou just tossed that am all in the suitcase you remember the ammunition doesn't need to be declared firearm needs to be declared so he got locked box with two guns in it that only you have the key to it is locked you have the ammo in the suitcase declare that if the ticket counter that you are carrying a firearm you will fill out a little orange card\nThat claims under penalty of perjury\nThat your guns are unloaded I have not had to show my guns to a ticket agent in quite some time you never know sometimes they want to see the guns most of the time they do not\nAnyway you're still going to have to open up the bad because you got to take that little firearm card that you sign and that the ticket ... or ... at the gate ... I'm Sorry the ticket agent signs as well and you're going to put it inside the suitcase\nOn top of your clothing your going to close that box up and one of two things are going to happen they're either going to have somebody come over with and walk it's oversized so the TSA can search it or they're going to take it over to X ray on their own either way you're going to wait for it they're going to clear you know if you go\nSo let's wrap that up one more time\nGun or guns in a locked hard sided container that only you have the key to like I did you can put both guns in the same locked hard sided container\n... in a box Stewart box or container made for carrying ammo you can't put it in the ... for example goes in the bag separately this is just the way I Do it so you've got the box with the guns lock box with a gun or gun\nBoth in the same box you don't need to have to separate boxes ... separate in the bag\nDeclare it when you get to the counter tell them you have a firearm you'll fill out the orange card you will sign it they will initially you will slip it on top of your clothing or wherever they tell you to put it inside your luggage you'll close your luggage they were more than likely walk you through TSA TSA will then go through your little luggage thing they'll make\nPrior to the civil war slaves were disarmed and even though the war in the end of slavery\nThe law made it legal only to carry a quote unquote high quality army slash navy pistol\nWhich costs several months wages and prices former slaves out of their rights ... where we've seen that tactic before right\nWhen such laws were rewritten to make them fair the police selectively enforce them laws enforce those laws against blacks or India eventually that\nSome laws enforce those laws against blacks or India eventually the eastern us adopted may issue licensing giving authority to a judge city council were police chief to issue or denial license the first such law was the fellows in law in New York what is not well publicized as the way and reason to solve in law came about\nIn of course was soldiers crime control but it is the opposite of that goal\nTim Sullivan was the leader of the Irish five points New York city gang right it was written into law to allow him solving to issue or deny a license to his gang and associates and deny license arrival then the police would be able to arrest gang rivals caught with an unlicensed gun\nThat became the pattern of gun laws and Democrats cities and also explain why crime goes up because it was intended to a certain criminals\nIn the Old West cowboys and other transient Indians drunks and settled trans didn't have easily concealed guns and could be seen to be on\nToday we have metal detectors in screen airline

standards that comes to us from Jim ... went from he's listening on cake you am\nWhich is a big talker gym there is so much meat in this thing to go over\nLet's start with your first two lines the herbs gun control laws are were unconstitutional but as the laws in the old south they weren't forced with lots of discretion or prejudice that makes them unconstitutional again\nI knew right then and there James I was going to be reading your email on the air [laughter] didn't take long to figure that out because we talked about that this week\nIn fact I had other emailer said to me you know I find it ironic that you were in tombstone\nAndy herbs were enforcing gun control or their brand or a version of gun control which is what started the gunfight at the OK Corral that letter writer\nDidn't listen to the rest of it before he went oh he did talk about that being I'd have a four story if in fact that the earth's we're trying to enforce their brand of gun control so we've discussed this previously I don't want to go into too much of it but what I think is the key here is where you say there were unconstitutional because they were\nAnd then the way they the way that they in forced them\nWith lots of discretion or prejudice that\nMakes them unconstitutional again what you've just told us James and maybe you weren't even aware of it I'm sure you are but I'm going to make it clear in case you weren't but certainly for listeners\nAnd then the bigger picture of what you are telling us is all gun control is unconstitutional all gun control is an infringement all gun control is enforced with a certain level of discretion or prejudice\nI eat as in who get permits in may issue states the process itself is unconstitutional the permit itself is unconstitutional the right of the people\nTo keep and bear arms shall not be infringed as long as the people have gotten a permit [noise]\nDo you follow me all gun control is unconstitutional\nNow you know it will be
