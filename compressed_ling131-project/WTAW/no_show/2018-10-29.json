know how to and I'm not young but I'm I'm new at this father to the point that I was getting it like this doesn't sound like mommy style mommy I couldn't understand what was going on\nI was recorded but at one point\nThe federal registrar there was a century on our feet put out\nThere in Ninety Days they wanted bids on watching companies to move kids\nFrom unknown places unknown cities but on the southern border of the United states to unknown destination to be better on on a mileage bitter essentially like we'll figure that out later you tell us what these kids are because they had to publish at the register\nOf course ... either Obama or the wide open borders dispersed around America and you know one third of all living in El Salvador and live not an El Salvador they live in America\nWe have every week about two thousand showing up on our southern border two thousand a week yeah put it in the numbers it's a hundred thousand or more a I'm Sorry I'm not a week two thousand per day we have seven hundred thousand a legal showing up on the southern border\nThe great majority are given due process hearing are the three to five years from now and will never take place that is they melt down on the southern border with diseases and what skills we don't need with individuals who are illegal and the Democratic party is shift completely in twenty oh six Obama voted for a border fence\nThat didn't Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer what twelve years ago the Democratic party wanted border fences to be built they wanted illegals out of the country when they started losing elections they figure it out well let's make Texas\nA blue state let's flood taxes with the illegals make them legal to vote and then we can win Texas ... wins taxes and that guy is a fool and a clown

officer\nInvestigator detective Thomas Russian will be here to talk about the investigation of what happened in Pittsburgh later on a Sam Nunberg will be here works with Steve Bannon on his way out to Nevada to talk about the Trump media a respect or lack there up by CNN later on as David Wray affair federation of American immigration\nReform to talk about the medical conditions happening on the southern border and more aligned becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the Boston Red Sox world champion taking on the Dodgers four to five getting built counting undergrad American\nNor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had it goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish ... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president\nIs one of many causing it so when you were in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nGo back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say what did he do when did he do it who did you send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media counts three fifty seven magnitude since and blocks\nThat were legally purchased and they are Fifteen they're still trying to think down and see what it is\nA ... if someone is posting anti Semitic slurs and saying I'm going in and they have guns now isn't that another tempted something's about to happen\nThat's what you would hope you would hope being from the polish Pittsburgh Police departments standpoint that you would have gotten a call or the FBI would have gotten a call and then if you drop the ball is law enforcement agency [laughter] and it's on you but in this case nothing I have seen about ... hours\nShowed any thing\nTo indicate that he was becoming radicalized and he was becoming what we call lone wolf\nAnd they was going to do something other than his rants till right before you went in yesterday when he said I'm going in and if police knew about it and that will come to light if they didn't then why didn't someone else who saw this alert police\nThomas rescue and you have some doubt how many other Robert Bowers are running around this country and I would assume there are several thousand just like him\nIn the nation at three hundred and forty million people ... and let's face in America is the most pro Jewish pro Israel Israel especially with with Trump in the White House nation on the face\nOf the earth and this is the place or were were were were Jews do well there's about three million or so three and a half million Jews in America disproportionately successful\nGoes a faith and family because the connections to go some hard work because of academics\nDisproportionate success\nAnd so those who are jealous or whatever they got to have a scapegoat for the failures in their life and they look at someone successful so many Jews disproportionately succeed in business and entertainment and finance and the law in Madison and I found it so ... that\nThis afternoon on CNN there was an interview of a doctor who treated Bowers who unfortunately lived\nIn that doctor is Jewish at the Pittsburgh hospital and a couple of the nurses who treated him and said this life or Jewish isn't that unbelievable that that that somehow powers were saved by by Jews in the hospital unbelievable\nCould've been a Jewish cop who responded to the synagogue to to save other people people in their\nProfession to be doctors lawyers on the burn C. area's being doctors police officers firemen don't look at who the saving or what they've done\nThey know what they're sworn to do and that's what they do and that's what the doctors in that hospital even though he had killed eleven Jewish people in a synagogue or with their prey\nSaved his life and that's what they do and that's what cops too and that's what firemen do and that's what these doctors did and God Bless them for that\nWas talking about the SARS ... who was the mentally ill deranged individual they ran around on the white van I guess his band was a ... was an attempt to bomb making factory some have said when someone in a white man has those kinds of ah a Heidi Asians on the side CNN sucks also had scopes\nOn Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that something should have been done in your years in New York City as a cop Thomas ...\nHow many unusual situations like that did you observe\nMore than I can count but I Will tell you this you know there are laws and there are reasons for stopping someone and questioning them and maybe he didn't violate the law the fact\nThat he's expressing his First Amendment right to express speech on the outside of his car doesn't necessarily give you a right to pull him over and or questioned him unless he violates some other kind of law now we don't even know if the police had any interaction with him\nRelative to as thin as of yet down there but you know at the point in time I'm sure\nWhere it went down to about ... aka\nA Florida with the bombs had been sent proved that distribution center\nAnd then in the area plantation where he was taken into custody I wouldn't be surprised to certain people start to make calls on him prior to the police come into contact with him or learning his identity through his finger print\nAnd that was tying in simultaneously with them identifying\n... is the potential bomber\nAnd you know these acts of terror are taking place sadly quite frequently\nJust on Wednesday a criminal who sent a rise in light materials to the home of US Senator Susan Collins was arraigned on the Trump children the adult children have received numerous\nNumerous rise in on a attempted it looked like rising and blows who powder in the mail including us defense secretary James Mattis and practically every\nHigh ranking Trump official has been threatened with death because Ted Cruz and others changed completely out of restaurants you Senator Mitch McConnell in Louisville, Kentucky chased out of a restaurant\nYou have a ... a United States are congressmen and Republican in uh in California had a switch blade pulled on attempted to stab him running for the Congress\nThe candidate clobbered that would be assassin before the man could get the blade out of a malfunctioning\nKnife there are numerous examples in the last several months\nWhere powder scent where are the candidates who sent with their heads decapitated ... and I I Can't recall a time other than the late Nineteen sixty sixty eight when the country paired almost to be to be coming apart the Drudge Report\nSays that the usa on edge do have a sense that something is different about the political climate now than it's been years ago Thomas ...\nOh yeah the rhetoric on both sides of the oil have become this rural and have become terrible and we have to dial it back I mean I've said in numerous appearances recently that if this continues on a leash or going to be busier than they've ever been before and it's not\nJust Donald Trump and not just the right is for left [laughter] everyone has to understand some of the McCain way of thinking that we have to work together we can have our political views and we can look at things from different lenses that are different experiences and how we were growing up [noise]\nOr all Americans and if we're not able to work with each other or help each other or save each other the way that they do after a hurricane and the way the police officers around this country to every single day\nThey don't look at the color whether religion or the\nPerson that they're saving they respond because that's what they wanted to do and they risk their lives to save anyone that they potentially could save because that's what they're calling\nI I don't know I like the president I loved the guy spent time with him we speak now and then he's a great political character\nI look at his results more than look at his words but I I don't recall words being used by him along the lines of the words and they used as president then I hear on the left but the media covers the Trump words differently and then they covered get democratic words and and uh\nThe Trump words differently and then they covered get democratic words\nAnd uh and I I Wish there was a quality between the two\nBut as you said the election now is only a little more than a week away and at this point it would behoove all of us to lower down the ready rhetoric a little bit because there's hundreds of thousands on the left and on the right\nNow they're waiting it'd be triggered by some event in many are mentally ill and many have guns now that doesn't mean any of us Tom Russ get needs to stop exercising or free speech rights on their constitution\nBut it does mean that that that the media also plays a role in this one I've been watching CNN the past two days all I hear about is Trump and the Republicans responsible\nFor almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to the tide Donald Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh\nEven though he's the only president in American history Deb Jewish grandchildren the only one in today's CNN tried to tee up the U.S Israeli ambassador the as the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. I'm Sorry\nAnd he said that the best friend Israel's ever had\nHas been Donald J Trump and that he's been wonderful for Israel and Trump is not responsible for what happened there the president's going to go to Pittsburgh and the next couple of days\nTo meet with those that have been wounded summer mortally wounded not likely to survive the number eleven is likely to go up and the president has said that it's time to lower the writer rhetoric just a little bit but the other side doesn't want to accept that in fact CNN\nAnd the Washington Post or indirectly accusing the president of the murders in Pittsburgh and that is despicable man we we've got a calmness down\nAnd they look as if that ... a little overweight for now we're going to have an election\nMay want to gin up the numbers to hurt the president hurt Republicans I Hope it doesn't work but but Tom what you said about calming down relaxing a little bit when you're in New York City when I had my TV show there for five years completely different I live now in Cincinnati completely different culture a completely different things are going on\nThis is W.

Jersey barriers basically the concrete barriers we see between the on the on the freeway yeah those you know they stand about ah three feet tall and they're up to Fifteen twenty feet long\n... Jersey barrier and I do not know why they're called Jersey Jersey barriers maybe there's something I didn't know of Chris Christie had something to their might administration\nOut there that would tell you that if only there were way we could look\nIt up and All right I'll look it up anyway ah\nThey've started moving the barriers to the border with Mexico and uh that there are plans to deploy active duty troops\nAs well as the other things as well he's his comments came a as the care of and slowly making its way north in Mexico still a thousand miles from us America these additional troops whose numbers has not been disclosed yet will provide logistical and other support to the border patrol and\nAlso bolster the two thousand National Guard troops that are also\nThere well the caravan does that consist of vehicles I thought it was just folks while you know it's just people okay so what what would the Jersey barriers do pick ... well\nNo that gives you a but it gives you a physical barrier to slow them down right there I don't know if you didn't whack 'em in the face as they come\nAugust for so and Trump said he's going to build a wall this what he\nHad well I Know it out of it is but that ... foot high concrete them you know that's what we discussed with the congressman the other day and\nHe said you know wall is a lot of different things and sometimes it is a physical wall but sometimes it'll be something different it was seemed to me like they'd have time to put up a real wall since they're a thousand miles away yeah how long is this going to take yeah and uh so anyhow whether\nA Jersey barriers also known in the western United States is Kay rail a term borrowed from the California Department of transportation for Haitian\nYeah so there you go or not going to do they were to balance in the fifties beginning in the U.S state of New Jersey oh that's the ... go\nAll right so you may have heard reports of people who are trying to vote straight ticket\nAnd it ended up showing them people other than they wanted to vote for a little bit of controversy is a came a came to light a friday I think in Harris County well so we've had a little chance to look at the situation and basically the state of Texas is saying it's your fault\nYou know they have to be in certain there are only eighty two counties in Texas that are using the voter system where they've had the problems\nBrass this county is one of those counties oh now what's interesting is um the largest county with the most to register voters Harris parent and Travis also use them\nBut they're only eighty two counties other two hundred and fifty four who are using these now here's what the secretary of state's office is saying though\nNot not their fault not the this company's fault in their statement they said now simply that a voter inputs a says the state on friday heart east like that's the company who makes him had\nI'm simply record it's simply records the voters input it does not and cannot\nFlip or switch votes so basically what they're saying is in the U.S secretary of state's office\nYou have punched you the voter have punch something but you have not allow the machine to accept it\nSo when you cast the ballot in fact deletes the vote that you had an implicit in the other person's a column if you will\nSo the thing to do is is if you vote it says is the very end review every place that you have you know everybody who you voted for you may not have voted in some racism is fine but you have a chance to double check your work\nAnd if not then you hit that little thing that says back\nBack back back back back back back and then he goes back to the proper page and then you vote for who you actually wanted to vote for\nSo are these are folks who are bringing a stink about this are they the ones like at the very end they say oh well that's not right whenever it gives you the the reviewer and look\nAt Iraq but what what you didn't do as you did not allow the machine to um record if you will the the choices that you made on that page before you went to the next page and that's where the mess up and\nHonestly I don't think this is just a personal thing with me I'm never going to sit there and press that I'm going to vote district ticket\nWell yeah and the thing is though especially here you can't because you've got a school board races you guys riot council races near propositions in College Station recordings of them the voting machines have this inner button and it has a little selection we'll okay to help voters select their candidate\nThe office advises voters to use one button at a time and not to hit the enter button or use the selection we'll until the page is fully what they call rendered ... if Texans are having issues they should ask the poll worker for assistance immediately\nAnd do not cast a ballot before you carefully reviewed the summary screen at the end to ensure that it has been listed correctly so again and that could happen in ... county\nBut they say statewide they've only had twenty incidences of any problem for a lot of you know for\nAll the outlet right right and that's the other day I mean I don't know that's just scary to think that your vote that you put that in there and on the\nOn the you're going to go to the trouble of doing that you may as well vote for the person who you intended to be but it's not she's full and secretary stays offices just be careful and then finally most importantly branches county is one of the counties that uses so sorry six forty seven\nThirty five years Thanksgiving in

B. communications director bench coming in the morning thank you for having me that morning and as tradition as we have a gift\nYes we do have carry Baker was house with us today I\nKnow the stranger as we were introduced us or you're a couple of weeks ago a boat so Scottish Ross was much more than than sort those sort of know very\nIf not already a critical component Nichols staff member a for those who are not familiar with the Scottish house and the work that you all doing Nebraska valley to lead off with that\nSure yeah Scott he's houses the child advocacy center of the ... valley we work with law enforcement and CPS to provide a safe place where children can come\nAnd disclosed abuse they can receive a forensic interview a forensic medical exam we connect the families with resources and the community and one of them is United Way especially to one one and then we also provide counseling to children and their families\nAs I point out whenever agency representatives come a reminder that this United Way of the branches bally's it's not just ... county\nExactly yeah Scott each house serve this that serve the seven counties and so it's wonderful to have another resource that also represents the southern county says well\nIt may be on a proportional bases but do you find any more or less business from from the rural counties yeah\nWe do you know brothers county makes up about fifty percent of our caseload and then that's surrounding counties compromise the remaining ... percent\nAnd that would mean a proportional higher percentage are withdrawing goes ... it's more than fifty percent of the population in Brunswick County right yeah it to do the types of cases differ urban versus rural\nNo they don't you know the majority of the cases we see about Seventy percent um our children who've experienced some form of sexual abuse\nAnd then we serve children who have experienced severe physical abuse\nAnd then we also provide services to children who have witnessed a violent crime and maybe they had seen domestic violence or they have witnessed a murder and we also work with children who are in ... drug endangered environment so they are in a home where drugs are being manufactured or distributed we will provide services to those children as well\nWhat those you know where the brands valley do to help the for the Scottish house\nRight so a lot of our services are very reactive we um are involved after abuse has occurred and so we're lucky to have a partner like United Way because they help us focus on prevention and so they find a project a joint project between Scott his house and the prenatal clinic where we are working with the parents to\nTry to change behaviors and prevent abuse before it ever occurs\nWater or the circumstances that that you're trying to change the behavior in the adult so that that cycle stops\nRight you know we're one of the biggest things as you know you have a baby and you go home from the hospital and you know nothing and so we're trying to talk to parents um to moms and dads about\nMaternal health how important it is to take care of the mom and her stress level I'm One of the easiest things we do is help them think through if you get overwhelmed who can you call\nHim here's a list of phone numbers of people that you've already talked to that if you just or at your wits end because you have a crying baby which is often when their infants you can call anyone here and they can come in and they can help you\nUm so that you don't ever you know resort to some kind of physical violence towards your child\nAnd I would think of it even goes past the physical violence when when when one of the parents get so frustrated\nPast the physical violence when when when one of the parents get so frustrated they're they're yelling and maybe they're just showing it themselves but the child hears of\nYeah exactly you know they also not only yelling just in general but at their spouse that their partner and so you know helping them understand that children's brains are constantly developing and they are taking ... and so really you know one it's okay to be frustrated but making sure you leave the child in a safe room and their crab\nAnd go you know have those disagreements somewhere else go you know the child still may be crying but it's okay you know babies are going to cry and sometimes they've eaten they have a clean diaper and they're just crying and so\nRather than doing something having it out with the person next to you leave the child and just go outside take a few minutes to to take a couple a deep breath and it really is um a way to calm yourself down and kind of help you refocus\nWho are the people the other on the line when when somebody calls\nWhen somebody calls guy's house\nOr when when when you when you got to have the parents phantom or who's on the other hand you know\nIt could be your neighbor it could be a family member who lives a few streets over it could be somebody from your church it's just anybody who you've had that conversation with ahead of time that\nYou you trust enough to come in and maybe it so you could go to a movie and sit by yourself but they'll they're happy to come in and sit with your child for a few hours just to give you a break because that's you know it's okay as parents to need a little bit of time for yourself in a time time away\nThey're helping them establish a support system and that they have a safety net call\nThat's exactly right and and cat it's not about having that you know when it's too late you know we want them to think through those things and and have that that in place before they need it\nHow do you find the parents that you want to serve\nSo we're lucky to have that partnership with the prenatal clinic because they serve over five hundred women a year and so there is our captive audience right there\nSo we provide a Scottish south we provide the content mattered that the expertise and child abuse and how to take care of your children and and the prenatal clinic has this wonderful population that they serve and they're coming in for multiple visit so they can get that information when they go for their regular pre natal appointment at the clinic\nWell I Want to also leave a little time as been talking about how you know one of the brands valley no those contributions helped to bring it according to Scotty cells in this program I also see the folder that you've Jerry just handed over to cast\nYeah you know I think it's so important for United Way their community campaign is what helps fund programs like that the partnership between the prenatal clinic and Scott is health\nAnd as much as the United way and Scotty south wants people to support the community campaign we use an agency believe in it as well and so our employees give back to the United way because we know not only does that fund programs like Scotty south but also helped other

welcome aboard we are of course talking about what do we do now\nBecause at some point we just have to come up with a solution and stop listening to the idiots on Twitter or the idiots on the news media the fake news media\nUm we also have to stop pretending originally though the Asian between news media and fake news media there is even some conservatives have fallen for it the president should stop attacking the media you know the media is not the enemy of other people know the media is not the fake news media is the fake\nNews media is beyond me because it's delivering fake news\nIncorrect stories inaccurate on purpose to sway your opinion or to change people's minds that's a problem that's a real problem he's not saying good news media is the enemy of the people using the fake news media is and guess what he's allowed he's got a First Amendment to\nHe's allowed to say that but more important than that than the attacks and the president for saying what he's been saying for a while more important news how do we solve the problem of of shootings a soft target ...\nWas it fifty people in Las Vegas at a concert\nYou get no eleven people with a synagogue Seventeen at the high school in Parkland, Florida thirty two at Virginia Tech Thirteen Columbine twelve of the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado meat but that was enough now I mean people these bad guys are choosing\nSoft targets ... soft target versus a hard target you know we use these terms as if we're you know like the news media will say that he fled on foot when we ran away ... let's let's just put it was playing speak please speak is\nThe bad guys are targeting places they know they will get no resistance\nThey're targeting places it misses a ... of Aurora, Colorado that bad guy had an option of six different movie theaters he chose the one that didn't allow concealed carry let that sink you know why would have done that actually pretty simple you did that because she knew nobody would be shooting back\nOkay\nAt Sutherland Springs the bad guy chose a target where he was confident there was nobody with a gun safely Steven Wolf or was not for any chased him down and stopped what might have turned out to be two hundred people killed\nVirginia Tech the police on Cuba's recalled and be responded they did a good job responding but they weren't able to react\nThis story though from I'm from Pittsburgh v the liberal mayor there um has some ... some people say this sort of is a microcosm of what I've been saying which is the left really does believe\nThat more laws that's these are helping out here\nFrom the blaze Pittsburgh the Democratic Mayor Bill to do though is going on and meet the press Sunday that he doesn't believe that more armed guard that places of worship are the answer and at the appropriate response to Saturday's mass murder the tree of lines synagogue in Pittsburgh is more gun control\nAnd bearing on NBC's flagship Sunday news program producer that I Belong to an organization a bipartisan organization called the Mayors Against illegal guns I don't think the answer to this problem solved by having a synagogue mocked and churches\nFilled with armed guards or a school filled with armed guards Mayors Against illegal guns as an anti gun group formed by former New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg but it will continue to we should try to stop a rational behavior from happening at the forefront and not try and create lawns around irrational behavior to continue\nAnd but it it was responding to comment made by president Donald Trump for a campaign rally on Saturday afraid of the tragedy President Trump said this is a case where if they had had an armed guard and side they might have been able to stop and immediately isn't it a shame that we even have to think of that inside of a temple or inside of a church but certainly the result might have been far better\nSuspect in Saturday's mass murder has been charged with dozens of federal crime so far including murder and hate crimes he additionally faces numerous possible prosecutions are violations of Pennsylvania law and the killer social media profiles are rife with anti Semitic comments including comments that disparaged President Trump for having too many Jews and his administration\nAnd put it all has a link the history of that hearing to liberal causes in opposition to President Trump including a promise that the city of Pittsburgh would continue to follow the Paris climate agreement temperature President Trump announced the country's withdrawal from the protocol\nSo just so so people understand this exactly makes my point\nThere's got to do was surrounded by good guys with guns\nHe was protected for the police she was probably nearby you probably had several other either a uniformed or or plainclothes officers nearby am willing to take somebody down had they threatened his life I'm not here to see it shouldn't be that way you know the mayor should be protected\nSo why would he as he is being protected as Cuomo does every time he speaks in New York Bloomberg does every time he speaks they're all surrounded by good guys with guns to protect them as they say that's not what's going to fix it\nIf they believed that they wouldn't have anybody with a gun anywhere near them\nBut they wouldn't take that chance and I don't blame them because they'd be in harm's way\nSo stop it because they're basically saying let them eat cake they're basically saying we have plenty of food there are other people who need some food screw them let them eat cake\nWell we enjoy the pot roast or the ...\nThe steak and lobster it really is the same thing\nBecause if you walk out and say nobody should have guns and guns are bad and with the new legislation you shouldn't be surrounded by people with guns\nYou should allow them the people that you're speaking to to enjoy the same safety you do you're basically\nLike the let them eat cake example putting himself with a pedestal I'm more important than you are I should make sure that I Am protected and if you're not protected all complain about bad laws are not enough laws it's very strange yet that's the way that we see it or they see it so I've asked for somebody who's on the left to call in\nAnd give me an example of what a piece of legislation looks like or what a solution looks like from your perspective I told Arizona left Arun welcome to the program what's going on\nAnd go hey uh\nSo uh my my question is\nA very big watering ... anywhere in a or and or or a ... ... or the coffee or\nA government that has increased gun population increase and armed its citizens and at the same time as decrease the amount of gun violence and got an accident\nOr ... yes absolutely I mean just look up a book by John lot\nThat's L. O. T. T. read up for yourself not really sure why you called and asked me a question but the government does an arm anybody 'cause you just said the whole premise of your of your question was can you do me a place for domestic where the government has armed with the people\nAnd the the crime rate or the going rate of the murder rate has gone down yes it happens all the time when good guys are armed to\nVent bad guys avoid them that's the way it works I'll give you an adverse example that actually makes my point and maybe because you sound like a smart guy maybe you'll understand it better well you've got laws like in Washington DC where nobody can own a gun you got it out of\nWell you've got laws like in Washington DC where nobody can own a gun you got it out of control gun murder rate when you've got a place like Chicago where nobody's allowed to own a gun legally you've got an out of control murder rate why Iran do you think that's happening\nYou know I think he's still there Cary air it was my major head hurt [laughter] come on\nHis head hurt my question was so so in other words no look I did not hang up on there and I didn't put on hold\nHe asked me a question which wasn't the whole idea of the idea was if you're on the left or if you're a Democrat tell me what you would do instead he thought he would ask me a question that I guess would corner me or something\nAnd maybe my answer I got to tell you that you're proud and I agree with you carry my answer was so good and that and you get them off the phone and stand that actually pretty sure no pretty sure you were thinking you know I mean that is rematch wearing sure so air and yet ... dumb question specious question do you favor going get John lots book\nA I've never had a lot I was going to one point but he likes get along very well but having said that he is the forty on this go and get his book and there is statistical after statistic after statistic\nThat shows that where you've got a heavily armed illegally heavily armed community you go lower gun violence rates because the bad guys are not willing to take the chance it's the same deterrent you know I talk about this all the time and say it again I think it's a good example\nTerry and I both have the same car instead of her car's a flashing red light to noting there's an alarm inside my car there is not a flashing red light McCarthy was going to steal one of them the car he was going to steal or she's going to steal is going to be the one that will offer the path of least resistance\nIf he or she opens the car door for Kerry's car an alarm will go off opens my car door one won't go off\nIt's very simple are not going to go in to a convenience store that has a sign out front that says we have for employees all of whom were carrying guns\nI'm going to go into the one that says no guns allowed here\nThat if I'm a bad guy that wants to Rob the joint that's what I'm Talking about so so Aaron I hear ya\n... and I wish you the very best\nBut your question didn't make any sense 'cause she didn't do any a little bit of research on it to find out you know the answer was before you pose that I think you thought you do what do you get your was but you weren't\nSo I've got a bunch of other people on the line you carry but I've got a guy named Franklin ... who just called is have you been holding you got to be patient with me Franklin claims that he's a Democrat he wants to argue or I or still frankly what are you got for me\nAnd go hey oh same nothing I guess if there\nIs a little bit of delay it nor the egg nor the television what's on your mind\nDo ... what did you say makes no sense that given analogy that because I don't have gotten in my house someone exactly like I mean\nI I don't know what you do is I mean you just said well you just said it's not something that I said what what what specifically do that makes sense\nYou said they knew you just said well maybe ... ... like you said you will go into place because they said guns are not allowed here\nI didn't have when you're going to guide never I never said which is that what what I said was if I'm a bad guy and I want to go\nI Want to go Rob a convenience store one convenience store has a sign that says we are for employees here that I'll have guns and the other convenience store says no guns allowed ... now you gotta they gotta dumped them polo and on television or you can grab that in time or not but you know you knew that frankly was going to go there\nYou know that he was going to go there and actually tried to recall but it was an up and running\nA sort of gets [noise]\nHow I Want\nPeople who are listening in watching to understand right now in ... by the way you're listening on on my heart that they we don't edited on my heart goes out on the Internet but on television radio we had a dump something that he said I'm\n\nFrankly just said Jerry make sure that I I heard him right\nUh-huh I Am a punk\nBecause if I were in a punk\nI Would go to the convenience store they have all the guns and I would take the guns away from the uh yeah so that he did I hear him correctly you did follows that is that\n... yeah pretty much\nActually so he didn't like my example [laughter] ... was go in\nAnd try to rub the store with four people with guns because if you're not a punk like bags you'll just take their guns away alright grades field when we come back on the job had shows there\nIt's it's not happening I find that when I go to a restaurant and I see that side and I ended up leaving my my firearm and the trunk of my vehicle I go in and I talked I get one chance I talked to him here's why your state but what we just had a McDonald's in Alabama yesterday I don't know if you saw this ... ... ... father\nWho's a concealed handgun license holders stops at an armed intruder in this McDonalds inspiring shots gunfire ensues\nAn an armed intruder in this McDonalds is firing shot gun fire ensues he shoots and it kills the guy coming in to do who knows what it could have been a mass shooting this McDonald's with customers in there and what would it we've been seeing today we would've had lived trucks from every TV station across the country in the parking lot of that McDonalds instead\nThere's nothing on the national media about this this was a story where a guy save lives didn't take them but that's not the story they want\nA guy walked into McDonalds started shooting and and as you say the good guy took out he was gone it was there with his son's he's got his gun shield the guy he was injured himself he's going to be okay but you're right there will be no lights shut on this because that in fact we make our point that thirty two don't die in Virginia Tech\nIf if a teacher and professor could have had a gun that people might not have died in Sandy Hook if a teacher in the ministry and or some sort of a Marshall in the school had a gun I'm naturally the bottom line but you're you're hearing already we need commonsense gun legislation\nThere was a mass shooting at at a synagogue there was a shooting this morning I guess at a school somewhere um we this is not too soon we need do you have any idea what exactly the laws are other than getting rid of the second amendment that ... that they say will help because I have not heard one suggestion from one of these left these\nThat says if you do this this would have prevented that\nWell you you just nailed it and so I used to say for a long time last year and and long before that that they're coming for the second amendment the way they get there is straight through the n._r._a. they know that that is the biggest offender or the second amendment once they do away with the second amendment it's going to be a free for all for the constitution I used to be called a crazy man\nFor making that prediction then but then what have we seen we see a former Supreme Court justice and says that the second amendment needs to be overturned you got left wing politicians just about everyone you can think of er name\nHas made a public statement that says the second amendment should be repealed or done away with and I'm not crazy anymore for saying that they are now openly admitting\nThat that is what they want but we know Joe that's not going to work they're not going to get there I don't think the American people won it overwhelmingly the majority of Americans do not side with this idea of gun control they blame Congress we're not getting done a Congress has just been listening to the people the people don't want it\nYeah well they they don't want to because that right and I I saw that you did earlier I'm ... years ago ... TV I make sure you go and check them out a great stuff on YouTube is well\nI saw some video where you were talking about this and in the bottom line was for some reason the left gives all sorts agreements to a bunch of other amendments but the second amendment is not looked at as a writer it's maybe get some you know an added later saying that that really we should do away with not because most gets\nUm you're right in your assessment that the second amendment is as important if not more important than the others because it's actually in place I Believe to protect the rest of them\nIt is\nThe second amendment wasn't really about\nHunting larger practice it's not\nIt's not and it was about think about our founding fathers and what they had just gone through right think about what early America was like when you are at war with England a tyrannical ruler the second amendment they wrote it because they didn't want to be ruled like tyranny and they knew that if they had done that was protection\nAnd what is the first nation do that's going to go down the path of charity or dictatorship or socialism or whatever you want to call it they disarm the people\nAnd so I Do believe there are forces at play in America that want the people disarm and it's a power plant is nothing to do with the safety\nThen there's the others that are people that are blind shape and they just follow their leaders who want the power and it feels good for them and it's emotional for them to say let's just not have any guns anywhere but those people are not thinking they've been duped\nI warn you not to have a conversation with because it'll make your head hurt they don't know anything about firearms they don't know anything about the second amendment a short reading of the federalist papers or the actual constitution itself\nWe will make it very clear to you the second amendment and all the men which really are there ... there in ... writes granted by the creator protected by this document document tells you gonna what are you can't do\nAnd the second amendment clearly was put in there as basically the founding fathers saying never again it's that he wants to go shoot the deer wasn't go get some food for dinner although that's nice there wasn't go uh go down to compete and to target a bitter shoot it was never again will does happen or it it's great to go ahead\nWell I was just going to say Joe you know under the never again model right President Trump came out yesterday and said there was no armed security inside the synagogue and he was vilified for saying that these two brand police officers were injured that went in and stop the shooter interrupted the shooting spree\nGot the shooter to to retreat saved who knows how many lives Jill they were there in one minute yeah can you imagine if a concealed handgun license holder an armed security guard was in there and engaged him within five seconds or ten seconds how many lives would have been said\nAnd yet the president has vilified for common sense do that gun control in the end of that common sense you know that that that's all we\nDid the Saturday's shooting ended because good guy showed up with guns and to the guy out a ... of course the greenhouse don't enter a TV uh people are dying to know the innocent and I don't mean to to say dying but people really really want to know this\nUm what do they do we go to church we go to synagogue we're going to school we go to a grocery store we go to the mall we go to theaters what do we do because it easy anymore that famous the open society where\nYou're pretty much gonna be okay don't worry about it at any time a bad guy is going to try to take advantage of a so called soft target\nThe carrying anyway even if they don't go don't go to places that don't offer protection don't go to places that don't let us carry what do you do\nA well person foremost you abide by the law that there is a sign in the window says you're not allowed to carry in there and you obviously you leave your fire on hold but I won't\nTell people to talk to the to the folks in their community whether it's your church whether it's people at your school and taught to them and figure out as they grew what you'd think it is is right for that organization that wants to protect itself now as an individual\nIf you feel comfortable or you or want to inquire about about a carrying a firearm will I Will get in touch with your local NRA instructor there's tons of them and start to get familiar with firearms\nGo through some training and are able to carry guard program which is absolutely phenomenal I'm On a three day course that I went through and teach you all about personal protection I tried to train as much as I possibly can I like going to the range 'cause I enjoy it but I also do it because it's my responsibility you most either Joe holders like this they train\nGet the training to the point where you feel comfortable Joe I get the firearms are not right for everybody my goal is to make sure that everyone in America with legally allowed to do so has the right if they want to carry\nIt I don't want to make everybody carry I just want you to exercise your right if you want to\nBut let me finish ... field I'm Indian or a European or a your own inner ATV I'm the first thing out of the left is always the ... just trying to sell more guns great have
