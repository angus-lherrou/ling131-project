sounded like an echo so that's actually kind of cool okay um so there you go see your voices sounding awfully chocolate he has a new studio have you on your really\nI Do I live in the very very than the around here\nIt'll take a little getting used to think of processing is is a little different maybe a little bit closer to the Mike than usual but either way you sound you're amazing so just don't you could tell you were to different place\n... okay now I'm just saying oh good okay All right\nIt is a an eight nine for one pack so or the ... do you have a nuts and bolts of what happened is we going to do even need it anymore but it happened Saturday\nWell yeah I Do have I mean the latest is even like it and you know Democrats are planning to do now let's let's do it\nOkay ah this is from Fox News the narrow confirmation him now justice Brett Kavanaugh the weekend marketing major political victory for President Trump and the beginning of a new battle for Democrats or now shipping their message to the right and possible impeachment against the newest tank or justice in question legitimacy and the Supreme Court itself\nAfter grueling confirmation fight than including graphic sexual misconduct allegations which the nominee denied Kevin I'm looking for Saturday on Fifteen a forty eight votes\nCeremonial swearing and will be held Monday evening and that and he joins the quarter placing retired Justice Anthony Kennedy prominent Democrat single the fight over a seat and the court itself will extend well beyond next month's midterms\nNow they went to impeach him it's an insult to the American public Trump's then Monday still feeling over the confirmation process and predicting Republican candidates and the only benefit from the controversy in the midterms and the crackdown maintain the fines energizing their core mental nonstop marching we will not stop fighting DNC chairman Tom ... statement\nOver the weekend former attorney general Eric Holder said the courts legitimacy should be brought into question with the addition Kavanaugh\nSo they're actually talking to an impeachment right All right so let's break that down who gets to impeach which body the house or the Senate and the Senate the house to house getting to bring\nA peach meant the Senate would say guilty or innocent or guilty or not guilty\nSo the Senate would actually hear the the trial but the house has to call for impeachment so I mean it's stupid it's a waste of time it's political wrangling it's dumb it's backward it's a disingenuous is ignorant it until it could just keep going good\n\n... the house right now cannot teach anybody because the Republicans or I guess they could if they're if they chose to to be for they won't\nRepublicans in the house or in support of ...\nThey chose to to obesity won't\nRepublicans in the house or in support of Brett Kavanaugh good\nAnd um I mean\nThere's there will be no impeachment unless the house goes to the Democrats in November ... here's the weird part for me the Democrats aren't smart enough to know I mean I don't think they're dumb generally speaking but this is a dumb move\n'em\nThey don't appear smart enough to know that the Republican and conservative base doesn't want red cabin on the beach and we don't want Donald Trump impeached just saying that he's going to be impeached\nYou use ridiculous that can only happen if they win the house they're actually hurting their chances of winning the house so\nHere I Am six six in one half dozen other do I want them to keep saying that they're going to impeach so that more Republicans and conservatives go and vote or don't want him to stop saying it because it's so stupid I don't know I I actually don't have a good answer for myself\nWhen I asked myself that question self what do I want oh I Love the Gary I'm going to answer I got ya but that's really where we are right I mean that that's really true we were we are\nWe're at a place where either the house does it real or the Democrats don't realize that they can and peace and let's say they have the majority and they don't\nNot neither house in his mouth from the Senate\nUm and are actually telling voters vote for us will raise your taxes we will send jobs away will make the unemployment rate go up we'll try to get a Medicare for all the tune of thirty two trillion dollars something we could never do\nOr we're going to impeach the president impeach the ... the Supreme Court justice was just place we basic that's a winning combination they actually think let's let's abolish ice let's open the border they think this was a winning combination\nSo I guess I kind of want them to keep yet but [laughter] I kinda wanted to keep on talking keep on saying stupid stuff and at the end of the day what you're going to have\nYou use or a Republican majority in both the house and Senate and then might gain and both the house and Senate so I guess I'm leaning towards ... saying it I don't know I guess that's that's what I Want I I Would guess\nNow I think they're gonna stop anytime soon either so\nI guess I just don't understand why they think democratic voters are going to be somehow empowered to go to the polls the typical Democrats a center left leaning person is not a\nFascist there's not a far left is there's not an anti fall below in person but not an anarchist the average left or the average Democrat somebody who had done a bunch of Democrats they still believe in fiscal conservatism a lot of them\nAnd just on social stuff they they lean to the left we're not going to run out and try to get rid of this guy on the Supreme Court they're not gonna run out and try to get rid of the president they're going to run out and and in one impeachment and by the way you probably I think you're right you're probably still hear about impeachment for the entire run of this thing because\nThe media although I don't think they they really care one way or the other about Donald Trump another they pretend like they're against them\nThey want impeachment because if you impeach\nThen you've got high ratings let me go to the phone lines Zillow to a jak\nTown you know hey hey you know what you got to have communist is stop stupidity right and I went to the economist says and\nI mean ... ... ... it still it is a you know and\nI Am applauded Democrat sheets that's fallen these idiots these people don't have no a deal or what they know what or how to run a country looked at the last eight years of Obama that show you what they let you all about\nGetting red hats on get it was still a poll\nAnd get help and if the economy get better\nDon't sit there and go with the ban will again why ... ... ... the Democrats using your laptop bad habits come home depot is what they're doing it at that make that motel ramble on them when\nThey did it with around [laughter] I'm okay with their rambled come on if\nAny at all making it bad for a real rape victims victims your daughter's act that daughter and ... out early and go with if something happens much out\nAnd I've got a son and\nMy son I Want to make sure that he just don't get accused and he's able to date in itself\nRight off your feet or wake up and understand what the Democrats could go on to this a try and do we got to put a stop to it on November that sticks with the red wave this will cut off the news you know what's going on but big animal down you know and not knowing you know and I know\nThe Democrats never going to quit it don't matter\nHow I met him in Asia you know Democrats and they're they're not people who were yelling about impeachment majors are confused me to the Democrats who were in charge here saying impeachment do they really think that's going to work\nThey know it ain't gonna work load but they got the media being ... and ... and all this stuff that immigrants don't even know what's going on they they voters most of them don't even know what's going on in the less they look at ABC CBS and they tell it wrong\nAnd CNN and if you're looking at them you know your Austin the shelf will do that or the town they are they getting the right information now today people\nPay for the Democrats genes it all the red wagon because you will prosper and if you move away from them KKK Dumbo rats and I said they rats\nThat you think that would be now let me to Jay All right\nYou just take a breath the demand demand gets excited carry you you get excited\nOr don't mhm you get to know him and I'm just telling you argue bitter much more to come in the Joe ... show\n[noise] they they show called Sharon [noise]\n\nI don't know I don't know so you've worked for this guy and he he named\nYou one of the highest level positions\nIn the administration in the cabinet now that you're leaving hey you run into twenty twenty what because President Trump is already said that he's running twenty twenty he's already said that\nSo I'm not really I'm not clear on exactly what it is and we're talking about here why that would be one of the first question is that she's asked\nNo um I Hope that she stays in public life because again I think that she's\nShe's very good I'm I'm sure that he'll select somebody else another story that won't be a reporter is widely today I think and correct me if I'm wrong maybe you've seen it everywhere but Brett Kavanaugh has committed to make his entire staff women\nI did hear that yeah that's a really good thing you know the left is going to say right white because here's a rapist you wants women around I mean that's a stupid they are and I didn't see that argument yeah\nIt would be it would be ridiculous argument I'm so again I'm a couple of stories that they're gonna make negative Nikki Haley says you can't even work for any more probably going to run against them and twenty twenty which nobody said ever and um and the other one Brett Kavanaugh was hiring women that doesn't seem to matter\nSo when we look at what it is that the left is doing when it comes to cabinet when it comes to Trump when it comes to all of his political wrangling I wanted to break down what the mentality is so to that and we'll have Dr gene allowed in the next hour a little less than an hour from now\nAnd we'll talk to her about that she's got a book out that uh that actually goes right at that topic mad politics keeping your sanity and it will gone crazy will have or event will also have\nAgriculture secretary the USDA secretary I'm Sonny Perdue Sonny Perdue and uh it's it's interesting talking to Sonny Perdue because I'm farmers you're not really sure what to think the left tried as I say oh got badly the farmers are being hurt\nWhen in fact the former seem to still be supporting President Trump we talk about the R fs which many people don't know what that is we also talked about the farm bill we're talking about ... Fifteen which I never heard of before I've heard of ... five\nBut now we're talking about a Fifteen and why that's so important so we do that we also talked about trade between specifically between Mexico and the United states of America and and what that prognosis looks like\nUm I think it looks great of course if you're somebody who's on the left like Robert for instance a Rourke the fourth generation Irish American called himself that though um if you're that guy the only thing you think that somehow Trump is ruining our trade with our friends across the border which of course is not happening\nAll right so we'll take calls and Haley we'll take calls and cabinet and his um his office he's gonna be appointing his assistance will be female or we could talk about the about trade certainly\nBut um for me the lunacy that we saw on Saturday at the Supreme Court where they you know what they were chasing\nRight Harry ... with that same shut it down and\nShut it down the leftist thought they would shut down the Supreme Court\nOf the United states of America and then they weren't scratching and clawing at a doorman of copper mhm maybe I'm missing I ... it looked like great fun maybe I'm missing the fun to be had links to go and act like an ass\nWagon at the Supreme Court\nAnd I don't I don't know if you're going to to assemble and and you know the public nuisance I I Would pick somewhere other than the court you know I just think that it'd be like go to the police station saying hey I'm here to steal something it just it wouldn't make sense to me now because those are the people that could actually make you pay\nFor um for stealing something\nSo again thoughts that Nikki Haley I don't know where we'll hope we hope to have her own certainly we've not had her own yet a former governor of South Carolina you wonder if she goes back home relax for a while maybe thinks about a Senate runner\nOr something like that she's not going to challenge the guy that just they were the job that would be stupid that would be as dumb as if a Hillary ran against Obama in twenty twelve which of course she didn't that doesn't make sense you get a high level job last thing you do is bite the hand that just fed you\nUh eight eight eight nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe packs dot com quick right we're just getting going here want to hear from you on this and we've got much more to come your way on the Joe Petro Steyer\n[noise]\n\n\nTell you that relief factor you know aches and pains can slow you down could stop you from exercising stop you from staying in good shape and can frankly make you feel tired and older you want to do something about it right now and here's what I Want you to do get relief factor give it a try\nI take really factor I think you're going to love it there are three simple facts I Want to remind job number one relief factor is a hundred per cent drug free supplement number two the majority of people who ordered the really quick start with a discounted price of Nineteen Ninety five\nGoing to order more and number three in my opinion less than a dollar a day is worth seeing if you can get out of pain too if you agree get to relieve factor dot com right now again\nGet to release factor dot com it's simple detect simple to use and people are seeing unbelievable results stop dealing with the pain stopped talking about the pain and do something\nLet's say of relief factory can get you out of pain right now going to release factor dot com again best relief factor dot com I Can't think of a good reason but you can't either to not give it a shot right now if you like my family you've got a ton of videotapes I mean VHS she might have film even photos laying around you haven't looked at him and years\nAnd it just be generating they're not going to get any better or nicer or better quality sitting around in a dusty box or on a shelf somewhere wanna get I'm taking care of put together on modern media\nFrom a great company called legacy box I Love legacy box I've dealt with them they're incredible when it comes to saving the history of your family for years to come you can get those photos that film that VHS all that stuff put right\nFor years to come you can get those photos that film that VHS all that stuff put right on a thumb drive you could have it on the cloud you can have it all put on a DVD and then you'll have it to save forever and to share with your family for good sounds amazing doesn't it it is and you got a great deal because listen to my program legacy boxes off remind listeners\nForty percent off a legacy box dot com slash bags that legacy box dot com slash P.

responsible for the illegal arrest tortured and killing or forced disappearance of thousands of people\nPrimarily trade Eunice union is student at students were also are taking away activists and the mass arrest and torture program was called the national reorganization process\nDocuments that were classified during the Argentine civil war show that many dissidents in political server ships\nAre

then of course the death squads were there\nThe death squads created false flag bombings false like shootings they would blame it on terror groups they were using the excuse to change laws\nOr make up laws that didn't exist or make up terror groups that didn't exist\nThey would prop up subversive they would claim that they were members of a radical groups that didn't exist\nAnd then these advanced

culture of fear that was maintained\nIn order to bring the discussion of socialism to the table to bring the idea of globalism to the table\nBack when nine eleven happened we should close our borders we did not do that the borders remained nebulous the best we should have closed down and said look we're not open for business we've been hit we'd been destroyed we've had problems but America didn't

made the wrong attorneys sped away thinking I got to get away with these guys are going to attack me\nHe got out of his car they started beating on his car with the times his car and three thousand dollars worth of damage just because he made a wrong turn on the street and the police just didn't do a damn thing about it then my wife gets hacked my wife gets attacked by a police officer when she

did you see five whites cops weather has a um a such\nIn their stomach all these are staying posture who me that was an unmistakable seem a sonics simple\nOkay this one step further saying when the

else also\nAlso the police units CIA yes we are being trained with Israel\nAnd Israel is very aggressive uses very aggressive perhaps it\nYou'll see that we saw here\nHow aggressive the police are they're they're not the ah like the police of twenty Thirty years ago\nThere there were out there ... all that from you know the knowledge that community as the enemy and I think this is probably uh we sold some some of Israel's a sexy and training got police\nWell we've got a lot of the problem I'm seeing is is when they started with the militarization program where they were ... ... ... rising the police\nAnd and they're doing this in a it just creates an intimidation factor I think and I and I think that was one of the biggest problems there was facing a situation and burgers and was this the first time I think America saw him wraps and other military gear being used to try and grow a riot but it didn't work they just intimidated people even more\nYou know you were mentioning the the perch uh the movie ... which are also are escalating things as buddy in Mexico and many of a lesson constantly ... people are these tools the law into their own hands there's there are people for race\nThere are people out there going communities arrest people for murder rape or whatever they do wait until the police do show up and then they burned alive\nOh I Know I've been reading about all that but the other thing is that you know what do we want vigilante justice in this country\nI mean it's going to end up being that if we don't pay attention to what people want and that's the thing is that you know every ugly horror you can think of can actually generate from this fracturing and is fragmenting of the country\nAnd I don't think people realize just how many people are fighting against each other right now hundreds of sides hundreds of ideologies it's not about tribal divide the Republican versus Democrat we need to be aware that there are many groups right now that are fighting their agendas and getting their agendas hurt and they will do anything to do it\nWell you know that he gave me a dialect that gives working person or George souls and his men stars or rock

buttons and push groups into\nA working to fragment of the country even more disheartened resolve those which should be commended divide and conquer it's it's certainly easier to go to each group and say we can do this we can do this and then finally those groups disbanded they already have their promises made\nAnd it changes the whole scope of what America's about Carlin thank you for the call to the gym in Illinois Hi Jim you're on ground zero\nFor the evening how're you doing I'm doing good\nI I just wanted to make a comment or a and actually a couple of comments a first off I just turned my

about take for granted that are doing what they should be doing but it costs money to maintain those here's\nThe situation of first of all we got an F a bill passed which includes a substantial funding to modernize our air traffic system uh we also passed their seat belt which allows for the deaf quick rolled out of five gee which when you think about San Fran structure particularly right here in a\nIn a district like Seventeen where you've got a large rural or geography or five gee is a great great equalizer between like an Austin or gross back or a a\nYou know my ... and in College Station so we did those now when it comes to the the what most people consider the infrastructure that we did password a bill that took care of ... of uh our waterways and ports and canals and so forth\nThe big thing we're missing though is ... ... what are you doing about roads and bridges are we still have some work to do on that and the biggest single question is the funding\nSo if you remember when President Trump was elected he wanted to talk about a trillion dollar program which would have included about two hundred billion dollars of taxpayer support for these public private partnerships the challenges that Jan Hurricane Harvey and that sucked a punter you know a hundred plus billion dollars and so the question is worth money come from\nSo we've got to look at do you do something like raise the gas tax or some other sort of a user fee\nOr to provide the seed money for funding for the roads and bridges and in in traditional infrastructure and that's where we are struggling right now\nWell if a natural weather event is sucking that drive this morning we're looking at a cat for hurricane is about to hit Florida there's a there's population involved there there's cost involved there ... what happens every right back to the point where that's going to be another hold that we're going to throw money into that was going to go someplace else\nMy suspicion is yes I mean I was somewhere we've got to reassess um how much you socialize the cost of people live on the coast I mean why should we here in the ... valley\nA pay for the economic impact those people that choose to live close to that goes I'm not saying we don't do that I'm just saying we got to have that discussion but\nCongressman isn't that what the insurance industry is all about everybody shares risk it is\nThe challenge is is that you ... you can't buy insurance for those areas ... you have a federal flood insurance program so that the taxpayers wind up on the partially on the hook for the losses\nUm we we've got to start risk adjusting this and having that baked into the if you're going to live on the coast fine live on the coast but there is going to be a cost impact to you because you're going to pay more for when storm or for flood more for all the other related risk that you have\nVersus living here why they should our homeowner's insurance in Nebraska valley be higher because we're subsidizing the folks on the on the coast that's the issue we face\nIn certainly um let's talk about the couple of things happen in Washington let your reaction first of all to a red cut cap and all of getting to see well it was an ugly process\nAnd it's unfortunate because the politics of personal destruction we're in full force and a ... while I'm thrilled that the justice Kavanaugh is now an associate justice of the Supreme Court we've got a lot of repairing to do to try to [noise]\nTo put back to ... that were put into um us as a people in this country or the behavior was a very unfortunate um look something happened to Dr Ford\nAh but the the four witnesses that she had that we're supposed to cooperate testimony didn't ... testimony and so\nYou you have to honor our system of justice you present and the justice Kavanaugh is innocent and\nUh she didn't she didn't do anything to change that so um you know he he is a superb jurist he will be a great person I have on US marine corps but we still have to get past all the damage that that the uh the left imposed on us as a people on us as a nation\nSo what does that mean because um and that will dissipate it it will it'll tamped down to the protests will stop on that but there'll be the next cause that the opposition will have\nMy concern is how it becomes ramped up where does it go from here to continue to hear louder voices more strident voices what's that due to the country well\nI mean I'm not sure of it is going to be tamped down for a while because if you listen to what Hillary Clinton said yesterday she said civility can start until the Democrats are in office well the what that means is that the Democrats and thin and the left intend to continue to be an civil with the uh\nThe attack some Republicans were their verbal attacks are getting in our faces at restaurants or a given the death threats which we've had her you know you saw these ... get shot as a I\nWhich we've had you know you saw these ... get shot so I'm I'm not sure it's tamped down um now that this was passed oh we've got to we've got to come together in American people there is in an op ed in the wall Street Journal on\nA Saturday it was building the connection between these protesters marched in these anti Kevin all protesters as well as anti everything that you've started to see up there over the last several months um that they are paid\nAnd that they are paid in organized by interest of of George Soros is pretty interesting article people aren't going to read it and\nThe other thing uh Nikki Haley yesterday announcing that the end of the year she'd be leaving the UN and basically I heard on both sides of the child support for the job that she had done\nShe has done an awesome job if you look at the relationships we've been able to rebuild with our allies they trust us some of them don't like is too much because we were in the tough love right now if you want us to be a partner with you in protecting your country and then you need to pay your fair share and she's done at our enemies certainly respect us now\nAnd if you if you look at the overall level of what's happening internationally from a security standpoint tensions have gone way down um everybody is behaving better\nExcept for the Chinese but if you look at the Iranians have been less of a problem if you look at the north Koreans if you look in ISIS which is almost as totally wiped out\nA look at Russia Russia is still an issue but they have tamped down or behavior because you had Nikki Haley in the un you have a Michael palm pay was secretary of state and you've got President Trump and what else\nAnything else you want to uh covered the well a couple of\nThings one is I'm pretty uh pretty pleased initially with my first raids of the new NAFTA agreement ah it's it brings the old NAFTA in the twenty first century and I'm I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the Seventeen hundred pages but the conversation I had with stakeholders are pretty happy about it [noise]\nUh and then lastly I'd like to give it another shot out for the Texas Seventeen veterans combination award or if folks here

subject that was brought up during the joined meaning of the brain city council punting zoning commission was a neighborhood integrity here again ... remember John Bush\nIn relation to neighborhood integrity slug sizes we've it's been a coma breakfast for people to come in and buy a lot and re planted in multiple us down to the minimum lot size and\nShould we have certain situations where that's not allowed or are there you know where they're allowed to change to the minimum lot size for the rest of the neighborhoods or hundred foot wide large uh that's something we're going to be exploring any thoughts on that would be appreciated\nResponding to the comments upon ... remember John Bush primary Andrew Nelson\nMy personal view is where you have a long tradition in a neighborhood of a certain look and feel and it's been preserved to date I think those are reasonable\nThings to be looking at where a neighborhood has already clearly not looking very consistent then it's very hard to throw a property right in my view for property rights for us to just pick winners and losers when the neighborhood itself hasn't spoken through history about what the look and feel is uh where\nWhere it is established and there there is a consistent look and feel it seems that that would be beneficial to neighborhoods into the city\nAnother subject being worked on by the Brian planning and zoning commission is tree preservation now something their primary Andrew Nelson had a lot to say about\nLike you guys all no I'm passionate about ...

that was done we'll be Hugh Carey you'll you'll recall that\nThe uh the president said we're going to put tariffs I'm going to be the best terrorists with tears will be tested and that's the best terrorists on all of these terrorists you'd be faking us for how great the tariffs are\nOkay and then I'm a ... all of a sudden you after the left in this country complained like he's a horrible person ever and he's horrible in the worse than horrible person there were the horrible this\nUm all of a sudden you shows up at the White House and says hey great news or to be buying your natural gas and we're going to get rid of the terrorists and we're going to make it more even in more fair because your ears which real\nEither previous presidents wanted a global loose look\nAt economics a

we sort of are the guys who are in the\nYou know on the golden chair here where the people who should be cater to and for some reason we're catering to them so um I talked to to Governor Perry to secretary Perry about exactly that\nWhen when ... short of fried talk was going on when these terrorists were being talked about and bandied about a ... you came to the table so quickly shouldn't be wanted our our liquefied natural gas\nWere you were you consulted Matt\nDoes a president talk to you about that and say hey All right Rick what can we do what can we do what do we have available do we have available plus I talked to him about opening up and war\nNow I I'm friends with people and his staff on on like Facebook and other social media and their travel schedule was nuts we talk about that as well but there are a couple of things that happened today and I'm going to I'm going to bring you this a breather video on television I'll bring you the audio on the radio\nHillary Clinton is now saying why the Democrats had been so uncivil\nAnd she was blaming the Republicans keep in mind\nThese are the people that are dividing conquer these are the people that are separate these are the people that are historically known for segregation Jim Crow separate but equal this is a separating party it always has been there are also responsible for slavery and the KKK and write down on lynchings\nThe Democrats are actually seeing the same things they've always said\nWhich are we must divide and conquer in separate and if that doesn't work we actually see some civility we need to be uncivilized so that we can get that we can get back what it is that we think is ours so let me give you what Hillary Clinton had to say do I think God Chris gentleman poor about being civilized or not\nYou cannot be several ... political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house formed or the family that's when they're ready to start a darn but until then the only thing that the Republican whom to recognize and respect strength\nAnd you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally demeaned the confirmation process uh insulting a on a par not only a ...\nI'm Sorry I had a day to me the ... the confirmation process\nThat was the left that did that with Spartacus grow because and Kamala Harris interrupting it'd be rooted enclosure and lazy and Coons and and\nBlumenthal these people were disgusting and just hearing what is she talking about this is why she's not the president because she she just didn't know what truth she's telling today\nI could afford that women who are speaking out you know what I remember Republican operative shutting down the voting in Florida or in two thousand I remember will slip\nThat actually never happened but actually never happened there were no Republican operatives shutting down voting in Florida the biggest problems were in Palm Beach county Palm Beach county was being run by election supervisor who was a Democrat she's lying because she thinks will believe it\nBoating and John Kerry I remember the things that even the Republican Party did a to John McCain in two thousand I remember\nWhat we were voted pretty good job of getting to vote does she remember denigrating every woman who had a credible claim against her husband meet someone like Paul Jones' paid off to the tune of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars Juanita Broderick has a book out saying Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton is suing her\nI mean\nOr what they did to me for twenty five years ... followed me alive which unfortunately people believe\nWhat was that a lot you know Christian I'm a poor were reporter all the way she thinks she is she would say Well Secretary Clinton what what lies what are they saying about you that was wrong\nTime money and effort on promoting here when you're dealing with an ideological party or driven by the left for power that is funded by corporate interests who want a government that that could be at all it's hot and it can be several but you can't\nOvercome what role important to do unless you win elections\nI've no idea what the hell she's talking about first she said you can't be civil then you can be civil and then she complained that she was wrong to somehow when she wasn't\nIt was actually was was disgusted which she just had to say Chris gentleman poor who is I guess a lefty I don't know she must be for her to sit back and listen to that and not challenge any of what Hillary Clinton just said is pretty disgusting so you can't look at her ever as a um\nAs somebody who is a a true journalist you just can't now add on top of that Eric Holder the former attorney general under Brock Obama his women basically\nEric Holder said today that Michelle said when they go low we go high I say when they go low you pick up\nYour kick a Eric Holder the only\nThe only thing was read Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the far left in this country is that Eric Holder is dumb enough to say it out loud instead of just thinking it believe me all the far left wing progressive idiots think the exact thing that he just said\nThey just don't do enough to say it I guess he is ... that guy thinks he's going to be the president twenty twenty keep that in mind it is a editing nine four one bags editing nine four one Seventy four seven Joe packs dot com it's going to be a line one is John in Houston I John what's going on\nThat and that will uh Joe how you doing today living the dream my friends do you pay for that area you have for people to ask you this\nJoe how you doing today living the dream my friends do you make for that area you have for people to ask you that question owning a ... [laughter] what the the the the topic I wanted to talk about a very actually got me on that it is in a it is the bad about the fracking and the industry the\nOil or that we are capable of producing um I was in the Gulf of Mexico there in the Deepwater Horizon incident wow and all the the crazy stuff all the crazy\nRestrictions and all of that that happened or we actually are rigged moved to Egypt we moved to uh\nUh the Mediterranean just north of Alexandria and or just a few a few days before a Mubarak was overthrown um we docked or more toward\nA off the coast there uh and so I I I got to see first hand and and hear everything that people were saying about block Obama and how great he was because he was the first president and a long time to go over there and say hey we're really sorry for being so tough on you guys\n[noise] excuse me um\nAnd and you're not as bad as we thought we need to give you all more credit and oddly enough that happened to coincide with the\nFracking industry and uh the middle east realizing that America really good sport herself right uh so they they just opened up all the tax uh oil prices crashed you know you know that ...\nThe big deal about what you're going to be I think that fracking will shed would cost you you have to get fifty or fifty five dollars a barrel to make fracking profitable so what they did was they dropped the price so low that it made it ridiculous to frack\nAt fifty or fifty dollars a barrel where you can get it for thirty that's what they were trying to do they're trying to shut down the fracking industry that worked for a while exact but but fracking still does exist that it's actually pick back up again\nYeah you've got you've got a couple of benchmarks fifty five dollars is one of them that's for land drilling a for their land drilling to expand you need to be at about fifty five dollars for offshore drilling to expand you need to be over eighty um\nAnd and that's they knew that and that's what they did a I watched thousands of people lose their jobs not just out in the oil field but all the and celery businesses that are associated with it right\nJust cratered hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs so that you know not to mention the you know a hundred and however many died on the or a a survived the the Deepwater Horizon sixteen that died [noise] but um [noise] it ... it was just amazing that the\nThe whole chain of events that took place a and then of course that also continue to lead on to the Arab Spring and and all the chaos in turmoil and everything else happened over there after that right but ah but yeah that was that was exactly what happened is that when when Saudi\nWhen Saudi and all their neighbors found out that America wanted to be\nTheir friend that we were willing to be told what we can do and what we can't do and we also threatened their oil production well [laughter] what would you do\nYou know I it was out though it was it was about crushing our industry here and Thanks John crushing or industry here and it was about bolstering their industry there because they needed more golden palaces and rock Obama was more than happy to incite the Arab Spring\nBy taking away any support for Mubarak Egypt melted down say good news to military stepped up and stop the Muslim Brotherhood that was taking over the country was going to make it a radical ... Islamic country um and then you know you you're watching in Yemen fall apart you're watching the entire area the tire region\nThrough a lackluster you know ignorance of then President Obama\nOr just melt down and and it it's not okay\nIt made things exponentially worse there it actually allowed for the rise of ISIS by him pulling out you know our troops prematurely and um it in Iraq it just didn't make any sense it didn't make any sense what he was doing other than to say he really did think that that region could sustain itself without us having some sort of a a shake\nAnd he was wrong he was dead wrong but he did it during the election and toward each well and he did for other reasons is really just a tight you know oil industry which makes no sense they employ a lot of people in this country and it eight nine four one package drill pads dot com Rick Perry we comebacks Bayer\nWhen you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries\nWere you surprised at how how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it as these things are outdated you know think about\nAnd here's the other side of it is these things were outdated you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety to run it will side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and\nThink about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are uh are developing a the energy sources that we were buying and\nNow I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions than we were twenty five years ago so makes a button that good sense that the president would say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing\nWe got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh U. S. M. C. A. United States Mexico or Canada trade ... agreement\nMakes total sense for us to have done that we got\nA really not perfect listen uh you know I I don't think I've ever negotiated deal while I was governor or otherwise I Would call perfect but um this president understands how negotiate and negotiations are not\nUm without their challenges but negotiations are generally uncomfortable you uncomfortable for both sides but a President Trump he gets a man I'm so glad he's sitting at the table negotiating for us because America is winning and uh I like when\nIt's all I Do too in the president's and we'll get tired of winning when I'm tired of it yet it is a former governor Rick Perry use the energy secretaries have United States of America you and I've known each other for more than a decade now if you can believe that you've always told me that you believe wholeheartedly that we could export more oil than we import\nAnd people scoffed at that people left to bet you also have said and I think we'll get there that we can be energy independent we're now exporting more than one importing you're not surprised by it\nUm how did you make that happen how do we how do we as a country make that happen\nWell I Want to get the credit to where it's really do and that is to private sector innovators in technologies that are\nThat you know George Mitchell is a great example of the man who is really the father of hydraulic fracturing do a lot of people tell them that wouldn't work wouldn't work and he stayed with it stayed with it or when you couple that with directional drilling and I might add some of that technology of directional drilling that made it possible\nUh and as he's him that they came up at one of our a department of energy national labs\nTo be able to allow the polycarbonate ... material to stay on the drill bit right that has so changed uh and being able to go in and horizontally drill\nA these are formations like the box in up in a north\nDakota a there was never really built if you will uh to drill horizontally but when you can or excuse me a vertical a but when you can go and drill it\nHorizontally it completely changes the world\nAh and and the economic impact is stunning\nAnd I think that's the real story for America\nOur best days are in front of us\nAre the future of the oil and gas industry in America is stunningly power\nOr the jobs that get created the wealth that gets created take a look at the eagle Ford right there and you know south of San Antonio Rick how that changed that entire region you go up to a North Dakota and those communities up there that are just booming\nOr the the limiting factor for them today is having the infrastructure in place that can handle the workers ah it's the welders it's the all of these really high paying jobs are being created in the energy sector all across the country in the Marcellus Shale up in Pennsylvania\nUh and and you want to say adjusted position cross that\nPennsylvania New York line Pennsylvania it's it's forcing up and that oil and gas area where the Marcellus has been done\nCrossed the line into New York or their governor and their their government in Albany has a forbidden them to hydraulic like frack are grown used directional drilling and at the ... you know the economic uh a downturn there is palpable man it's it's it's sad that they don't see\nThat American energy and it was an ... an American energy creating allergy is watching driving down the missions\nThe emissions in America are down fourteen percent since two thousand ... you know these countries that were you know her rang in us about getting out of the Paris Agreement and and my response to them as listen\nWhen you show us that you're reducing your emissions you come and talk to us about signing on to some agreements\nOh I couldn't ... I couldn't agree more me China was given three years before they had to do anything so none of immunity cents each each energy secretary Rick Perry in and you're right I I see what's happening to the eagle Ford I see that it's a boom town I see their jobs there and in North North Dakota and in Pennsylvania\nThat there were zero jobs it was it was ... land um so this is all good one last question are you going to run and I really appreciate you taking the time\nAnd I told you I was gonna bring this up because they're talk to 'em or I think our mutual friend the former vice presidential nominee so appealing to let you go on the program and she's excited as all get out Rick she she says hey we're finally doing the right thing and we're going to explore Anwar um that was something that was that just politics in red tape stopping medical no\nAbsolutely I mean the previous administration didn't like fossil fuels they put the a lot of a country off\nA out of bounds if you will for expiration because they didn't like pasta field they you know they like\nAnd listen I'm I'm a big supporter of renewables as well to lead the nation in the production of wind energy back while we were governor right and and the two thousands and they said and picking one or the other but the previous administration did they picked renewables and that was it\n[laughter] you know fossil fuels nuclear or coal or they they all pay the price with the previous administration Anwar\nAre not only really helps Alaska or with those uh uh revenues that are coming in it is again\nPart of the supply or globally\nWhere we need to keep this supply stable and taking Iran a a oil off the market agree appropriately because of their inability to be\nA citizen of the world the act appropriately uh then you know having an war coming on line you know frankly having the Russians and the and the and the Saudis increasing their production as well all of that is important so that we have a global supply of energy\nAnd ah the United states is leading the charge you think what's happened in the last decade uh we've gone from being totally dependent upon countries that didn't have our best interest to being the number one oil and gas producer in the world the jobs they get created the wealth that gets created\nThat's what the president said he would do when he was a running for office since it's directly what he is doing and um you know I for one look at it and go thank God that uh we got a president that does what he says\nHe's got well I think it's a simple question would you rather have Venezuelan oil or Iranian oil or Alaskan oil and I think that's an easy answer by governor in ... secretary I just think you're doing a masterful job I Love you always take some time with those it is a unity secretary for the United states of America Rick Perry ... billion let's let's not be strangers\nHey Joe let's do it again and God Bless you brother All right we\nRick thanks a billion let's let's not be strangers\nHey yeah let's do it again God Bless your brother All right we're back after this and the joke packed shows that writer\n[noise] ... yeah\n[noise] [noise] Mm\n[noise]\n\nI Love talking about release factoring works for me I Hope it will work for you I kid you not almost everyone over fifty has occasional aches and pains they can have a real negative effect on your entire life right that's why I keep telling you about relief factor there are key ingredients a hundred per cent drug free ingredients\nThat work together to help certain pathways\nIn your body that are associated with pain inflammation have you tried everything you could think of that you can't find a relief\nMaybe it's back neck or hip pain shoulder or need pain even general muscle aches and pains that sometimes keep you from sitting or sleeping or or standing or maybe golfing or playing tennis I'm as busy as I've ever been in the gym and in my career\nAnd entertaining a whole lot of people do right listen to kids you're not really factor is for real or to the really quick start discounted now for only Nineteen Ninety five let's see if they can get you out of that pain to\nRelieve factor dot com relief factor dot com ... that three we could start right now for less than a cup of coffee a day you could get pain relief and to solve that inflammation problem\nIf you're like my family you've got a\nTon of videotapes I mean VHS you might have film even photos laying around you haven't looked at him in years and they're just be generating they're not going to get any better or nicer or better quality sitting around in a dusty box or on a shelf somewhere wanna get I'm taking care of put together on modern media", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "10"}
