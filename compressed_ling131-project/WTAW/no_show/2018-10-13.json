I I like the fact that you're a realist than I Am too it's not all pines guys the little things that can bring you down that you focus on I get that\n... than I Am too it's not all ... guys the little things that can bring you down that you focus on and I get that in from a fan of this game and watching can solve all these years I'll tell you thirty nine to six on paper looks pretty darn good but the game seemed just joined it to me it looked like the the team really\nNever quite got into sink in the office right now is probably a an unexpected concern of yours where like I tell the kids you know we come really the the Wu is the most important thing but then you got to fix the little things and get things done\nYou know I thought we had some wide open guys uh we overthrew that could have put up more points on a board um we did we did a pretty decent job when I went back and watch film in our past protection and things like that\nBut I'm just like you said there are things we got to get better at and then continue to move forward but um you know I thought overall like I said we came away with a W and now we move forward and get ready for an excellent\nNever to question any a decision that coaches make but I got to tell you at some point you got to separate running toward Josh Allison if you're the author is form gum right every time they went that kids direction I'll tell you he is as advertise this year at the end of the film bear bear that out\nWell what I really liked that I've seen out of Josh this year he's taking on double teams getting off of them in line them up in the backfield but the probably the most impressive thing you know he's lost some way but it's all Muslim and now\nAnd he runs sideline to sideline just like linebackers do you know and he does a great job\nJust like one play when they waited a little reverse he sprinted all the way down the field and you know get near the tackles so he's got that mentality doesn't give up and he's flying around that's a great thing for us to talk about one area that I Know that you'd worked on throughout the week but I felt the old gremlin of the snaps not being exactly accurate even though\nYou know came did a great job he was having to go a little bit too far left and right to pull them down\nAnd I love the quote that he had though that said hey part of that is on me that he ... very tight very close and at some point you got to trust that their chemistry is going to kick in and fix that thing will\nNo doubt what we've been doing all this week also we're spending about eight minutes you know during a practice time where she has them one on one snap and each other and that type deal because\nYou know when you face a team that are going to do some blitz is and things like that like we've seen in the past and um you've got to get the ball out in a hurry if it's off one way or the other that throws your quarterback off but I liked the fact that our quarter back because that's one thing always preached to them even if you throw a perfect pass and they drop it you take the blame for it you don't put it on anybody else\nAnd I think that's what he's shown with the center don't worry about will get it fixed and that type deal but those are things that can hurt your down the road you know in in a big game if you have some ... some we definitely got to get fixed\nBut like we tell them you got to be ready we may go out during the ... own coverage when we got to run the football and we'll just see what it is and first couple of series how they're going to play us talk a little bit about the match up with your defense and what they're off into scheme is and what's the one player that you kinda gotta keep an eye on\nWell the thing is I think the one thing they liked to do they're kind of balance so you know they they like to run the ball more than anything no because\nThey did I Do the old school bug sweep and things like that they like to get on the edge and you know they're running backs quick they can get around moved the ball around but I think the big thing is our deep into the line Josh and then we'll tell you they like it when teams and they're going to run the football and that's where we got to get to stop and make them throw the ball more and you know we're working on a lot of different things in the secondary\nBy different ways that they motion and formations and and do some different things and we put in a few wrinkles on that but like we told our guys are just going out communicating in our secondary\nCommunicating up front different things were going to do and and be prepared for it got to think the greatest the greatest victory for defense code talkers and the guys just what you mentioned about they're hoping that they run on him\nIs to put them out of their officers scheme and force them to do something else take away the bread and butter that they've been known for and yes to put up twelve hundred fifty three yards rushing that that's out in front of the rest of the district so they've been able to execute it pretty well\nI think that's got to be the highest compliment to say hey we knock them off their game well there's no doubt you know when you when you look at the stats of course are often says leading the district yeah you know with the most\nYards and everything but it's not in the running game compared to what they do and so\nThat's going to be our challenge to stop the run game because\nYou know team comes in with twelve hundred yards rushing that tells you they believe in what they're doing they're going to run the football and like I said all week long I've seen in our deepest line going with a smile on their face I Hope they think they're going to run out we're going to get out from that's where we got to play this is a truly big game tonight because it does put you in a little bit of a\nDifferent position toward a playoff run you gotta win tonight all mostly you don't tell the kids that\nI Do want to talk about one aspect of the game that I Know it's also been frustrating to you and that is a special teams\nAre we saw a little bit of a leak last week some breakdowns there tell us how that is progressing in your mind I think we're getting a little bit better in\nIt you know down in our kickoff coverage that was our biggest concern you know all year long but I thought we did a lot better job flying down to the football and you know getting our kicks I thought golden bird he did a better job but ball placement and things like that and\nWe've made some changes again this week with a ... chart on her special teams where certain different guys going to be in their own kicked off and the big thing that we've got to work on his on our field goals are extra points and that type deal\nYou know we've got to make sure we hit every one 'cause\nYou know as well as I Know you don't like going in a game known you got to do a to point conversion to get back into the game or things like that and so our guys worked hard and with this weather this week you know we had a five hour weather delay lightning alert\nUm on Tuesday but our guys hung out or we started practices seven o'clock didn't get done 'til nine o'clock and we did a lot of special teams\nWe started practices seven o'clock didn't get done 'til nine o'clock and we did a lot of special teams we work special teams as much this week is we've done ... because that's a phase of game we got to get better at\nIt and finally how how cool weather effect guys attitude\nA they got a smile on her face but I'm sure before long there'll be saying it's too cold out there and there's now they're not dumb remember what it felt like in August but I tell you on Friday after that storm went through it was real nice being out there and I heard a couple of them said can we practice every night at this time this is awesome but like with them you got to be ready for anything in the weather especially in the state of Texas\nYou never know it might be forty degrees more maybe Ninety five degrees Marge has got to be ready to play\nAs a player did you ever complain about being to cold\nOr you know what I I was talking to our

were going wow look how cool these colliding stars are they're going to collide completely you know by twenty twenty two\nOh it's interesting to look at it so then they said well we're going to look into one of the laser enter parameter gravitational wave observatory and we're going to find out just how these\nThings sound right and so they got the sound and this is the sound that got now pay

guess what guys they're coming and it it it sounds like they are it sounds like an armada it's coming our way and they didn't specify what kind of are motivated as well to start school but man these these things are showing movement you know this is the sound they make when they show movement\nSo the good news is that we've got all this stuff you know happening you're aliens yes this is this is a pretty interest I mean if they're saying look every discovery\nEverything that you go out and do now say it has to have some sort of a excellent biological signature to it\nAnd they mentioned look at all the known planets we found the exoplanets and all this stuff well what's really sad about all this saying well we don't have anything available to send out in the space to do this\nAnd they're saying\nYou know we need to be able to find ways to get there because we don't have anything to go after extraterrestrial neighbors or to find them\nIn any solar system and so with all these advances are saying well we need a budget and now says only plan to return to the moon after nearly ... years just got slammed by an internal audit\nMassive space launch system is designed to be the world's most powerful rocket supposed to be able to take astronauts to the moon and Mars and back\nHowever\nIt costs twelve point two billion dollars to develop and launch this rocket first mission and they're saying it's running years behind schedule it faces major cost overruns on Wednesday government auditors published a report highlighting problems with the work of NASA in Boeing they're the biggest contractors for the SOLs\nReport flag sixty four million dollars in extra fees warning by NASA slammed bowling for poor performance and question the long term sustainability the super rocket program\nThe report even calls into question the sustainability of the entire project meaning that even with all the ideas and design but rocket won't even make it off the launch pad to the moon making making this newly manned moon project a pipe dream\nMean auditors put so much blame for the high cost of delays on bowling\nOne of the contractors the company is responsible for about fifty six percent of the new rockets cost but it's years behind schedule and delivering the biggest section of the rocket and I think it's just as you off I mean does this give you more jobs as to whether or not we went to the moon in the first place\nCome on if we're supposed to be on the moon in twenty Fifteen according to George Bush brought rock Obama signing away now we're seeing twenty twenty we got

recording\nA man or the last part really makes me sad because can you imagine I mean like we did it what is the world we came together and actually thought like that again\nIt would be nice wouldn't it but see that's the whole point right the whole point was as I said a couple of nights ago the whole point is to find a reason to unite the planet and you know the moon landing was a time to do that we're in such discord rockets discord according to President Nixon that uh you know it was interesting how\nWe can do something peaceful out in space when we fall into rock has this court or this court on earth and I'm the same things happening now but now all the reports of aliens alien signals all these things are excited about\nThat nobody is hearing them because we're all fighting amongst each other\nAnd that's the says everything we're going to do now has an elite agenda behind it and yeah we don't have the money nor the we have the rockets to go to the moon again or go to Mars or even go anywhere to send anything to find these things we've got Tony Hawkes air\nRight there are a ah we went to the moon said this is ... ... that rocket should have been like a world treasure I I\nDon't find it how you lose the blueprints to it rocket yeah that that was good for humanity it was a rocket to well it was good for the war\nRight it was a safe rocket to better that hydrogen bombs strapped you do or the shuttle to absolutely\nRemember that I was in first grade when they're when they exploded with the teacher that was yeah it was cold and it was it was horrific\nBut challenger challenger exploded in space it was because of a little over ... somebody was made in a place called more than ... call just ah probably sixty miles away from my house\nOr they made it there and because of the cold it broke we'll ringing costs the leak and that thing went up like a hydrogen bomb but the Saturn and I never did all the Saturn five never did it it had more payload then the shuttled it\nAbsolutely and then they're talking about our space teach can't a deal with the right to live there or are you telling me that they walked on the ... to ... and now they can't just take the seeds from the Smithsonian and remake um no\nThey can't\nIt be yeah it all sounds like beer\nI Know it may I mean it just makes you got to be here we are ready for alien contact and according to them we have nothing to go out and meet them with nothing no\nNo and that ... and you know we had a\nSpacecraft that joke Len Bias or what was it a Hawaiian word ... craft yeah yes yeah and that tell you the truth uh how long have we actually been able to like say go out to space and like keep an eye on space\nLong time we've had we've had like what the Kepler of the capital planets being found and gosh all these other things you know it's all and the scientists are there\nHow long has that black Knight satellite been up there oh for thousands of you that that went by and get readings from that satellite\nI'm sure they get 'em all the time\nAnd you know how would we know that it didn't pass by us four hundred years ago or five hundred years ago\nThat's not be able to see it and it's been collecting records from that\nWell did you know and I don't know uh how many times you've heard the show um but there was actually a Pepsi commercial did you ever hear about the Pepsi commercial\nPepsi commercial are acting the black night it was a ten minute commercial for Pepsi and it was supposed to contact the black night\n\nI remember when you did it with a day's Indian or the Australian or do they do yeah yeah yeah I remember that I remember that\nYeah there was actually a commercial it was put out a I think three years ago called black Knight decoded it was a Pepsi commercial for ten minute Pepsi out I don't know when it was played or where it was played\nFor the whole idea was to send a signal to the black Knight satellite a signal a piece and they actually the pick of the night satellite as this\nThis ancient tool to contact the aliens where there was an amazing thing and there was going to why are they doing this what what how how do they know about the black night and and and that's I think\nA lot of things go on that don't make the mainstream news and they're fascinating but the biggest frustration tonight for me was all of this NASA go out there and find stuff but we don't have the money even send a rocket to the moon I mean it doesn't make any sense we\nAre getting ready to us send those people out around the moon you know do you think we're really going to see the pictures from that\nWell I don't even think it's going to happen because I was reading a you're talking about the the Japanese artist is supposed to go up\nYeah yeah yeah and don't even have a rocket and rainy and all they don't have a rocket ready for him yet they don't have anything ready for him he had to go there nothing nothing\nTo say I just I just find it also convenient you know that they can't they they can't do something that people did with the technology of our regular Easter\nIt's amazing isn't it it's mind\nBoggling to twenty eight teams we can be able to get off the ground you eat it you know like ... septic tanks and does it eat all that they feed\nMy thing for the call I'm angry to I'm going by the way\nI cannot play those tones again from

I I came back to the hotel or for the afternoon the general manager was standing out in front very nervous can I talk to you can I talk as well just listen can you give up your room tonight for Madonna and I said okay I said why she uses for starters playing football and she's moved here now\nExactly again and and the by the way I give up\nIt was playing football and through she's moved here now exactly again and and the by the way I give up the room you you get you should I should I should ... sorry ... now that all over the letter of celebrate hey oh no really loves singing [laughter]\nBusiness Portugal ah well no but that was going to tell you more and more people\nCome here to visit and then they decide to buy a house to invest to work\nAnd to study we have more and more international students coming to Portugal more and more American X. box ... and and you know that we were just elected by international expect\nAs the best country to live and this is quite the way I Would say at trial\nWill my mature in terms of either living in a place or visiting a place is why wouldn't you want to go to a place with a high standard of living in a lower cost of living and right now about what you have\nWe have I Would say that a very good quality for for for for money\nUh we are and we have we've had a huge investments in the last ten years I Would say in terms of hotel so we have to give you an example in the last two years ... around one hundreds new hotels opened in Portugal\nAnd very different and I think that's what the making of a million miles we have a mix and people are finding a unique experience he's you know we're unique ... for example you have oh tells in the middle of the village\nA downtown in the north of Portugal or where you can for example go for a ride\nAnd you can cross a door to reverse ... river delta and combined for example a walking ... we had some vineyard experience and can you imagine a looking at the sunset overlooking the river are overlooking the ocean drinking\nA great loss of wines\nWe're hearing you mentioned food forty years ago you did not show in the food chain forty years ago it was basically great seafood but that's what it was today how many Michelin star restaurants are here and there's been alone we\nIn the country we have more than the ... almost two thirty\nIn the country ... and ... chefs which are great\nMany of them came from our ... in schools in the last ten years which is amazing these here we we have in the ... gala in Portugal for the first time recognizing these boom that he'd take happening in our front of me and this year also we we had our one of our most important chats\nNamed the best chefs in the world and so you can imagine we are getting more and more well known for this and also again because our chefs as reinvented our traditional products\nWe always used to say that we had the best fish the best real fish in the world and even for this hour chefs at reinvented the flavor of our fish but very very how could I say we have a very a taste of see\nYou can't taste the see when you eat ... fish which is amazing and a very sophisticated what do you have any ... is that\nOur traditional and generally authenticity\nIs also becoming very sophisticated and innovative in an innovative but that's what people are fighting here we have some for example one of the Pritzker ... architecture prize is winning the vast ... prizes for our some museums we are in front of one ... right now you're in front of the river\nBut it also at the same time maintaining tradition authenticity and also I Would say what is the best care at to characteristic of the Portuguese people which is of pathology we love\nBeing with people welcoming people opening doors again we've also worth the law in guaranteeing\nThat there is African activity so that people reach Portugal in a fast way and from the U.S this is I Would say the best to the first of all we are the closest country to the U.S of the European the closer to European country and we doubled our air capacity in two years\nIn the old days Americans discovered fortunate because you were reviewing stop the planes couldn't get any further and they used to stop on the age or\nYou know that we even have a program called a stopover in Portugal if you don't you go out as a cool program what's up exactly that was a program that was amazing because if you can go to anyone anywhere in Europe or Asia\nOr or the ... Israeli may imagine you can make a stop over to Israel you can read the or up to five days and don't pay more for that\nAnd this is also helping a lot to show for it to go to people that had never thought of coming to your book unfortunately by surprise ... no no and I think that's the next time they will only come to Portugal because they will live in love with this country that they will keep the other ones it's too bad you have no enthusiasm for your country\nI'm I'm a passion for a microphone tree but I think I have a reason for that don't you agree Peter\nOut of sorts through his reports would buy so much for thank\nYou and I ...

finally arrived in this and he said well I think I Am so glad to hear\nWell let's talk about that because one if you go back ten years ago losing wasn't really on the radar that's right what changed\nI think what happened was people are just getting more and more concerned we just had financial news on in the hotel that we were staying in and\nAnd I think people are concerned about their

still a bargain here\nDefinitely yeah and it depends on what kind of water front talking about\nLet's face it the the country of Portugal is to uh one half boarded by Spain one half by the Atlantic

front of this showdown friend of mine going back to the days of the world travel and tourism councils origins I mean the ... the beginning of it up the former head of Air France in the U.S and the\nFormer head of the WTC unquote bum bum gotten how are you sir good morning to\nWhat we're talking about these days what's topic a is over tourism uh we you know we could even talk about here in Portugal but we're talking about all the examples if every country now at least addressing it may not be addressing it in a in a a an a helpful way but at least they're talking about it\nOr you know in Venice for talking about putting turnstiles and St Mark's square in Barcelona has made it and that's what they don't want to become the next Venice\nBermuda limiting the number of cruise ships to come in the harbor at any one time Florence of all places passing a law basically saying it's illegal for you to eat outside on the streets meaning not a restaurant but while you're walking I mean it's getting a little crazy and yet what are people really doing about it because it's a double edged sword\nYou would be the first person to tell me and by the way you were the first person to tell me about the power economically of travel and tourism\nAbout GDP about job creation about resources and tax base and incoming revenue and foreign exchange and all the things that surround the economic engine that are being driven by travel and tourism but at the same time you take an economy\nLike the ... the destinations I just mentioned that her show fueled by traveled tourism now trying to control the very thing\nThat that basically makes them economically it's a problem\nBut it is definitely you remember Peter when in the old times we're trying to convince government leaders about the importance of trauma centers and right\nNow ironically tourists who is overwhelming everybody and let's just get some fears\nChina one point three billion people in a one point two billion people in Africa eight hundred and Seventy five million people if those countries reached delivery of the ... of the U.S or Europe\nCan you imagine it's looked over two weeks it's overwhelming to us so we have to do something\nWell the thing is you the number that gets me just in China alone a hundred and thirty million Chinese traveling this year alone and you know you go to Venice and I use it as an example the beginning of the show you go to Venice and you look out and what do you see\nYou know it's not the British size it's the British thighs I mean everybody crowded on the on that bridge with their selfies and it's it's got to the point where Venice is no longer a genuine experience\nAbsurdity but that's that's one of the points we have or does not get afraid by that we have two hands with this issue\nAnd these issues can only be ... if governments\nAnd the private sector like I did in all the good old timers WTC joined forces what can be done we cannot meet at a couple of bridges like different there's only one it's unique in the word so what can be done is eight\nTo diversify ... nations many places in the word Justine in many countries into was who would be happy to have tourists coming and had it being done to stop the down economy\nThey ah we have to also to ... to widen the seasons\nEverybody leaves at one time into a into into a year now we have to diversify the departure\nI Am the biggest fan for all sorts of other reasons about the idea of the season ... should no longer exist exact um you know it's interesting you take a look\nAt airfares ... and you come from a history of the airlines are you know you always ... recognize that oh the airfares are going to start going down at the end of August they'll announce the sales kicking in in early September\nThat's no longer the case airfares have been on sale all year long because of the way that people are now beginning to travel or not travel\nYou know you you have a situation where so many people overseas are proceeding in the U.S as being in a hospital on welcoming and closed that the number of foreigners traveling to the u._s. was dropped between nine and eleven percent\nWhen that happens ... would have been their return tickets home now become empty and become an hour out down tickets there guess what everything's on sale at the last supply and demand you can get airfare sales that started in January an end in December they don't just start in October\nSo that's I guess a good thing for over tourism because you could spread it out a suit\nThat's I guess the good thing for over tourism because you could spread it out to\nBe two planes or food what we have to do is to lean back all of us and face that ... a ...\nWe have to re think the polls how we ... the ... passengers\nSeamless everybody talks about it but nobody does that you see when you go to a kitty when you go to batteries when you go to whoever you have to hew ours too fast immigration\nLook here's the guys in Eighteen almost two thousand Nineteen and we're still standing into our lines it makes no sense\nOf ... and you have facial recognition is you have all those technology that exists\nYou know we were trying to make governments aware of all the forms of travelling to reason now we have to make comments about the love of tourism and how to handle the then\nThat's deep practical approach the are equipped equipment approach if I may say so yeah but then you have a ... so how do you make your destination to\nA discovery\nInstead of having hundreds of people jumping over the bridge you talked about in Venice yeah and throwing papers into the canals by the way of course so you know we have to completely ... way to look at the sea\nOf course it sounds good but you have an economic ... impact here you can't turn people around that quickly if it's their major source of income\nYeah but but it will remain a major source of income but they have to spread it out if you spread the seasons and it will become a fantastic new income for out of this in Asia yet places in the world you have been traveling I have been traveling yeah places we are still virgin\nAnd people want to come to the needs\nOf the motivation of the travel has changed so\nYou want peace you won by ...\nYou want authenticity you know all those things can be popped off of work promotion and all those international organization including my former organization WTC W O United Nations you name it they have to change the way they think\nThey have to sync no I'm not no\nOf course my smart money is on North Korea and Saudi Arabia because Saudi Arabia is now issuing tourism business has never done it before ... and if you take a look at the economic structure of North Korea the only thing that will save them is traveling to us and said look it's not even negotiable that's it and don't think that little Kim was not thinking about that right now\nI I'm sure it does yes I don't think that your president does by\nWell that's another story considering the fact that he's also a hotel or he should know better but the bottom line is it's an economic reality that's what's going to say though it's no different than the ping pong diplomacy of a Chinese back in Nineteen Seventy ... and\nJohn ... from formerly of the WTC but here for the WTC meeting and always a wealth of information thank you so

you know I've always said this just email me to Peter Peter Greenberg dot com with your name phone number questioner problem\nWe'll solve it right here in the air in fact let's do that right now here's an email from Steve Benson who writes for several years I have a case in the grand Cayman islands of for this coming year my flight causes increased over two hundred dollars you mentioned your son United\nIs this is not a surcharge or surcharge because they rebuilding the airport or both or it's because I'm trying to go too far out from my departure date in February of two thousand Nineteen\nAny hope will be appreciated here's the answer it's all the above plus one it gets down to frequency and capacity so let's talk about this you'll see that airfares right now to certain places in the Caribbean including by the way not just the Cayman Islands but even St Lucia are much more expensive uh airlines have now re allocated their assets\nIn many cases and the Caribbean gets basically beaten up because of it because they feel they could make more money uh in what they don't perceive as leisure markets where they can feel the plane in the business in first class actions\nAt a much higher premium so as a result of the back of the bus fares have gone up because the capacity has gone down by the way it's across the board it's not just United it's American it's even Jet Blue I was in St Lucia not too long ago the coach airfare from New York to St Lucia\nRound trip hold on now fashionable seatbelts sixteen hundred dollars per person you can basically by on around the world ticket for that so some of these airfares are essentially pricing some of these destinations out of the market entirely but\nThere is the other part of the question that us and that is are you looking too soon and the answers you are the real sweet spot for booking is anywhere from forty five fifty four days out of your intend to David departure\nOr the airlines follow certain algorithms\nAnd computer modeling that lets them know you mentioned February of two thousand Nineteen well let's pick a date February forth well they know how many people through last February for and the year before on February fourth and the year before that and because of all that they're able to reject would they think\nIs how many people are gonna be flying this coming February for it and they price it way ahead of time\nWell here's why that forty five fifty four days sweet spot kicks in because forty to fifty four days out at the computer model doesn't hold up if that projected number doesn't hold up well then guess what\nThe number is ... is basically applied\nFigure it out and those prices come down and it's the law supply and demand so\nFigure out forty to fifty four days out from your February of two thousand Nineteen the desire departure date and then that's when you want to go on line at least do some comparison shopping no guarantees of course because of what I told you about about capacity but at least it gives you a better fighting chance of what you're able to do\nHere's one from Alan ... who writes how safe is it you get a visa and do St Petersburg and Moscow on our own well you pick two very different places in Russia a or the Russian visa is interesting because ... and the old days you'd ... you'd needed to basically have a litter of invitation\nFrom a company or if you weren't going to an organized tour operator and then the crazy part of the Russian visa if you have to lift every place you've ever traveled in the world and your entire life\nYou can imagine how long it took me to fill out the form but the good news is are doing better to shrink\nYou can imagine how long it took me to fill out the form but the good news is they are doing better than issuing visas thanks to the world cup uh they really had to get their act together literally to process all the people who wanted to go to Moscow for that\nSo it's getting easier to get the visa and easier for you to navigate these two cities on your own without it being an organized tour package especially in St Petersburg uh but the one ... there is\nA the the arbitrage a you want to get there like at seven in the morning you want to get there early because of the line starts forming\nAnd especially during the summer season when the cruise ship turns out so the best thing you want to do is do not go there during the summer dress warmly\nAnd go out of season and you won't get stuck with a longer lines plus the cruise lines tend to monopolize the absolute number of people I can actually go to the ... any one day especially when you have three or four ships in town on the same day\nOf season you can do it a Moscow same deal\nJune July and August stay away from the place it's way too crowded and yes you can do it on your own just take enough time in advance to get the visa and fill out the form of telling it's going to take you a little bit of time it's not like you know twenty seconds and you feel it inside it out it's a little bit longer than that so long as you know that\nYou're in good shape here's one from Karen O'Grady\nWho uh who writes is Acapulco safe to

call and get you ready to go on the air with me eight eight eight to five six ten eighty let's talk gardening right now let's fill up this phone lines please eight eight eight to five six ten eighty\nAs we are as we\nHead into a the the second half of all of them one of the things that I Want to suggest to you is keep a close eye we've had a lot of rain across Texas this fall most parts of the state and that has brought on an onset of broadly weeds\nChances are you didn't get gallery put out the first week of September and so you may be seeing a lot of clover and dandy line Zach Sallis plant tan and other broadly weeds and if you are some time in the next four weeks or so\nI Would be a good time to apply broadly to weed killer spray this is going to be a product containing too for the the numbers to and then a coma for an a hyphen and Diaz and dandy line to for the\nUh there are other active ingredients in some of the product said try make is a is a blend of three\nA broadly weed killers I'm find either way but with try and make you have to be a lot more careful because it does have those other two products are active in the soil they can soak into the soil and be taken up through the root systems of trees and shrubs\nAnd then the third thing goes back to what I started with an atheist when you water water deeply and then let it get a little bit dry before you water again you you don't want to\nWater a little bit every day that's usually when you get the shell roots right near the surface so somewhere in there I'll bet is is what you need to help you but I'm not sure exactly which one of those is the biggest help\nOkay I think it is\nAlmost almost any well almost in the nursery or hardware store\nOr most feeds tourists will habit if you tell them I'm looking for a really good landscape fertilizer\nAnd you tell them you want to an all nitrogen fertilizer I I really don't want to get highly technical on it but\nThere's an old type of fertilizer this very inexpensive and a lot of people think that's what I'm Talking about it is not that's ammonium sulfate is Twenty one zero zero and that is not good for ... all fast release nitrogen that would be like uh if I suddenly started to\nUh exist totally on soft drinks sugared soft drinks that with my only nutrition I wouldn't last very long and uh that's that's what that would amount to and giving to your lawn so what you want is a high quality fertilizer has a little bit of that kind of nitrogen\nBut also has a time to release slow release form of nitrogen in it to a good fertilizer a person a good salesperson I Will know what I'm Talking about and they'll know when you ask a what I Want a fertilizer that has a lot of slow release nitrogen\nAnd you know what they'll do they'll turn that bag over and they'll start pointing at the tiny print Hitler\nYou'll you'll say oh my gosh Neal has sent me back to college you're back to the high school to to learn about fertilizer analysis and you'll\nYou'll think of a tortured you or something [laughter] but but that's what you need and and that same fertilizer will work for all your shrubs and trees and actually for your flowers and

moles or something of that sort of um you know what I'm what I'm going to do is I think the best thing I can do is send you to a nursery\nThis fairly close to you you have all kinds of soil in ... county\nAnd uh so that's what I Want you to go to a nursery or\nA really good hardware store and not a national chain store but but some place where you can talk to a local gardening expert and if you have photographs of any of the damage not a not a missing plant there used to be a plant here that's what I'm Talking about\nBut if there are mountains or tunnels or anything that you can photograph and take in um they will know what's going on in your area\nOr and they can help you better than than I can without seeing it it's not going to be ground hogs um\nIt uh\nIt it would be go further moles or something of that so that would be what I Would imagine\nIt will do that\nYeah you're going to find out what the the farm it is and then there will be the the the proper\nUh the proper control I have a long description on my Web site at Neal spirit dot com or in the frequently asked questions of gophers and moles and how to tell which you have and\nAnd how to control them but I I
