R. C. dot org Tony Perkins after the uh the bottom of the our ability to go to the phones and say hello and welcome to ah Martha in San Antonio Martha what's going on\nHello Joe a little more of a\nI'm a high I just wanted to tell you that I think it's kind of a good thing that Dianne Feinstein held onto that letter for six weeks 'cause I mean when we have heard more stupidity environments from the left and and one more thing\nUh for the first time ever I'm sixty two years old and I'm going to register tomorrow to vote to great my husband is too for the first time ever [laughter]\nWow isn't that what we do this process motivate you guys to go and do that\nYes sir um we've never really been into politics but when I watched a Donald Trump come down the stairs and he said that he was going to be the best president ever I wanted to believe him and my heart believed him and now I Know it's true now I Know it's\nI think there are a lot of people like you I think there are a lot of people like you and your husband who probably haven't set it out loud vague you Martha appreciate your calling in um a lot of people like you were probably going to go into the same thing to go and register to vote going to go and vote going to go and get this done going to go and take part of the process I think it's the right thing to do\nThe right thing to do anything to her a lot of people who won't call radio show would say so by the way I I disagree on her releasing an earlier would've cause even more a rambling and rank or I disagree I think ... re released early on\nI think that the end result would have been we would have had the investigation sooner but if you have any investigation sooner he would have been confirmed a lot sooner or if you would've been on the court for several weeks now I'm\nFeinstein settlement letter for a simple reason she must not have believed it\nShe must not have believed it sound like she had an independent investigation going on she sat on it because you didn't think he was going to get be able to get pass the committee\nAnd I don't know but she believe that the allegations were strong enough\nOnce she knew she needed it that's when she went to it and she completely a release the the privacy of Dr Ford when Dr Ford want to stay anonymous very very strange other opening unfolded\nAge I ate at eight nine for one pack eight eight eight nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe packs dot com we come back we'll be Tony Perkins use the president of the family Research Council go to ... dot org or I go and make that happen also will have plenty of time for your phone calls on the program\nIt's Joe ... show we're going right back [noise]\nYou do not reach consent consensus and there's division in the culture I've never seen it more intense than it is right now and until the court moved back to its proper boundaries and the elected representatives shape the policies for this country it will continue\nIts Tony Perkins the president of the family Research Council seat on Oregon you bring up some ... some very important point I'll add marriage to what I should little while ago about what was it in the\nConstitution 'cause it's not in there to the states should not solving these things I'm having said that what about the politics of personal destruction they will take a person that they ... they absolutely do anything to on the merits as Kavanaugh said you can't you couldn't beat me on the merits suddenly a letter that you had for two months showed up\nYou couldn't beat me on the merits suddenly I'm just horrible guy I'm evil according to one you've got one guy saying that he Spartacus you got the other people you know interrupting Grassley Everytime he spoke\nYou is this the overplay their hand these people are really start to see the ... the winding down of the politics of personal destruction when you're going after somebody you just don't like politically [noise] I\nI Wish the answer to that was yes that it's it's going to begin decreasing whereas I can see that because they saw that it didn't work I I Wish that were the case I don't think it is I I think what what what's happening here Joe is that we're seeing the left throw a tantrum\nBecause they're they're accustomed to Republicans\nFolding when the operation gets intense when they fire those first rounds of those personal destructive grounds that they fire they find the Republicans\nI mean why did they go after the whole you know a ... alleging that he was a gang rape is that he you know attacks sexually attacked people because look conservatives we care about those things are important as we don't want we don't want that type of stuff elevated in our society in fact we think it has no place in our society\nSo they think that they're going to make him radioactive by by accusing him of that and then everybody is just going to run from him well it's a new day because we've seen\nThat that card played over and over and over again in what's happening now is at the same cultural elite that we're attacking him the media and others playing into that well they're the same people\nWho are attacking the values that conservatives across this country hold so dear right\nSame reason that they attacked President Trump\nThat's why I think President Trump support is so solid among conservatives is because it's the same people that have been attacking conservatives for the last four decades that are now attacking the president and all of his nominees so I think we're in a new day I think Republicans have finally gotten the backbone conservatives are saying you know what\nIf we want to keep this republic we have to fight for it and that means we have to stand up to the personal attacks and yeah we're going to have to take some uh some ugly hits but you know what\nWe're not going to we're not going to capitulate we're not running up a white flag in fact we don't own any white flags\nAnymore we're gonna have charging right what what this president I think you're right I think the white flags were put away if not if not thrown out\nWith a different president do you think they would have folded because politically speaking it would have made sure yeah for the guy who nominated him to say I rescinded nomination with another president would have been a very quick for Kavanaugh to shape our resumes you know I don't accept the nomination because of these things I'm a distraction we always do that with our site I don't want to be a distraction\nSomebody to get out of the way was it the backbone of my parents at a yes\nNo question you know 'cause it's a new day you know I mean look courage brains courage and I don't agree with everything this president has said and done his lifetime right but I Do agree with his leadership today America when when we were going into this election and twenty sixteen many of us saw\nFor what it was our republic was hanging by a thread over a raging fire right and we had Donald Trump who said you know what I'm going to give it my best shot to save it and we said [laughter]\nI don't know but we don't have an option and we're going with you and and look what he's done he's done exactly what he said he was going to do he's fighting and people are tired of being pushed around being marginalized by the left now that doesn't mean let me be very clear Joe\nWe understand as Christians I'm going to speak to this from a Christian sample injured I run a Christian ministry right and that's the way we look at these things\nThese are the Democrats are not our enemy the the the ... on our enemy we don't have those people all we love those people but we love 'em enough to speak truth because we know that what America has to offer will only continue if we have a solid moral foundation\nAnd so we're going to work to preserve that foundation and we're going to work to strengthen America Again so that it can be a nation that not only allows people here in this country to prosper but when America is strong the world is more stable America has a leading role to play and for the first time\nIn a long time\nWe have an administration that understands that\nAre in a minute or so we have left with Tony Perkins ... it'd be a foresee a president it's the family Research Council good at first she ordered\nLet me ask you must have been germs going about a month or so do a month and a half two months ago the house was certainly going blue is going to be a blue wave of the Senate probably ... to as it sits today if we stay motivated energized I think the Senate probably picks up two or three Republican seats and the house or as now up for grabs\nIt in the overplay their hand but I asked about a little while ago by the left do you think that it it's it's a week and a lot of people who are center center center right right right\nBy the left do you think that it it's it's a wake and a lot of people who were center center center right right right maybe even conservative who sat on their hands and said I Can't vote for a Trump is going to make them go to vote in November Tony less than a month from now we're going to find out who gets to the house and Senate are they re energized will you see now this blue wave go way\nUm I I I think your analysis correct I think we see maybe two or three seats picked up in the Senate I think the houses a toss up ... the difference I see though is that I think there were people who were Trump very supportive of Trump not supportive of a Congress that they don't think has done a whole lot to\n\n... to have at least a Republican Congress to and to watch his back while he does the majority of the work so I think they're motivated to go vote because of what this president has accomplished\nThe Indian food you agree with me that's because the left will stop at nothing to basically went up\nTo lower absolutely they they look I think what was on display in the last three weeks is how desperate the left is and to keep the lemurs of government and they want to do it through the courts and they know that intuitively if there's this much opposition this president this administration must be doing something right regardless of what the mania says\nWe always appreciate the time it's Tony Perkins president of the family Research Council F.

one Seventy four seven glad to have your long for the ride fake slot for stopping by\nFor those of you are listening to the live stream I guess you were hearing I'm Kerry twice a year you had nice ... you actually had a button you can even realize it for a while\nA man that kinda stinks unless you're dead but\nYeah so you have a new it's gone now out of it I was actually give them two sources so I was given them you twice and there were a little bit off to a sounded like an echo so that's actually kind of cool okay so there you go see your voice is sounding awfully chocolate he has a new studio have you on your\nIdea on a very very than the around here\nIt'll take a little getting used to examine the process and use is a little different maybe a little bit closer to the Mike than usual but either way you sound you're amazing so\nJust so you could tell you what a different place ... okay and I'm just saying oh good good All right it is a ... and eight nine for one pack so uh the ... do you have a nuts and bolts of what happened this weekend or do we even need it anymore but it happened Saturday\nWell yeah I Do have I mean the latest is even like it and the Democrats are planning to do now\nAnd let's let's do it okay uh this is from Fox News the narrow confirmation him now justice Brett Kavanaugh the weekend marketing major political victory for President Trump and the beginning of a new battle for Democrats who are now shipping their message to threaten possible impeachment against the newest tank or justice and question the legitimacy and the Supreme Court itself\nAfter grueling confirmation fight than including graphic sexual misconduct allegations which the nominee denied Kavanaugh is confirmed Saturday on Fifteen at forty eight mode and ceremonial swearing and will be held Monday evening\nAnd that and he joins the court replacing retired Justice Anthony Kennedy prominent Democrats single the fight over a seat and the court itself will extend will be on next month's midterms\nNow they went to impeach him it's an insult to the American public Trump said Monday still feeling over the confirmation process and predicting Republican candidates and only benefit and the controversy in the midterms Democrats they'll maintain the fines energizing their Corleone nonstop marching we will not stop fighting DNC chairman Tom ... statement\nOver the weekend former attorney general Eric Holder said the courts legitimacy should be brought into question with the addition of Canada\nSo they're actually talking to an impeachment right All right so let's break that down who gets to impeach which body the house or the Senate and the Senate and house to house gets to bring\nAppeasement the Senate would say guilty or innocent or guilty or not guilty\nSo the Senate would actually hear the the trial but the house has to call for impeachment so I mean it's stupid it's a waste of time it's political wrangling it's dumb it's backward it's a disingenuous it's ignorant it's on and tell it could just keep going good\n\n... the house right now cannot teach anybody because the Republican or I guess they could if they're if they chose to do it before they won't\nThe Republicans while I guess they could if there were if they chose to do it before they won't Republicans in the house or in support of Brett Kavanaugh\nGood and um I mean\nThere's there will be no impeachment unless the house goes to the Democrats in November ... here's the weird part for me the Democrats aren't smart enough to know I mean I don't think they're dumb generally speaking but this is a dumb move\n'em [noise]\nThey don't appear smart enough to know that the Republican and conservative base doesn't want Brett Kavanaugh impeached\nAnd we don't want Donald Trump impeached just saying that he's going to be impeached use ridiculous that can only happen if they win the house they're actually hurting their chances of winning the house so\nHere I Am six six didn't want to have those any other do I want them to keep saying that they're going to impeach so that more Republicans and conservatives go and vote or don't want him to stop saying it because it's so stupid I don't know I I actually don't have a good answer for myself\nWhen I asked myself that question so what do I want oh I Love mcgary I'm going to answer answer\nBut that's really where we are right I mean that that's really truly where we are we're at a place where either the house does it real or the Democrats don't realize that they can and peace deal is they they have the majority and they don't not neither house in the mouse from the Senate\nUm and they're actually telling voters vote for us will raise your taxes we will send jobs away will make the unemployment rate go well we'll try to get a Medicare for all the tune of thirty two trillion dollars something we could never do\nOr we're going to impeach the president impeach the ... the Supreme Court justice that was just plays ... think that's a winning combination they actually think let's let's abolish ice let's open the border they think this is a winning combination so I guess I kind of want him to keep yet but [laughter] I kind of want them to keep on talking\nKeep on saying stupid stuff and at the end of the day where you're going to have you use a or a Republican majority in both the house and Senate and then my game and both the house and Senate so I guess I'm leaning towards ... saying it I don't know I guess that's that's what I Want I I Would guess\nNow I think they're going to stop anytime soon either so\nI guess I just don't understand why they think democratic voters are going to be somehow empowered to go to the polls the typical Democrats a center left leaning person who's not a\nFascist there's not a far left is is not an anti fall below in person but not an anarchist the average left or the average Democrat somebody who identifies as Democrats they still believe in fiscal conservatism a lot of them\nAnd just on social stuff they lean to the left they're not going to run out and trying to get rid of this guy on the Supreme Court and going to run out and trying to get rid of the president they're going to run out and and in one impeachment and by the way you probably I think you're right you'd probably still hear about impeachment for the entire run of this thing because\nThe media although I don't think they they really care one way or the other about Donald Trump another they pretend like they're against them\nThey want impeachment because if you impeach\nThen you've got high ratings let me go to the phone lines are similar to a jak\nTown you know hey hey you know what you got to have communist is stop stupidity right and I would say on this\nThis and I mean ... ... ... is a you know and I I don't know applauded Democrat sheets that's fallen these idiots these people don't\nHave no a deal or what they know what or how to run a country look at the last eight years of Obama that shared show what they let you all about\nGet red hats on get it let's go to a pro and get help and if the economy get better\nDon't sit there and go with the ban will again why ... ... ... Democrats using your bad habits come home depot is what they did it and make that motel ramble on them when\nThey get away with around [laughter] I'm okay with their rambled come on if any at\nAll making it bad but a real rape victims victims your daughters I got a daughter and ... out early and go with if something happens much out and I got a son\nAnd my son I Want to make sure that he just don't get accused and he's able to date itself right all your people wake up and understand what the Democrats don't want to discourage are trying to do we got to put a stop to it on November that sticks with the red wave\nThis will cut off but can you is you know what's going on but they are mowed down you know and not knowing you know and I know the Democrats that we're going to quit it do not have\nGiven a J you know Democrats in there they're not people who were yelling about impeachment they just they're confused me to do the Democrats who were in charge here saying impeachment did they really think that's going to work\nThey know it ain't gonna work load girl but they got the media being ... and all this stuff that immigrants don't even know what's going on they they voters most of them don't even know what's going on in the less they look at ABC CBS and they sell it in the wrong\nAnd CNN and if you're looking at them you know your Austin the shelf will do that or do they not getting the right information out today people\nPay for the Democrats genes\n... on the red wagon because you will prosper\nAnd if you move away from them\nKKK dealt with Iraq and I said they rats love you and let me now to Jay alright\nIt just just take a breath the demand demand gets excited carry you you get excited\nYou guys are no mhm you get to know him and I'm just telling you argue bitter much more to come on the job at show\n[noise] they they show called Sharon [noise]\n\nWhat exactly is that you think he did since he won their vote for election that makes them now want him to be impeached and and the answer is nothing you're just dumb so again I guess I think I Want\nThe impeachment talked to continue because I think people who are rational logical thinking people will say well that's dumb I'm going to vote for that\nLet me go back and say Hi to our daily lives in Michigan Hi Dave what's going on\nRight now I just want to thank you for starting up and so today we sat\nDown You're welcome you're walking the all star\nGame from Battle Creek Michigan or their original Benton Harbor but work\nWhen I did not know they were from Battle Creek I mean I obviously there are no town but I didn't notice from Battle Creek\nIn fact the drummer worked for Twenty years or so or or who I guess some\nBlew my mind when I was watching the hearings with with ah the doctor for\nThat and they use in a question to hear the word exculpatory\nRuthless woman that has a bachelors degree to masters degree in government for more than one doctor but anyway she said I don't know what the meaning of that how there was a hidden that they're seeing that in ... ...\nWhat what was she knows the meeting and how could she also not really know what it means to you know to ask how long was the polygraph she also didn't really know what it meant asking who's who's going to pay for the public before the polygraph she didn't know ... who was paying her lawyers and when\nI mean she gave a lot of answers when she said a lot of I don't knows because if you say I don't know you probably will get away with it\nUm but I mean we're finding out now about people contacting her friend and and trying to pressuring the change in your testimony the whole thing stinks and it really makes the Democratic party look horrible it really does it make similar to absolutely stupid\nAnd ah you know I'm okay with that I'm okay with the looking stupid open line now at a editing nine for one pack editing nine four one Seventy four seven\n... dot com back out it's going to Chuck in San Antonio Chuck what's going on\nI go right show at Antonio so that you know you're right that most Democrat or other down the metal but I worry because the correct that last socialist leadership\nIs using tactics that we're seeing is three think all of a thing as a better\nWay or you know what it used to kind of dialogue you or anybody who is opposition you ban religion you get anybody educational you don't allow them\nAnd that is exactly what that was socialist leadership and I wonder if the average Democrat really dangerous to our nation I think they will try to get a day and age but I think they will try to continue to oppose anything\nJust because they shut down and anybody that\nI I I agree I agree with your\n... thanks for the call man I I agree with you there trying to shut down anybody who disagrees with them and at the same time they're trying to say that he's shutting them down like I watched the rally was it last night or Saturday where he was in Kansas and he's just he's risen carry he was worth it it was it was a ... that Donald Trump show\nAnd he's up there he just riveted he's pointing to people that he's doing this will be doing that and he's doing it just really just knocking out of the park and um and he keeps on pointing to the fake news in the back row and that's where all the news cameras were lined up and what he does that they play the victim\nThey tried to pretend like they're the ones who are marginalized they're the victims here and he's trying to shut them down would in reality what he's doing is he's reacting to their horrible reporting now that you can call reporting how bad it is the reactor he's reacting to their fake news or they have to go and correct themselves all the time he's reacting to their lives about what are you interested in doing\nThe only time that he really crosses the line is when he says we have to change or libel laws and our slender laws then I can hear you know them complain that complete would actually be valid\nBut the complained that he's actually calling you out on what you said the media things and I looked at the Constitution's ... several times looking for this line that says you know um you may not criticized the media it's not in their\nIt'll it says that the the press it will have to be freed the government cannot stop a free press cannot stop your free speech cannot stop your freedom to worship as you see fit it doesn't say that we're not allowed to comment on your press or your speech or your warship it doesn't say that\nIn fact it inherently protects my ability to say I think you suckers a journalist I think you suck is a media member I think you suck is somebody who claims to be a reporter and I'll say that from the highest mountain in America because my First Amendment says I can\nAnd they seem to miss that they seem to lose that point they seem to think that I'll give you an example\nCarry you're going to do a story of the top of the hour for the many radio stations that you do news for our people are allowed to say or people allowed to criticize your newscast I yes of course they are will they be right I don't think there'll be right you don't think I run into someone reported that way but they are a hundred percent absolutely allowed\nTo comment on it and be negative or positive\nThey can say anything they want about it and the idea that people are gonna miss report on this president or report how he doesn't like it and he doesn't have the ability to hit back and say oh yeah you suck as a reporter you are fake news you're not going to get an interview and I'm like I'm a\nNot going to give you a sit down as I might give to Fox News or the two packs he's allowed to say that he's allowed to criticize he's allowed to comment on what it is they're claiming his news and and I would have to believe that those who were on the news media are smart enough or intellectual enough to understand that he's allowed to respond that\nWay I I Know they pretend they don't think he's allowed to but he is now if he starts saying you're fake news I'm throwing you in jail that's a different story I'll actually staying on the sides of the journalists\nYou're fake news I'm throwing you in jail that's a different story I'll actually staying on the sides of the journalists but that's not what he's saying he's just hitting them back and

G. wells and when I was young I was most impressed with the film time after time which is a fictional account of HG wells displaying a prototype time machine and the Eighteen hundreds it was it\nShe was displaying a prototype time machine and the Eighteen hundreds it was it he was at a dinner party\nAnd there was a man that attended the dinner party who secretly was Jack the ripper and he actually uses the machine to go ahead into the future while wells uses the machine to go and find this Jack the ripper and the future and then the shows up in a time machine that's a replica of the machine and display the museum located in San Francisco\nYeah the film does a great job and trying to convince the audience the H. G. wells was a time traveler\nThe film ends with this caption quote H. G. wells was married to Amy Catherine Robbins who died in Nineteen twenty seven as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel and women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six\nNow itchy wells also claimed\nThat he was a Fabian socialist and that he was part of the open conspiracy and that this open conspiracy was a group of men they wanted to establish a future world order\nThey believed that they wouldn't see the future world order in their lifetime that gradually be many people out there secret order\nThey would continue to push for the socialist world order now he wrote a book published in Nineteen forty called the new world order and the book addressed the ideal of a world without war in which law and order emanating from a global as government would occur Hispanic leader that's how ... saw the future now prior to that book wells\nWrote the shape of things to come now the thing about the shape of things to come is it's it's eerily prosthetic book\nBecause it gave the world a dose of predicted programming probably one of the first books to do so and it was a story dealing with new technologies innovations a World War predicted to start in Nineteen forty and the world brought into a new order by a criminal dictator who fortified as the war machine\nSo the part of this book\nActually approximate it'd be rival the Nazis in World War two\nNow he wrote several books and several of his books he wrote that the mission of a shadow government\nIs to create a new world order that would replace world religion in world government he stated that at all of being replaced by collective it's him\nAnd he said it a collective ism would eventually kill religion by replacing it as the new religion and philosophy will certainly was a visionary whether or not he was a time travelers a compelling argument whether or not you know a ... his ideas are going to happen or just like that radio broadcast that we played\nSo when you talk about H. G. wells\nGay and all the things he wrote the I'm a doctor Murrow several things that he he was he was responsible for the idea of a DNA changing a the idea of a aliens invading like in war of the world's he's written all of these fantastic science fiction stories\nOne of the things about wells is that he had a counterpart in the United states yeah and that counterpart was done other than Nikola Tesla\nNow\nThis is where it gets even more interesting because well of course predicted a lot of things in his books and that was the Eighteen hundreds or well predicted a lot of things in his book Nineteen eighty four\nAlso animal farm was also an allegory for government change and strange this so we had these visionaries they were in you know the earlier that we're giving us information the earlier twentieth century\nAnd also a towards the end of the nineteenth century so yeah people even Charles for would be in that category got Charles for you ...\nYou got a you've got a you know George Orwell just go down the list of all of these visionaries they've seen the future or that they they had a vision of the future that we're all living in today so somehow\nThe future that they saw with the future that was happening right now [noise] and it was influencing these men in the past\n[noise] to write about [noise] the future [noise]\nDoes that make sense [noise] that's retro causality right so we moved from H. G. wells [noise]\nOkay [noise] to Nikola Tesla and what he did and we're going to talk about Nikola Tesla coming up it's going to get even more deep for an interesting as we go Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred strip all eight\nSix seven three thirty seven hundred [noise] I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nWas even nuclear that's what Donald Trump says now this would likely be referring to hydrogen bombs rather than the first nuclear bombs because Trump was born in Nineteen forty six after the atomic age was already upon is right that would be a timeline friendly right there\nWell Donald Trump also recalled uh the times how his uncle would tell him many years\nWell Donald Trump also recalled or\nThe times how his uncle would tell him many years ago about the power of weapons someday so that the destructive force of these weapons would be so massive that it's going to be a scary world Trump often cites his uncle's genius as a way to solidify his intelligence basically it was handed\nDown from generation to generation the question that has been raised is what exactly did Donald Trump's uncle find in the papers that were confiscated Nineteen forty three from Nikola Tesla\nOn march thirteenth Eighteen Ninety five\nThere was a reporter that filed a story about how he came upon Tesla at a cafe\nAnd Tesla was shake and he says I'm having a bad night and the reporter said that Tesla told him that during one of his experiments but he was struck by a powerful magnetic charge and then as he was holding on as the charges going through and he said he was able to see the past\nThe president in the future\nAnd he claimed that he was in an energy field experiencing this simultaneously he couldn't leave the field he was stuck in that field and and it had to I guess assistant had to come in and turn off the current\nSo that are so that Tesla could get out of that yeah the fog and have the magnetic\nPresident he was and now the same time is this experiment\nWhat's happening there was a writer who lived in the same era named Ingersoll Laquan now lock would is the author of many books but one that has raised some eyebrows is a book entitled Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey and there was another book called Nineteen hundred or the last president\nOkay now both of those books that are out there are\n... by the library of Congress and can be read in full on archive dot org Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey was published in Eighteen Ninety three and Nineteen hundred over the last president came out a few years later now according to the encyclopedia of science fiction\nLock would depend at least one other book about the Baron Trump character the travels in adventures of little Baron trumpet it's wonderful dog Bumiller which was published in Eighteen Ninety\nNow there was a Newsweek article in July of twenty Seventeen that noted several weird coincidences in the book such as barons trips to Russia a character named John and a Fifth Avenue hotel in New York City where Trump Tower currently stand\nNow I'd say that\nThese are pretty basic and bizarre coincidences to the names and circumstances with our current president\nThe main character's name is the same as president Donald Trump son albeit spelled differently Trump's adventures begin in Russia and are guided\nBanks in directions that are provided by the master of all masters whose name is dawn okay and before\nLeaving for his little voyage through the unknown Trump is told of his family's motto the pathway to glory he's strewn with pitfalls and dangerous but by ... ... you know in Lakewood did his third novel the last president things become even more eerily linked to the present day\nIn the book the last president the story begins with a scene from a panics New York city in early November describing a state of uproar after the election of an enormously oppose outsider candidate this is a quote from the book and says the entire east side is in a state of uproar\nPolice officer shot it through the streets warning city folk to stay indoors for the night mobs of vast size or organizing under the lead of anarchists in socialist said threatened to plunder and to spoil\nThe houses of the rich who were wrong in the press them for so many years then it says the Fifth Avenue hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob the novel continue saying that an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands would be where the troops would step in and save the building\n\nBy the way Trump Tower in case you're wondering is located on seven and twenty five Fifth Avenue\nIn New York the Waldorf Astoria hotel used to be there now it's Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue so\nHow did this all happened how was it that lock would was so accurate in predicting this\nSo this has been a number of people question about whether or not John Trump Jon Jeter Trump the uncle may have secretly stolen secret documents revealing Tesla's time travel experiments now of course this all sounds like fiction writes out of course it is fiction right\nHowever the truth now she even deeper the truth is stranger than any fiction and it paints a picture of a president that may have some knowledge about temporal transcendence\nDon ... a Donald Trump okay\nSo I Want to take it back to that movie tomorrow and and the fictional secret society called plus ultra now according to the film plus ultra\nComprised of the greatest minds throughout history plus ultra was founded by Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison Eiffel H. G. wells all of these people have this legendary meeting at the top of the Eiffel Tower during the Eighteen eighty nine exposition universe out or the world's fair\nAll the man and his so called fictional secret society or time travelers they're banned in this world only to return again in different forms however\nHere's here's where we break the fiction okay\nMar a Lago we all know at mar a Lago\nIs it so that Florida resort that has been considered the second home to President Trump\nRally against it used to be the Camp David is where everybody hung out but now President Trump and his family go to mar a Lago\nAnd he's hosted world leaders at mar a Lago but ah I found out that at mar a Lago\nThe staff there called Donald Trump the king they call him the king kind of like Elvis and if you want to know there are tiles on the walls and the floors of the mar a Lago resort in Florida\nAnd guess what words are on the tiles\nIn mar a Lago plus ultra plus ultra\nMeans further beyond it was also inscribed is a warning on the two pillars of Hercules the two towers and they sat at the start at the Strait of Gibraltar which marked the edge of the unknown world meaning whatever is beyond those towers whatever you do when you go through those towers whatever's beyond the towers is lost in time\n\nThinking about that for a moment Donald Trump\nIs uncle newer Tesla and his work probably knew of the time machine and the time travel stuff that Tesla came up with\nPlus ultra secret society rebuilding the Disney movie where people like H. G. wells who could have been a time travelers who knows uh people like Nikola Tesla and others\nPlus ultra is all over the tiles at mar a Lago and President Trump stays there this is\nCoincidence I Believe uncanny synchronous city that makes you wonder about just who's in control and why certain things have happened and why it seems that we're all out of time and the ...\nWhy certain things have happened and why it seems that we're all out of time and the time seems to be overlapping at a time seems to be giving is false choose and collected recall problems and ... Mandela facts and deja vu\nAnd how history seems to be repeating itself war it's kind of repeating itself in rhyming in such a way that it's confusing the masses\nPlus ultra this is something that he goes beyond\nAnything that I can even come up with but it's true if you look at the mar a Lago tiles I've got pictures of the mar a Lago tiles it says plus ultra but it's written in the in the way it's P. L. D. S. B. L. T. R. A. plus ultra\nJust like in the Disney movies Marlin plus ultra just like the secret society they said existed plus ultra\nEvery member Thomas Edison H.

Donald we eat\nAre never ever ever getting bacteria either [laughter] I don't know if they were ever there and say\nSo a Fisher president will play you three songs tell me which one is Taylor right I think they probably have trouble with it I Do wonder who the Donald really likes like music\nWas apparently back in the day he he did say he liked her music are always ... apparently had but then she you know and she never of course has said anything um before yesterday or the day before about politics so just kinda said that you know and this was years ago before he was elected president by [noise] and so ...\nAnd then so yesterday the president\nYou know has Rosenstein with him on the plane going down to Florida 'cause I mean he's in the ... office and you go and talk to police chiefs and that sort of thing so that that makes sense\nThat you as well to our deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein for being here flew down together the press wants to know why did you talk about [noise]\nSo we had a very good talk I Will say\nI became a very big story actually\nWe had a good to know I talk to you listen we were talking [laughter] I Know on on just a little bit here and what are the best talkers out there who the greatest yeah\nGoing back to tailor real quick lots of tweets about it of course I Am going to read it if you told me two years ago ... it would be running

where we are out into\nHang well especially because I mean she is so um you know you'd you'd think she's very you know girl power or whatever and here she is speaking against a female candidate I'm endorsing too may have\nNot had to do that you can't can't be leaving the tea I'm just wondering day there I'm just\nWondering how much Taylor is able to pay attention to politics amidst everything else that she's doing no I'm\nTelling you if you go read her statement she truly does back it up with some very good reasons it's not just like you know it's not it's a willy nilly post I mean she really does make some good some good statements and you're right she's got a lot going on but that doesn't mean that she can't read and and see what's going on and look up things herself well and not have an opinion\nWhere she can to make sure everybody's got to pay it was\nFunny though I think Mike Huckabee was the one who treated out um something about you know it won't matter because all of her Thirteen year old fans can't\nVote oh yeah see you know those Thirteen year old fans are grown up to be you know thirty year old women\nRight and that well that's the thing is cause yeah I mean he made it sound like that's her fan base now but you have to remember yeah I mean she she is older she does have older fans um case in point right here but I it is interesting a lot of people coming out and saying that\nUm you know they are changing the way they're voting because of what they've seen you know her post in that kind of thing it's it's really caused and the other thing I'm a statistic that came out you know it's like you know ... dot org or whatever had like a fifty wine I I'd I'd have to find the statistic there was a huge tech like up crease yesterday\nUm increase I set up Greece yesterday after she posted that post now I don't know if you can say that was all because of Taylor sure um but it was interesting\nWell and that's fine as you get older things change you have different priorities and the fact that she did the ... okay so now a ... as you mentioned today is the day you got the you got if you haven't you need to uh go out and register to vote if you hate those people who are in office right now or\nYou want to make sure those other people don't get into office ... says uh has caused quite a problem in ... county ... they had a tear in county has seven

looking to unseat to cruise\nA had a simple response to being left off the list were doing fine on our own\nQuote I don't think we're interested in endorsement\nOh yeah really well I Know the reason why people like Beto and is very similar to why they like Bernie Sanders\nNot only did they kind of have some of the same philosophies but they're they're both kind of I'm not what the establishment right they're they're both going against the grain and so that's why a lot of people like him and there you go you said I'm\nSo grateful for him for his service he's going to go down as one of the greatest presidents and yet this election is on Texas\nAnd um we're starting to see a few more those crews signs there were not many crew science just out at all no and again\nInteresting deal maybe you don't put the signs out so that the cruise people started getting a little anxious so they make sure they go out and vote 'em or it could be they just didn't want to spend the money to the Quinnipiac University poll by the way which came out\nYesterday Ted Cruz up by nine and they'd been talking about like two or three points so lazy when if you believe a poll but that's the thing go
