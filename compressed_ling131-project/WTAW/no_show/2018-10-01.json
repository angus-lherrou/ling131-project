garden surrounded by his trade negotiating team from the snowcapped or any merge that Canada and Mexico had agreed to a packed the administration has dug the United states and Mexico Canada agreement or you as the MCAA\nBefore the U.S MCATs implemented there must be approved by Congress won't Trump is confident in its chances he has is that there were concerns with the gridlock on Capitol Hill anything you submit to Congress there'll be trouble he said\nIn a joint statement us trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian foreign affairs minister Christie a freelance so the agreement will strengthen the middle class and create good well paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half a million people who call North America home\nA candidate was brought back into the fold after weeks of negotiations with the deal announced shortly before midnight deadline to Baltimore heralded the agreement any theory the Monday morning tweets\nIs a great deal for all three countries all the many deficiencies and mistakes enough that really opens markets to our farmers and manufacturers reduce its trade barriers to the U.S it'll bring all three great nations together in competition with the rest of the world\nThe U.S mc ... is a historic transaction he tweeted and Trump is regularly blasted NAFTA's disastrous for the U.S economy and long contending that that was the worst trade deal the U.S maybe ever made Trump's and the speech some lawmakers immediately express relief candidate had been reinstate it at a regional trading bloc\nI'm pleased that the Trump Administration was able to strike a deal to modernize napping with both Mexico and Canada and Senate Finance chairman Orrin Hatch\nNAFTA is a proven success Democrats were skeptical however any trade agreement muzzle must be judged by whether it improves the wages working conditions and well being of America's workers and farmers House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said misstatement Democrats will closely\nBecause the workers and farmers House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement and the crowd so closely scrutinize the text and the Trump administration's NAFTA proposal and look forward to further analysis in conversations with stakeholders\nAnd they couldn't reach Sunday gives us farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market and they keep the NAFTA dispute resolution process the rights of wanting to general than in offers candidate protection in turn goes ahead with plans to impose tariffs on cars trucks and auto parts imported over the United states\nNancy Pelosi\nIt's so weird and\nI guess it shows my\nNaivete that I always am surprised but when you're below sea and I'm Wasserman Schultz when they complained about how little a thousand dollars was they told us a lot about Democrats and how rich these people must be\nBecause it's that can be Thirty years when I'm making a pretty good book no a thousand dollars is still a lot of money to me carry a thousand dollars a pretty good bucks\nRight now yes absolutely you're making a lot more than I Am so maybe he doesn't you know back in ... no ... would you ever called crumbs know Raul\nNow so I mean to me it just doesn't make any sense first they say that\nThousand dollars is crumbs no big deal I don't know why they want to raise taxes are going to get the crumbs back and it's nothing but\nThat's what they want us to believe that so what people are going back to work that doesn't really prove anything and now they're going to closely scrutinized this trade agreement a trade agreement that is\nOverwhelmingly good for America American workers remember the dairy farmers in this country did not have access to Canada why\nThere was a two hundred Seventy percent tariff on dairy products from here to there just needs to be closing is unhappy that farmers will be able to to sell their their goods to Canada and not be taxed like that it really does I mean it shows a naive miss\n... in me that I keep on thinking that they can't possibly say something that dumb you're unhappy the jobs are coming back to your own happy the corporations are paying lower taxes or they can hire more people you're unhappy to some of those people three to four million of them got a bonus or an increase in their pay or both\nI get you're supposed to complain about the other side and pretend like the other side somehow is evil evil and your some how good\nA set of extra money\nBut the but the bottom line is sometimes you just say you know what it's a good thing for American workers you know what I'm Glad the jobs are coming back you know what I'm Glad black people are are seeing the lowest unemployment rate they've ever seen in their history and ... and Hispanics and women\nAre going back to work in record numbers you know what those are good things not all I can because this that the other but why complain about things that are universally good I've never understood that the Democrats are gonna closely scrutinize\nVis Newt packed with Mexico and Canada I think\nNancy Pelosi should closely scrutinize harass or anything on that\nNow that do have now you have no comment on it not\nPlease don't say it passed when it's on talking about somebody's ... let me go to our whole lives here sailing welcome to Rudy line one Rudy what's going on\nAge oh what's

NBC unbelievable they're walking about stocks going real high and they were looking good today because of that and I'm like oh wait a minute that's not right when I went and it was\nNever a W that technologies that he Trump and the reason I always say corporate press is when you say ... it points out the hypocrisy of many and the left because you you and I remember not that long ago whenever you talk to the left is the first villain is the corporation or you're rich and it's always a corporation right it was never clear who they met who these corporations are\nBut now somehow when it comes to press which a giant corporation they completely become Mitt Romney conservative right and then the corporations are people to mind boggling I always use that phrase so it can kind of trigger something made the get go get some smart or what\nMind boggling so I always use that phrase\nSo it can kinda trigger something made the get thirty some of the smarter ones that this is exactly who you're his purported to hate\nThat they also have Citizens United and they've got no less than three political action committees spending millions and millions of dollars trying to stop cabinet and you don't get into that second if we if we have a moment it's Michael Malice go and get his book dear reader the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il art so he's you stop the nuclear testing area hasn't done any in a long time\nDo you use a sin back some remains were fallen soldier something that we couldn't get done for sixty years\nOld and he's still go shooting possibly demilitarized during the DMZ with South Korea um what has to be done I mean what what can the corporate media the largest the media the left in this country what can they point to as a failure here because it's an active isn't it I mean you don't just undo sixty years overnight do you\nWell I I mean there's a lot more for him to do I mean we have concentration camps that is the big one to do and I think if that happens if we have the closer the concentration camps then it's going to be a very very hard to well then it wouldn't be Trump's responsibility it would because the moon jail I don't even care\nYou know what I mean if we're talking about liberating hundred thousand people who are prisoners and Trump doesn't get credit that the last ...\nBad enough in is the relationship with us important enough to him to do that will he left these two hundred thousand people go\nWell the problem is when you let them go and you take the gun away from the hostages head then your hold on power because precarious so now it's kind of very hard for him to liberate because\nThen he is going to be on trial and he's going to have a lot and his sister and all of those others died in this you know your accuracy are going to have a lot to answer for for the population\nSo it's a tricky position for him even if he had like some kind of weird epiphany and the best of intentions or you know head back would be in that case just like Saddam would be up against the wall\nIs whose objective right now Michael only to survive in power\nWe don't know it really ... he's clearly making all the right signs you know talk to the moon and sought some hail and his talks with President Trump\nHe's not the same person his father who was very much a function of the Cold War against it so so there is hope there at the same time you know he had been raised for this and he was a kid and he had that whole establishing behind him pushing him to hold the course so we don't know what this man is thinking and he's a very young person too so that also kind of add that to the calculus\nIs Michael Malice author of the reader the unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il also my favorite an artist so it looks like having a little bit about Goldman well your your your your top ... for me watching the Kavanaugh hearings and in watching the ridiculous\nKabuki theater that Spartacus was I called and wrote because now because he was admitted\nOrders of duty grow up to a girl and he's okay to be a senator and then Kamala Harris who's running for president then you've got a corporate shore who\nOn live television one morning show there's nothing wrong with the beer at six o'clock in the morning and she had a guy for drinking a beer when he was in college when you stand back and watch them from your political bent what's your thought ... what do you what are your thoughts I Can't even imagine what you're thinking as you're watching\nI'm thinking of kind of like the Stalin era uh in the sense that show me the man I'll show you the crime yeah uh I mean this is a ... I Do what I Hope is that conservative start to realize that for the ... the jihad\nI mean there will take out whatever they need to do a ... and the thing is I I I Can't ... they're part of me that the cabin a little bit\nBecause she was there at tennis stars right hand\nAnd he saw firsthand have Ken Starr everyday Joe literally every day you remember that you're old enough to remember every day Ken Starr is a puritan can start obsessed with sex Ken Starr is a you know it has all these sexual hang up that's why he's doing his job and Ken Starr who was a dignified man who had a dream of being a Supreme Court kept it now shut\n'cause he felt they will be inappropriate for the independent counsel to respond to these literally daily attack right from his dug the cabinet saw this happening it's happening to him to just say one more thing for the conservative listeners sure\nIf this is what can happen to Brett Kavanaugh this Catholic family man can be made into\nOvernight it's gone from gang rape is alcoholic right just based on nothing right I just think for a second I read this book by jumping height and he made the joke about if a conservative is a liberal who's been mug a liberal or conservative who have been arrested and natural it'll happen to you in many circumstances if you're an innocent person and you get the wrong side of the government\nIf this is what can happen to cabinet I think what happens to average citizens a daily basis so people should keep that in mind set of them of course it just so transparent ... it's just ridiculous\nBut we should be scared to death I mean obviously Dr ... something happened to her but there's absolutely zero evidence that it that he was involved or that it was anywhere near where she thinks it might have been and and the whole I'm afraid to fly was a large she's not afraid to fly the whole you won't come to me yesterday would be the whole that whole thing already his own investigative all\nI I don't know how you invested in we don't know who was wearing when just that she says it\nOr this latest person there's no doubt that the ... shows up was sweating it\nIt turns out everybody who's ever known forever says nothing like this ever happened so at the end of the day what you just said is probably the best thing I've heard not new in the best way to best\nCommentary um in that it's jihad jihadism good but but you're right this is like to the desk for them they're not going to stop is this guy is this going to are going to ever find themselves on the Supreme Court when you know you've got a a flaky guy like this Jeff Flake guardian\nAnd maybe showing the Susan Collins might or might not maybe Murkowski might or might not I mean he's doomed as any I mean there but I think he's doomed\nMy hope is that Alexander Hamilton said the best thing about the British Government is the corruption and my hope and as a I'm a huge fan is that Jeff Flake is corrupt and he wants to make that lobbyists money when he retires and he knows that the lobbyists you better not burned those bridges the Republican so that they take us calls\nDid you hear the opening up those tunes the next day hey anybody want to meet me on an elevator he was making a joke out of it because it's that whole thing has to be set up no\nI agree that it was set up but the question is how dean all this man to and from everything I've seen he seemed to be no that they get which is hopeful that he is going to hold out for the big bucks and a despite himself a vote to confirm Kavanaugh\nThe whole thing is so screw you you and I could talk about this with an eight hour ...\nCan I just said well let me think that I I think honestly that day with the testimony with the craziest day I'd ever seen in politics in my lifetime and Trump wasn't even in the room\n[laughter] this is my God\nYeah yeah but he's an older heads go Michael you know that he's he's living rent free in there\nYeah it was amazing to me like Trump's that even here we're watching the ... Lindsey Graham of all people are ... out of nowhere and Batman and it's you know fighting the it was just not that it\nWas really mad and I was ... it was almost as if it wasn't really happening you ... it was kind of surreal because as you sitting there and sort of a cabinet as you signal reacting to it you got on one side of him the lawyers for the person who's accusing which was completely unfair to believe in there\nAnd then bumping up behind it was almost a mulatto I'm thinking what am I watching here what exactly is happening in my ...\nJoe you were thinking who's the boss [laughter]\nWell clearly it wasn't in her at the at that moment All right Tony ... didn't show up and even if you want to have that would have made the entire scene writes Michael I could talk to you for two hours as I said I really appreciated the name of the book is the reader\nThe unauthorized biography of Kim Jong il get a good five copies give it to your friends and family let's talk again soon always a pleasure Joe back after this when the Joe ... writer\n[noise]\nBeing shelled crabs shall [noise]\n\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone else he'll sleep built asleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the answers to match your body type and sleep references to the perfect mattress\nWhether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper like a plush or affirmed bed which he looks there's no more guessing or confusion just go to healing sleep dot com slash bags\nTake their two minutes lead quiz they're going to match you to a mattress that will give you the best leap of your life you'll get even split the mattress down in the middle providing individuals support needs and feel preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty and you get to try it out for a hundred nights\nRisk free right now he'll eggs is offering up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off all mattress orders get up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off at ... dot com slash pegs that ceiling sleep dot com slash P.
