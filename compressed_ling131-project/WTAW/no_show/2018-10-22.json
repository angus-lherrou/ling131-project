education is the key I definitely do\nWell ... we got to go but I Want you to stay alert stay alive keep preaching the faith in Connecticut\nIt's one of the parts of the country that badly needs the shot of capitalism in conservatism the worst run states in America are controlled by the Democratic party and the best run states in America are controlled by the Republican Party but thanks for your call let's continue with more\nI'm number to call in or to Corey Lewandowski here in about five minutes see was the campaign manager\nFor Donald Trump for like a year and a half and I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight look stimuli call hills breaking loose and ABC and NBC and CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks and two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress\nAnd I said oh contrary Ramon forever I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges here's performed magnificently and all three areas\nAnd I think this is the October surprise that will sink the Democratic party come or the next sixteen days let's continue with more of a line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up in about five minutes or we Corey Lewandowski top of the next hour we have Kevin Jackson near the blacks here\nTo talk about why he was like oh by Fox and the impact in the black community of illegal immigration good at the bottom of the last hour we're going to have on a report from Peter Wallison who's written a book about the deep state the fourth branch of\nGovernment which is the bureaucracy Sosa continuous more built Cunningham the great American live with you every Sunday night [noise]\nI mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no\nIt was appropriate because she was an adult he was the president of the United states\nThe leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with\nThe older and the media would be saying\nThe Congress and Donald Trump had done that with the during the media would be saying oh\nYeah they would give them an excuse drawn away and I'm sure the media would say well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nIt has always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett those Ninety two percent\nOf the media coverage of this president [noise] negative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty five percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent\nI Would expect that but we're not we are we are now back up on top where the most competitive country in the world again for the first time in ten years\nAnd there is no credit for what the president's done let alone the twenty Americans who've been held hostage in other countries that he got returned not one plane loads of cash to our palette loads of money but on his own share when we don't forget these people back\nYou know you saw a pastor come back just a week or so ago and\nThat was a it was a blip on the radar screen the president has getting twenty Americans either in North Korea and Egypt or wherever they have been home that's part of his job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media Brock Obama would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Honduras in Guatemala there's at least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico and the mainstream media hate\nThis kind of an issue percolating a little over two weeks ... from the election because it reminds the American people one of the main reasons Trump was elected was to curtail illegal migration\nFrom Central America and Mexico into our country there's a I like Google this information there is a hundred and fifty million Mexicans Guatemalans Hondurans in El Salvador and hundred and fifty million now like to come to America if you throw in Venezuela Colombia maybe Peru\nA Europe wide Paraguay I were talking to a hundred and fifty million or central and south Americans would love to come to America at what point is enough is enough and the mainstream media does not want to call it illegal immigration they talk about refugee status they talk about the factors moms and dads and children there in strollers\nHowever uh four or five months ago I fell off the couch one night I'm watching sixty minutes and sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border hundreds of dead bodies are found and the deserts of northern Mexico because men are killed because they will become drug meals and that when these individuals\nPaying MS Thirteen literally millions of dollars to transport them from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Mexico into America when this is funding and fueling MS Thirteen dry\nTo make literally hundreds of millions of dollars\nEvery county so to speak they passed through in Mexico\nHas a drug war and order and somebody in charge of that county and that men have got to pay with money and women have to pay with their bodies\nAnd sixty minutes made the point that the majority of young girls and women are raised on the way from Central America\nTo to the United states and when it's reporting which is not done by the mainstream media that this is an extremely dangerous route that men are murdered and that women are raped and brutalized all the way up Fifteen hundred miles\nAnd then when they get a new American that they're they're not released many times you go work in a bra stolen on an Austin you go to Baton Rouge and working abroad or if you're a man you stand on street corners to sell drugs which is paying back your transit seat ... there was one report on sixty minutes about the reality\nOf what the Democratic Party's encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski campaign manager for ... of the reality\nOf what happened to the men and women incentivized to come to this country because what happens\nTo them and so despicable that the Democratic party should be held accountable for some of this why does the media cover it objectively\nThe media doesn't want to tell the real story they want to pretend that the only people who were coming to this country the poor and impoverished\nThat are seeking asylum and and look we're the greatest\nCountry in the world and not only do they two hundred and fifty million people from South in Central America want to come you have people from all over the world want to come here but we're not a country if we can't control our borders Ronald Reagan said it you know Thirty years ago we are the greatest country in the world and the greatest privilege we can give somebody is to make them a citizen\nAnd there is a way to do that but just coming in and storming the borders doesn't work but your point is much more important what takes place with these people and they make this track from Honduras through Mexico and ultimately up to the U.S border is\nDisgusting display of gangs that take advantage of these people they raped women they kill them and and you're exactly right\nEven if they have the opportunity to make it into our country illegally those people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have to make sure that that doesn't continue the best way to do that is you build a wall on the southern border and you say if you make it to the United states you will not make it into our country and\nThey were they process to come here and you follow the process we're a nation of laws and what we don't do as a Republican Party has to make sure\nThat the immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have all the tools necessary to apprehend people coming across the border illegally unlike the Democrats who want to defund\nAnd diligent in mind that men and women who serve in ice everyday that protect us from the animals of MS Thirteen and those gangs\nCorey Lewandowski why do the Democrats want this because there can be no change in the law\nUntil ten or so\nUnited States senators who are Democrats agree to the change which is build a wall brings insanity I think we need temporary workers to come and go when you come you or do we know who you are ... we have a big wall with lots of doors in it and every legitimate person that wants to come here to\nTo work whatever ought to be able to do it but the the the byproduct of that would it be do a lemonade drugs a heroin and math in Cincinnati in Austin in Tampa in Milwaukee\nBy by doing it makes it more difficult for drugs to come in more difficult for him is Thirteen what is the real reason the Democratic party does not won control of the southern border\nCould be because they love the political issue and they don't want to resolve\nThe issue look this president went out and say you give me the money for the wall and all the people that are here through no fault of their own which arguably called the dream where they came in through no fault of their own I Will give them the president said a pathway to citizenship that was a long way to go for conservatives to be very honest with you there was a lot of consternation when he made that statement\nBut he gave the Democrats exactly what they've argued they wanted for a long time and they said no we're not going to give that to they want to have\nThe political football they want to continue to make sure that the people coming across the border\nIllegally and going to sanctuary cities and centuries states have the opportunity to vote we now see this\nIn Texas and we've seen in other places that they are targeting individuals who are not us citizens and asking them to go and vote and they they are bought and sold by the Democratic party those it legal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first\nAnd they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first obligation is to the people in this country to make sure they're safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis but you're exactly right it come through the system your check you are authorized to come and you pay whatever their share it is\nThere is either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country is that how it works that that was always work and we just need to know better job enforcing that\nCorey Lewandowski lastly there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton\nIs making Iran and twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady she was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run I Would help her get signatures maybe raised money for\nWould you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty when you do a great job\nWe love is looking to electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's re election effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred\nAfter he beat Donald Trump\nBeat her by Seventy four electoral votes and what your listeners\nRemember and when they woke up on a lecture at twenty sixteen\nThe New York times and the mainstream media outlets and Hillary Clinton as Ninety nine percent chance of winning today ... percent we get to more than that only two people on the ballot\nSo I Want her to run I run we want to go

said I I've lived here for twelve years this is my home so I've decided to raise my family I Love this community I Love the state\nBut one of the reasons I decided to run this because I've seen a disconnect in this state between the haves and the have nots those who care about health care and public education and those who don't\nAnd I don't think there's a well thought out plan to tackle those issues in terms of state priorities and\nOne thing that troubles me most is this notion of a tribal politics at that has developed\nAnd we have big challenges ahead and I like to see us tackle these things together you know like in the old days when guys were elected they would go back to governing for everybody and I like to see that again\n\nThe opening comments of judge will decide now John writing a\nBook you very much God for um having severe with the chamber and uh I'm pleased to be here I think this is my fourth time to\nTo be on this kind of a panel uh I Would say one thing before we get too far I'm about to have number a grandchild and not much left a better than a actually they're better than the originals because uh they they go home\nBut uh they're very fun and I am here to a ruptured you\nUh this is representative government\nSo I Need to listen to you more than a talk and I'm happy to do that or education is an important issue particularly workforce training and vocational technical training they're very important issue to me and I look forward to working those in the next session\nOr worked on before boot continue to work on those thank you very much for the opportunity to be with you and I look forward to next Russia\nWill start to we'll start with you John ah first of all as we've discussed with the other statewide races a there's a shortfall in a pretty a dynamic economy that we have here in Texas simply because we don't have enough money in their pensions for the retired workers and also the teachers\nUm property taxes is a problem we heard represented because sale not not comfortable with his own governor's plan for two point five percent the property cap so you're a little bit more urban in your district what's your feeling about that and then we'll come back and address overall property will start right there with a two point five yeah well\nAbsolutely and uh education is probably the most important issues that we have a if we have an educated workforce then we don't have some of the problems that we have other was\nFor instance a workforce training we have people who are not capable of doing any kind of job they're they pulled a lot of Medicaid hoped to help them get jobs so they're not pulling that uh money away from education or\nFrom the standpoint of property tax we need to find a solution but it's not in limiting it a local government does a whole lot better job than we do at the state and we do a whole lot better job than they do in Washington\nA property taxes local issue it all to stay at the local level a Houston doesn't have the same problems that Bryan College station has Bryan College station doesn't have the same problems Madison ... let's let the local people vote to measure their government works the way they want it to\nI don't know if I heard you say how you felt about the two point five cat\nA boat to alright of Josh [noise]\nWell like a like Meg last said earlier I can disagree with the premise of the question a we have high property taxes because the state route ...\nStay with the premise of the question a we have high property taxes because the state refuses to to properly fund education to it's a a former level but it's had before and you know we we say that Texas has a dynamic dynamic economy were doing really well\nBut we are we're held hostage by\nBy these powerful entities that don't want to see their taxes go up they they threaten to leave\nAnd they refused to invest in our communities in our state and we've left a lot of money on the table because of
