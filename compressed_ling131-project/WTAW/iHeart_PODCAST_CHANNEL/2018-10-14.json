a political radio on ... and I'm Tracy McCray October is breast cancer awareness month and our guest is a Mayo Clinic expert on breast cancer that tries to go\nAll right and that they're a matter of fact decker goes being overweight increases your risk of developing breast cancer is that a myth or a fact\nThat is indeed a fact uh ... oh wait is when a fire breast cancer risk factors and so\nThe more we can do to keep a weight down the better it is so actual management off that as eating healthy with regular and regular exercise when we say eating healthy it's actually cutting down on fat intake I Would definitely be a risk factor reduction and regular exercise\nUm the other things that will help but as a watching the alcohol intake um because access to alcohol intake is a risk factor for breast cancer\nAlso so we we have the obesity family history obviously ages you get older you're more likely to get breast cancer alcohol sedentary lifestyle in Mississippi\nSounds like what a lot of our expert guess tell us [laughter] I have written for a lot of India's a hardly let's talk about the different types of breast cancer because I Know there are several different ones can you outlined the pores\nSure the breast cancer marker is kind of help us identify what kind of cancer is these are so um we have what is based on the location of the abnormality we can call it breast cancer can be ... or ... cancers\nAre but in general what we're finding is that the biology matters and that tumors that are estrogen receptor positive estrogen approaches strong receptor positive or hurt too positive or negative for each of these markets kinda\nBut just drawn receptor positive ... her too positive or negative for each of these markets kind of identifies what type of tumor this is so and estrogen positive project on pipes to her too negative breast cancer differ from her too positive breast cancer and as different also from what is called the triple negative breast cancer\nAnd the treatment for those is different than that you really look forward to important\nThat's exactly right because now biology is what drives cancer treatment so it's very individualized to the type of cancer the person hats so if a woman has an extradition positive cancer there are medications that go after the estrogen receptor\nAs a patient has a hurt too positive breast cancer we have targeted therapy for her to positive dizzy\nWhat ... what are ways that has come I mean I'm not a breast cancer survivor but I Will meet women who are thirty or forty or cancer survivors and back then there was like one treatment and that was it is that right\nThat is exactly right I mean initially it was women with breast cancer had the option of mastectomy removal of all lymph nodes\nAnd when chemo came into being everybody got that chemotherapy but now thanks to again the breast cancer researchers um who have really advanced to understand number one is that what is the biology of these cancers and then based on the biology try to find targeted treatments that work well\nAnd so even conditions such a triple negative breast cancer at one point these with diseases which were hard to treat\nAnd now we're coming up with new or therapies um managed by our our special oncologist who come and create a treatment that is very specific for the patient you know what I forgot\nWhat are the ... what is a little bit ... radio show which includes you because you had lymphoma when you were a kid\nVery much so yeah that's why I bypass all those other things to go straight to the um All right\nThat's right I mean these kind of exposure to radiation therapy to the breast region ducked increase one's future risk of breast cancer usually we say about eight years out from the radiation the woman should be you're having yearly screening mammography and MRIs alright genetic\nTesting confusing subject what tests are available and who are to be genetically\nTested so when we talk about women with a family history of breast cancer and you're always trying to understand anybody who has a family history with trying to understand based on the family history is there\nEvidence to suggest that this family maybe a family of carrying a gene genetic abnormality that puts them at increased risk\nWhat we used to know it really was the artsy one NBRC aid to two genes associated with very high risk of breast and ovarian cancer\nAs information has evolved as gene testing has become more available and knowledge has increased\nWe have found that there are other genes also that may be associated with breast cancer so what does a woman do typically what we say is that if you have a family history discuss with your physician let a clinician let them know that this is what a family history is\nAnd it's not only breast cancer\nIf you have a family history of breast ovarian colon cancer males with prostate cancer\nMelanoma I'm an even pancreatic cancer these me Obi linked in really any cancer and seek help from your commission so that then we can say does this patient qualified to be sent for gene testing now usually what we prefer is that when there is a family history like that\nWhich they meet with a genetics counselor seek the experts opinion and then they can guide you as to what is your likelihood of carrying a gene mutation that guides what kind of testing to be done\nAnd depending on how you test than you can give a woman advice about what you are doing a frequently she ought to be tested it cetera\nThat's exactly right there are very clear guidelines that a woman who carries a beer or see one or two a gene mutation would benefit from MRI in addition to mammography and the timing of initiating the treatment generally we start MRI at age twenty five for bracket carriers\nAnd then at age thirty we add them wrong graffiti for these racket carriers then at some point when they're finished their child bearing earlier that isn't around thirty five to forty years usually close to forty we start talking about risk producing surgery so again a very important for these patients to be in touch with experts\nTo our editors breast cancer awareness month with the most important thing you want women to\nBe aware be familiar with your breath seek medical attention if you notice any changes [noise]\nI get asked her about going in for a mammogram see an advocate for yourself just\nLike Dr seuss [laughter] subject Arthur goes is a breast cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota record those types of measuring thank you John Tracy some troubling still to come and they all kind of radio we'll discuss treatment for low back pain and later on the program the importance of strength training for women\nNo we we uh we depend on extrapolating from a joint problems are joint injuries such as sprained ankles where we've theoretically believe that we not theoretically I'll say we believe that\nThat uh if we put ice on it to reduce inflammation from an injury well that's not necessarily going to help the low back because the the cold from the ice doesn't get deep enough to affect the physiology down around this fine and the same way with\nDeep enough to affect the physiology down around this fine and the same way with the heat the heat doesn't ... you're down there far enough\nAnd so it's probably affecting the nerves in the muscles that that can penetrate more than anything else and affecting the pain that way certainly ice or he can reduce or some pain and it can help with muscle ... beer having spasm\nBut I Can't tell you there's a write in a wrong application of ice and heat in that situation if it's a cute I Would go with the ice\nFirst I didn't buy at first and when you say rest what do you mean by rescue domain laid out her bed no rest is relative rest and we know that if you lay in bed for three days it's going to be more damaging than helpful\nOr when we lay down we lose muscle mass we leave lose bone density and it doesn't take very long and not being active before those things can become measurable\nShow rest is reducing your activities to the point that you're not making yourself miserable as the way I explained it to my patients\nIt's not likely you're going to do additional damage unless you have like pain medicine tingling down your leg where you probably have a pension or if it's back pain I Would do whatever I can reasonably do without making myself miserable\nAnd I would expect things to get better over a course of a week or maybe two weeks sometimes\nIn some treatment and might be my favorite massage but what else\nThere is evidence for many types of treatment for back pain none of the evidence is strong ... whether it be a the anti inflammatory medicines or spinal manipulation such as a chiropractor physical therapist might provide her massage\nAcupuncture or tai chi or yoga there's some evidence for most of these things but the evidence is not strong for any of it\nAnd that's why we have so many different treatments that people get to choose from\nOf one of my my friend's got a hold them in a wrote an article a few years ago and they described it like going through the back pain supermarket\nYou can just pick things off the shelves that you wanted to try and that's because none of them work wonderfully show as far as what is best in your case I Would say what's worked in the past\n... what do you tolerate what are you willing to do but not only can you do those past things you have to do smack things you have to keep moving with relative restore\nIt and how about prevention view a hint about that and then we don't have to worry about all those options\nNow that would be wonderful if we can prevent all this from a half from occurring to begin with a again we don't have good studies that tell us that we can prevent back pain we know that we can prevent episodes have back pain at times and the only thing it has strong of answers exercise none of the rest of the treatments are we to\nCan really prevent opinion uh and uh there are certain factors do risk factors are that we can alter if you smoke stop smoking because smoking the nicotine affects the blood supply to the ... the outside of the dust\nAnd the small poor is to go in and out of the disc from the the bone and it can increase just a generation if you're overweight if you lose weight it's probably going to help [noise]\nUh if you don't exercise that's a risk factor being sedentary is a risk factor in were more sedentary now in our society than we've probably ever been in the past\nAnd that's probably one of the run of the reasons that there's so many people who suffer from back pain yeah obesity problem yeah how many of us are thirty pounds overweight you know carry a thirty pound backpack around and see what the difference makes it a little bit of course to a slow we don't think of it over time but if it occurs quickly then you become very aware that\nThis is a stress in my back doesn't need\nRight well common problem low back pain unfortunately we don't have all the answers but there are some things that you can do to prevent it ducked rough gay physical medicine and
