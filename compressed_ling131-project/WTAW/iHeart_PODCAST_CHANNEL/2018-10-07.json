get a copy it's got some great insights\nSissy David welcome to focus ... anytime you've got to do that you can't actually John and I really delighted to have you with John were desperate dads\n[laughter] I'm like hey look you know and that's so\nFunny because that is kind of the discussion\nOr in homes the pillow talk between mom and dad I'm sure the girlfriend talk between moms you know my kids really on track and I love this idea you've written about the twelve emotional social and spiritual milestones your child needs to reach what do you think is one of the most basic\nOf the basic milestones you need to see and the child and about what age\nI Would say for boys I Want to see them moving toward progressing towards and and we talk a lot about\nHow practice makes progress I Love your statement a little bit earlier about perfection hunter not looking for perfection were just looking for progress that they are developing a milestone of vocabulary that they can simply named what it is that they feel\nYou know sometimes I think we don't think that's enough but we don't have that long view of time how does it parents chill when it comes to that to know that okay I've got some time here they don't have to have it all down pat by for you know they're going to learn things at twelve that are different than when they're Seventeen\nSo how do you as a parent how do you dial back a little bit in your intensity\nHas one of the first things we say in fact in the introduction to this book is these milestones are different than the physical milestones where we all know that we want to see that kids are crawling by certain age walking by a certain age\nThese are milestones that kids are going to be progressing toward all throughout their lives so you're right no boys going to have mastery of emotional vocabulary by the age of five he'll still be developing that into adult man that we all know some adult men who still need to be developing\nCategory we get it by ... you've got it [laughter] no I'm going to be quiet [laughter] really yeah but ah\nBut in that way again I opened with that idea of the the size church I mean it's so funny when when you do as a parent to the well baby checkup right six month one year especially with your first born 'cause it's all new to you you don't know what to expect and you're the beaming parrot yes he's in the top percentile or she's\nNoticing and grabbing my finger with great strength you know the questions the pediatrician will ask\nBut noticing those behavioral things can become more confusing a little less obvious you know how tall your child is you know what your child ways how do you begin to assess with any kind of accuracy and at what age when these developmental characteristics are coming through how do you do that\nI think for us that was a big part of why we even wanted to write the book because we do have these well defined questions or is he making eye contact is she gripping as he pulling up that she crawling issue walking\nBut we don't have those kinds of questions for kids in these categories so that was a part of why wouldn't want to go first to find the milestones that Dan asked some questions what does it look like to develop what are the nuts and bolts and ingredients so that kids can be practicing in\nProgress to well let's get into some of that so since the upcoming DNA okay the uh the observation window as a child begin to I guess express themselves in a way that you can begin to assess their emotional capacity I mean other than crime right now is an emotion\nHard to get sick and easing and in in our counseling practice we the kids and families and we also do ... and it's fascinating even ... writes kid you know I mean they are probably talked about this a lot anxieties they shouted epidemic in America today and say\nThat is I mean when we first started counseling twenty to twenty five years ago I think\nProbably every three to four out of every twenty families locking in that to where we are dealing with anxiety now I'd say at sixteen Seventeen out of every twenty need me and like all kinds of raising it is and I well there are a million things we can talk it that I mean I actually the big ...\nYes and I well there are a million things we could talk about I mean I actually the big rocks well part of it I mean ... that's one of that change on his part of what NASA is their brains are being over stimulated just bombarded with images\nAnd so then our brains reached this heightened state any of it not just get\nAnd then the kids don't have the ability to calm themselves back down that's one over scheduling honestly we're just doing too much had a girl said to me one time she was really introverted and and lean toward anxiety and she said I had to stop my mom from scheduling activities for me because it was too much and you know where to be the gatekeepers as the grownups and they laugh\nThey let me ask you this for that mom and dad that's just a mom but the parents who are wanting their kids to experience so much in order to get them on the right path to get them on the honor roll past this is really critical that you don't burn them out\nRight and kids are feeling more pressure than they ever what's\nA good thing for a mom and dad to think about that a little healthier perspective that way that it's healthy to have idle time\nIt is absolutely healthy to have\nA growing up ... times horrible idle times horrible but actually some downtime is really critical\nYes and to pay attention I mean that's what you were saying what are you noticing in your child\nAnd they're going to tell you that there ever simulated but it's often getting to be and that's one of the things I was kind of going towards the things out of it comes out of anger typically for girls and boys and so you will see they're going to respond in a bigger weight in the situation warrants and that's when you know something was happening and how can I kinda doubt down and figure out what it is\nThat's good advice I liked the boys and girls develop differently obviously the culture especially the elite culture wants to kind of dumb that down that road was saying that it's just a matter of inputs in society that cast those kinds of but science is pretty straight on this our brain chemistry is different\nThe processes in which our brain a sinks in response to outside stimulation is different\nDescribe for us those differences between boy and girl development\nIn terms of emotional development a great example would be that she will have a more expansive vocabulary period\n[laughter] so she's going to have a more expensive it is true yeah and I'll take them out or we can pick on the females that she has\nMore words she has more vocabulary so her ability to express to articulate hertz is going to be advanced because she's got more words to work with\nAnd in addition to that one of the things we know to be true as\nShe is advanced abilities in terms of reading the emotions on others so she's inevitably going to be ahead of him oftentimes not always are certainly exceptions to the rule but ahead of him in terms of empathy because she has advanced skills in terms of understanding what's going on inside of another person yeah there are two examples right there with\nHim and that's getting off the girls being a verbal more verbal typically that um the boys struggle with expression and when you talk about an emotional vocabulary how do you help boy what age should a\nParent begin to help a boy become more capable in their vocabulary to express their emotions\nWe recommend early on from one year on be using a feelings chart and and it's the starting point that when we're using emotional words with them were referencing a chart and just pointing out felt\nSad today and I because I think I heard a friend's feeling I felt embarrassed today that dads are talking in front of voices say I felt embarrassed today I had to give a presentation to the board of directors and I didn't feel prepared\nThat those words are landing on kids and I would say for boys they're seeing that emotions reside in the life of a man that's what it looks like\nAnd for the listener who may not be grabbing what we're talking about social typical charts that have a happy face and angry face and you have your child point to what they're feeling if they can verbally express it and then hopefully down the line there'll be able to verbalize like you said that's what we're talking about\nAn end to understand accurately what's going on left to his own devices you on this with teenage boys you know their feelings chart would include board and annoyed\n[laughter] pretty much if we get out and figure out what's\nUnderneath what's really going on and so they knew and figure out where there are so many cultural influences that seemed to say guys don't feel or guys are angry when it was kind of two extremes right yes and were quick to push into that meant to say it's not that\nGirls have more feelings she just has more a vocabulary she is a better ability to articulate those things so that's why we have to labor a little longer I Love your word of concentration concentrate on that space with boys that we've got a labor longer than that space so that he develops an emotional vocabulary and\nWe talk about how these milestones build on each other parents are so quick to want to go to I Want\nMy kids to figure out how not to melt down I Want them to figure out how to work through frustration better and that's an important objective but if they don't even know what they're feeling like that's the foundational building block that's why we start with the tabulation we've got to figure out why does it then I'm feeling so that I can then figure out what to do with it\nSo you have all these um obstacles and the culture in in the home and in your make up your personality or gender plays a role and then how do you begin to counteract those to um work with it I guess would be a better way to say it and provide building blocks\nOr that the child like the emotional chart how are you feeling today let's move that up to five years old when they are a little more capable of expressing themselves a sissy with a little five year old girl what are we going to do well\nMoms out there I say this with the greatest respect but one of the first stumbling blocks I talk about is coddling I think there is something so extraordinary and amazing about the relationship between a mom and a boy in fact in the first two stages of his development birth through a\nI talk about how mom is like the center of his universe and he just orbiting around her and and in that it is really easy out of that deep love and that strong connection to do a lot of rescuing coddling with him in fact we will observe oftentimes that it's so much more instinctive for moms to be really hard on girls\nReally rescuing with boys and so that's one of the first things I'd say in helping him develop emotionally is\nBeing able to take a step back and allow him to struggle and allow him to fill whether it's the daily ness of homework you know this math is so hard and immediately pulling up a chair and sitting in right behind them and working at all through every problem with them as opposed to\nCity now for a minute helping him get an stuck in the getting up and doing something else in the house so that he has that opportunity to work through the heart\nBut a lot of moms are thinking he'll fail if I don't do\nThat there's a single mom phase of it I thought if I don't inject myself\n[laughter] or even if if it's you know below he's going to fail it's just it's kind of taken twice as long which it probably will cause heat boys are disorganized and there's a lot of elements in that or each ... he's gonna be that much more uncomfortable and I I talk all throughout the emotional development chapters of just\nOne of the most foundational gifts we can give a boy is learning to navigate discomfort whether it's ... frustration sadness worry whatever it may be one of the greatest gift moms can get boys change your\n... that's wonderful and I love that David ... we are at the end of our time today and I so appreciate your insights into helping our children\nBetter grass these emotional milestones and the next time\nWe want to give you more age appropriate tools and practical ways you can help develop those milestones in your child so he or she can be healthy and relate well to

empty part but using some of the kids yeah\nI mean that's a big moment when they're like now adult peers you say goodbye and and you realize they're not going to be coming back and staying with Amy
