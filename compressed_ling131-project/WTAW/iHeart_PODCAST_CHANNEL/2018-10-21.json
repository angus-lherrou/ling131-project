refers to combining fruits and vegetables in a juice or or juicing machine and you grind that stuff all up into something you\nCould actually drink while juicing may help you get the five to nine recommended servings of fruits and vegetables each day that alone is not a balanced diet and I don't think that that even really counts we'll talk to about that\nHere to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of juicing and I should say a lot of other topics as well as Mayo Clinic dietitian Cape threats gay welcome back to the program Kate thanks for having you know it's always good evidence to show in the program but what is it ... for breakfast\nI don't I'm I'm unless someone truly thinks they have a sensitivity to certain foods like any I you know we want to respect that and we would want to be kind of systematic about our approach to removing foods from one's diet but you know what a sensitivity to elect in is like I\nTruly haven't had many people come to me and say that they have elected and sensitivity and I think it it would\nPresent probably like most other GI symptoms or there might be some\nUm discomfort loading and maybe some bowel issues with them you know along with it\nUm that said I think um it's a it's maybe not as much of a concern as it's made out to be because most foods that are higher and let them like\nBeans um I generally cooked and when they're cooked that leptin is broken down and so it's really not in an issue um and truly than the benefits to eating beans is is is known and in quite good for us so I Would I Would recommend people to eat the\nFor there are a lot of people though who think that electrons are a problem\nAnd there is a or a best selling book on uh I saw it on Amazon I looked it up when you started talking about when I knew we were going to talk about like ... because I'd never heard of them and it's called the plant paradox the hidden dangers in healthy foods is cause disease in weight gain\nBy a cardio vascular surgeon okay um and he says you've got to avoid the select their bad word\nIn it and doing this or sell a book and the ... and a simple and daunting factor is elections are everywhere thankfully Dr ... offers simple hacks we easily can employed to avoid them\nIncluding peculiar veggies oh ... you ever heard of that\nI Would recommend not doing it if you don't have to\nPower I shop for a prudent season I guess that makes sense because he says that a fruit when it's not a completely ripe can that contains a more electrons and you want to avoid those and swap you're brown rice for your white rice so I guess that's probably okay\nSo well and if I Would say if someone surely doesn't think they have an issue our sensitivity to ... again which I don't know that we can quantify if\nAnyone would um in fact having brown rice having a whole grain would actually be preferred unless you have a reason um and hopefully medical reason not to\nTo have that so we were in unless indicated otherwise I Would say people should have their whole grains I'm so I Would prefer that people would eat their brown rice over their white rice most of the time\nYou can buy this book the no I didn't but there's all sorts of cookbooks to or that will avoid like where is your diet it sounds I actually like it's impossible but they're out there [laughter] and that's Kelly Clarkson says\nI read this joke at work in his shoe singer so\nShe said my auto immune disease is gone and I am thirty seven pounds lighter ... because if she's been on this low intellect and\nIt's another fad a type of fat diets that if you limit some foods that you we are going to lose weight\nRight and I I think if if you are to look at the computer to look this up and looking at it like many fad diets and is restrictive in nature and so there are many foods that are eliminated and so when you start eliminating many foods\nThe likelihood of someone losing weight and you know ... is probable and unlikely to happen and oftentimes when people lose weight and their their body responds generally they do feel better or so\nThat said a lot of the foods that are suggested that eliminated in this left in free diet are very healthy nutritious food than actually\nOur foods that are thought to be anti inflammatory and in that it's kind of a counter argument that that they some will say they're inflammatory but there's other substances in that so that that are actually known to be anti inflammatory basically it's a bad I I Would say it's a fat and\nThen you don't think there's any good evidence to suggest that you ought to be on a low locked\nAnd loaded left and I\nI don't think anyone should be on a a low ... diet absolutely because I don't I don't think it's possible to\nA low leptin diet absolutely because I I don't I don't think it's possible\nTo eliminate elections because they're in all plants and we want people to eat plants now within the plant family there are certain types of plants that people may have sensitivities to and I think if that's the case again we'd probably want to take a systematic approach to looking at one's diet and and trying to eliminate foods\nI'm In a way that doesn't eliminate all and so and there would be a re introduction of foods because we don't want people to be an overly restricted diet\nUm because that's not um an easy way to live life and I and in terms of the long term healthy diet and so we want people to eat as as many healthy foods as they can and to avoid the ones that truly get them problems and it to for some people that you know just in terms of food sensitivities it might just be\nHow it it might be how it's cooked it might be the dos and the amount that you eat in any one time so often times there's there's a wage around to include foods but maybe just within a reasonable way of doing it\nAll right so now we have to talk about robotics and our last few minutes but as long as we're just ... out as afraid that she's going to die because of all the probiotics for what she heard on the news this morning and so again when you talk about fads but circling back around that probiotics are bad or is that what the message messages\nWell and I think that the messages that it's an emerging science and I think as ... as more and more research is done in this area where we're seeing maybe a study that they're showing benefits and then we may see a a study that shows the opposite and and and does not show those benefits and so I think\nThere's much to be learned um about ah the got micro biome that's the the bacteria that naturally live within us and and its role um in our health and disease states mhm so I think more to calm\nUm that said when we talk about probiotics as being a dietitian and I I Would bring the conversation back to food yeah and and your yogurt in there is I suppose that made me naturally have some robotics and then there's foods that are considered pre by addicts that may\nOr helped the set up the environment within your got 'em to be healthier place to maybe promote\nA gut Flora that may be health healthier beneficial\nSo the story that your friend her this morning and um that were referring to there's taking the capsules pills that are labeled as probiotics that's one thing and then there's eating a serving of ... or sauerkraut and isn't that line getting blurred\nRight and I think when we step into that arena of taking a probably a probiotic or even having a drink recognizing that this is an unregulated industry and so you can say that you have\nThis strain of bacteria or this much of this bacteria but\nQuite honestly we don't know that that's absolutely true and we can't say with certainty that that's the best thing or that's going to be an NSA you and I again we just I don't think we have that science yet and so I think it comes back to\nBuyer beware um and there are some people that report that they feel very well when they take a pro by addict capsule or that they may have a drink that contains a prophylactic\nNow whether that's a true affect our sets a placebo effect we don't know um I think if it if they're an otherwise healthy person they can they could they can probably practice that safely but that's not to say that that's the case for everyone\nAll right well let me tell our listeners what we're referring to hundreds to report that came out recently in the journal cell which is a peer reviewed journal by the way\nAnd it says quote a cast further doubt on the benefits of the highly commercialized ... products\nBecause they are marketed as dietary supplements not drugs brought up by addicts do not need to be approved by the FDA for claims that they\nPrevent or treat any health conditions and basically these two studies said they did nothing\nMost of the patients who took them they all went they went in one end and came out the other than the other was a concern that your friend referred to was the fact that if you have taken an antibiotic it may actually take your got longer to recover it would be dead broke ... addicts\nAh versus loving Mother Nature have or what to do it that way and it'll that hearings is back to food yeah and I think that's exactly right\nAnd and eating nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables and whole grains allow your body to have the ... the proper environment it and it can play with the ph or how the foods you know the fibers and and how things are digested there to set up an environment that is going to promote maybe a health care Flora\nAre juicing as good will decide that we\nDeliver it to them they're good with their seldom is about probiotics are certainly some question about whether the claims are true\nAnd let them not probably not to worry about having to wear their lessons and your diet Cajun recipe ... says so much for being with thank you [noise]\nFeel like I'm On male clinic radio will learn more about poly cystic kidney disease and later on in the program common diseases of the hair [noise] do you have a health related question you'd like to answer or a topic you'd like to cover you can tweet us anytime that has shaped Mayo Clinic radio or send an email to\nUsually every four years of treatment or what do they the the need for the U.S is by one year or so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years or there's not a big a long long studies because it's a chronic disease that means many years to study but so far\nThis has gone up the expectation that's how it's gonna it's gonna need that\nThis loud fantastic do how do most patients find out that they have this disease and if you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history\nA so mostly are the majority of the patients will have someone in the family that has this disease and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnose by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see this is exactly so we look at the ... and we have kind of criteria is and how many cyst and depending on the age because the ... the older you are the more says you have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening by alter sound and then we can do as the teams can order him or not to look more at that kind of the the kidney says and how big is the kidney and then we can ... um give a prognosis or how the patient would do depending on how this is our\nAnd if the patient wasn't aware that they had a family history of poly cystic disease what might be their first symptoms what might lead them to come in and see\nYeah there's about five to ten percent of the patients that don't have a family history so that could be either a new patient so new defect in the gene that just happened in these patients and usually the first sign of either high blood pressure or they get a a some kind of leading from the ... so they see blood and urine and they get pain in the ... and they're back\nOr a sometimes an infection in the system they get a fever and then the pain and then uh they get to imaging and that you are probably and then they got the CAT scan or some kind of energy and they've seen the ... and they would diagnose than we\nDo high blood pressure or blood in the yard for uh people who have poly cystic kidney disease or there's a whole family history and um what is the takeaway what are those patients need to know\nSo it's really an exciting news for all these patients for example yesterday I offered the treatments for one of the patients who ... who kind of told me the story that even in the Eighteen hundreds they know that they have some kind of ... this was some kind of kidney disease\nAnd actually when she knew that there's an FDA approved drug she started crying actually for several minutes it was very exciting so for these patients first they need to make sure that they're getting good health care so uh in terms of blood pressure and then see if they are eligible for this medication\nOr so not all the patients would need to be treated in fact so some are slow progress or so there's this are small enough and small number that they don't need to be on any treatment except just being healthy and how you treat the blood pressure\nBut some patients would progressed very fast and they wouldn't need a ... in their forties fifties and these patient would benefit most from the treatment so it's important for these patients to be checked\nTo know where they kind of are are they slower fast progressing and then uh probably seen their kids as well now that there's a treatment we're the commanding that be checked for for this disease because there's something to do about it and the drug widely available\nIt's very news so I just got approved in may there's many logistics around this medication it's regulated by the FDA and we need a lot of luck testing every month for the first year and a half\nIt is available it's kind of expensive drugs so probably is some new and how the insurance would cover and\nSo forth but we're working with all the patients who are asking about it and we're kind of doing something that we're in is to kind of set these patients come\nTo their uh can you doctors be checked and also check their kids\nAnd what's next in the research a lot of things are exciting actually at Mayo so we have well great may be kidney center and we do a lot of translation research in a way that we do a research in the lab and try to translate it to the patience to to get new treatment\nSo we have a new targets actually move very excited about and a couple of drugs or medications that could be effective so hopefully that would be the next the good treatment for ...\nUh to help not only slow down the toll for the cure the disease and not have any station

Don Davis are very favorite dermatologist for male clinic with us to discuss hair issues is there a real show topic on just hair\nThere is in fact I think we could talk about hair from multiple shows and still not be finished well I suppose if you throw the scalp and they're with it too right and so the issue with the hair is that it comes from the scalp and so there are two different things that can go wrong to give you a hair disorder one you can have an issue with the actual here shaft which is what we call hair\nThe dead protein that comes in a long chain that comes out of our scalp or you can have issues with the scalp itself but then causes the heritage not grow and so I think the lay public is very aware that as you age you can have\nThinning of the hair what people would call male
