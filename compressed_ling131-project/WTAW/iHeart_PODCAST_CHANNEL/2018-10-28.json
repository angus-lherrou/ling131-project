card specialist stuck for sure have we talked about\nPregnancy and heart but what about heart disease is women age especially after ... years\nWhich leads us to where I'm at their matter of fact more than one in three adult women has some form of cardiovascular disease a Dr Hayes is that a matter of fact\nIt would be a fact oh boy\nAt that price for women when you talk about this absolutely and in that in that statistic\nWe do include hypertension which is on on the rise and increases with the each year of age particularly in women after menopause because at that a great\nSegue ha ha mental pause just one of those things that again like we said with childbirth or I didn't really consider what heart health white impact that might have on my pregnancy I wouldn't think about it about a menopause relation but of course it is well it is and probably it's\nBetter known honestly because we have as women age they they have gotten this boost perhaps the protection ... compared to men of about ten years they get about a ten year grace they present with high blood pressure and heart attacks on average about ten years later than men\nNow there are some exceptions to that because women who are\nAre diabetic actually it eliminates all of that advantage but um for instance women's blood pressure tends to be lower than men up until about the age of ... around age fifty and then when and blood pressure starts going up men stays high but it levels off\nSo it is a time in life that is both a change related to changes in hormones but I think pointing out it's not an abrupt change an abrupt uptick but think about other things that happen to women around the er at age fifty fifty one which is the average age of medical us\nOff and they become empty nesters they have changes in job changes and physical activity they get a bum near plant or ... and they get less active there a lot of things that come around that time that can confound and worse and an increased risk for cardiovascular\nDisease has a special time [laughter]\nAnd she is a it was free and I just feel sorry [laughter]\nDoes estrogen help protect the heart [noise] so complicated question um we believe so\nUm the endogenous or the estrogen that is in our bodies in during the pre menopausal state we think that that it because they're estrogen receptors on every blood vessel in the body and it keeps women's blood vessels um elastic and healthier\nIt's more complicated though in terms of and I don't want any of the listeners to hear that yes oh that means I should add estrogen back to protect my heart after menopause\nSo the women's health initiative showed that at least in older women who are a few years past menopause adding estrogen back didn't help them didn't help their hearts it may be and this is the the the question that continuing it at a low dose if you're that already healthy heart\nI'm early after menopause might be something but the general rule is we don't recommend\nAdding estrogen back after ... laws to protect the heart at this point so let's talk about the distribute the risk factors again\nProtect the heart at this point\nSo let's talk about to distribute the risk factors again going to do the same for for men and women and they're the same risk factors essentially for erectile dysfunction Alzheimer's disease interestingly\nBut so diabetes obesity high blood pressure smoking smoking a sedentary lifestyle lack of a activity cholesterol\nYet cholesterol triglycerides and women so lip it's as holes in it um the standard total cholesterol we've kind of moved away from and just saying little over two hundred you have ... high cholesterol because you can have other factors in your uh cholesterol that puts you at higher risk\nUm particularly for women elevated triglycerides um which is another fat in the blood that is more influenced by dietary sugars 'em and carbohydrates as opposed to fats and genetics\nThe other is where you put on your fat and so we don't like this part [laughter]\nSo you can be normal weight but if you have a ... distribution that is mainly in your middle and your waistline as opposed and your hips and buys for women and for men that conveys an increased risk and so when you start gaining weight I'm even going for normal weight to higher weight which often happens as we get older\nI'm puts women it even higher risk\nHow important does activity uh especially postman apart\nSo when people ask me what's the most important thing I can do to prevent heart disease if there are smoker that's number one number two is physical activity and the reason I say that is there's such\nUm deep and broad strong evidence that it makes an impact not only for cardiovascular disease but for Alzheimer's and for bones and osteoporosis and for preventing falls and being strong so physical activity as great\nThe other part is it's never too late to start physical activity we actually have scientific studies that say that women who start out at walking program over the age of sixty five actually reduce the risk of heart disease from the nurses how study\nSo it's free it's not sexy however and it's a hard habit to adopt if you hate exercise\nAs some of my patients do do you feel like your patients are getting that message and are trying to become more active in mid life so I think women are so busy and one of the things so that the answer is yes but okay but I think getting back to why I'm women don't take time to take care of themselves\nWomen are raised in a culture ... to be caregivers their moms they are you know they're the group's leaders there often even if they're in the workforce there the moms at work\nAnd and so often when we ask women even who had a heart attack why don't you make this change or eat healthier exercise\nI don't have time because I'm driving my kids um my husband wouldn't eat that healthy foods so I'm just going to make it\nAnd so flipping it so that they know that if they can do those things they will accomplish those other goals I eat caregiving and making an altruistic thing which can be very helpful and that's been my biggest success in helping people frame it when I don't have time because none of us have enough time to do this thinks its priorities\nWe've talked about uh the the major risk factors and how important it is to keep all of those under control and exercise is extremely important let me ask you about a couple of other things with regard to heart disease prevention\nOr there's been some recent controversy a baby aspirin a day what's your feeling about that in women who don't have a history of heart disease\nSo that's an important distinction to make because nothing has changed in terms of our recommendation to keep having a heart attack a stent or have a have had cardiovascular disease you should be on a baby aspirin unless your doctor tells you otherwise [noise]\nFor individuals male and female particularly older individuals who are otherwise healthy don't have diabetes don't have other things\nThe risk of taking aspirin and people don't think about that they just because it's non prescription or actually grader or outweigh or at least are equal to any benefit that one has pretty much stomach bleeding mainly\nStomach and other types of bleeding because it it irritates the stomach but also you know wading into your brain and women and everything we do and every medication and every intervention and cardiology women bleed more so if it's a risk for men it's a bigger risk for women alright fish oil\nA fish oil was very popular I'm a five or six years ago until we started actually having data from randomized clinical trials\nSo I asked if I have somebody come into my office and they're on fish will ask why you're taking them 'cause there are other reasons and heart disease you might take fish oil\nBut I tell him to stop it is yeah because it's really not been shown to have any\nPrimary prevention benefit or really even secondary prevent what if they don't like fish and they think I don't like fish so I'll just take visual tablets so probably doesn't help okay so that recommendations is he finished a couple of times a week it's not harmful but people who are also on blood thinners\nIt ... if you take high dose fish oil it actually can than your blood more than I Am a less is more I go through every patient list I say why are taking it while you're taking it while you're taking it and they say I don't know I said then asked the doctor who prescribed it for\nWhy are you buying it and spending your money out of its over the counter\n[noise] All right we've been talking about heart health and women's votes during the reproductive beers and after menopause with such specialists cardio cardiologist Dr Sharon and start to raise much much\nAbility or a colleague however can then Rick or if it's developed one so that's when we start to entertain intervention a small portion of patients who've had bill Eric colic will go on to develop more serious complications of coal it's just I Swear the pain per se is\nThe goal butter is very inflamed and removing it is I'm less selective in more urgent\nSo I Want to ask you about the risk factors for developing a gallstones when I was in medical school it was a female that forty and fertile now I don't know whether you can still say that maybe they've changed the words but is that still true\nThat still true women developed gallstones twice as often as men because of their millions of estrogen and pro Justin's in the bloodstream\nWe know that a certain ethnic groups develop a gallstones much more often American Indians Native Americans or the probably the highest prevalence of gallstones Hispanic populations fairly high Caucasians below that and and African Americans are less than that even\nSo I'm uh ethnicity is important family history is very important probably a twofold are threefold increase in likelihood of farming stones\nAre overweight states especially with the BMI over thirty the risk of gallstones is quite a bit higher um and multiple others that are gradually less important fertility though the fertile part to having a pregnancy is a\nA high risk factor for developing stones or gold butter sludge a precursor to stones\nA sludge often resolves after a pregnancy and stones tend to stick around so if someone's had multiple pregnancies their likelihood of stones as much higher\nIs is mostly diagnosed because there's pain presence is that would bring patients in\nSo most gallstones probably go undiagnosed um but the ... of patients have a variety of symptoms that may or may not be related to stones\nAnd then they're usually fairly easily diagnosed by ultrasound so identification of stone's is generally straightforward except a small proportion of tiny tiny stones um but then the attribution of symptoms to the stones is sometimes a much more difficult issue\nI can tell you that there are outliers in I Am one of them the mail that forty and fertile and none of them and I had my gallbladder out and that's the pain is extreme\nOr in fact I was in the emergency room three times with the same similar pain and since I don't but the bill for having a goal bladder diseases took them a while to figure that out but the good thing is you can take it out through the laparoscopic it's relatively simple straightforward surgery or in what overnight and really\nI didn't have to change my diet at all so that the surgery has absolutely remarkable are there other treatment options decide surgery\n[noise] [laughter] well other options have been developed over many many years but with the advent of laparoscopic approaches to surgery\nOr many of the other options became less realistic less cost effective ... less they're less effective uh themselves so closest to me is really the only realistic option for the patient who can undergo surgery is a surgical\nCandidate All right Dr Beth Peterson ... talking about gall bladder disease thanks so much for being with us or at like if\nWe're going to take a short break when we come back we'll learn

here to discuss conservation as Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist actor gene Fox welcome back to the program Dr Fox thank you good to be heard Tracy could morning\nBut I started to broach ringer I Know you're busy because this is such a common problem and I think the first question is what is cause depression how do you an expert ...\nWhile constant patient means different things to different people as as you to have already touched upon time punch to a patient can mean straining to have a stool and frequent stools hard stools it can mean a sense it incomplete evacuation\nSo a lot of times when I'm visiting with patient I Try to get right to what they're experiencing rather than using the broad term what is the cause of conservation well there are lots of different causes one of the most common causes can be diet\nEither you know eating a very low residue diet are very processed diet what do you mean by the residue some more processed foods are kind of ... fast foods um you know that white squishy bread that we all loved his children and wonder where it yeah that sounds so good for our digestive system\nThe other thing is skipping meals so people who are skipping meals don't experience a what we call a gastric colic reflex which is a reflex where\nWhen your stomach is distended buy food you're colon contract and that makes the Colin one to empty\nSo people who are frequently skipping meals\nCan have issues with comes to a patient as well [laughter] another real big one is not drinking fluids were not drinking the rights fluids and sometimes I'm particularly with my older male patients who may not want to be\nJust sturgeon have to get up at night they may be really limiting their flu it and take and then\nThat can cause a difficulty with their digestive system and lead to comes to a patient says laid plans on that one yes and another one is medications so whenever I visit with somebody in the clinic is experiencing difficulty with comes to a
