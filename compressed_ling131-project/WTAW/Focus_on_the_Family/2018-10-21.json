stressful season and it's a little like that movie twister you know it's like a storm hits your lab at twenty eight and ... no matter what the transition still if you run into shelter\nIs tight yourself with your spouse died\nHang on you'll make it through and you'll go for the ride of your life how that\nHolding onto each other through every transition\nWell the seasons life very plea include difficulties and challenges and you'll hear whether that twister how to weather the storm bitter on today's focused on the family with Jim daily\nI'm John solar and we have relationship experts bill and Pam\nFarah with us back in Studio ... we do John and there are some predictable and unavoidable transitions\nI think we all go through we may not notice them or put a label on them but we go through them and some people are more aware of them than others and today we want to discuss that that we're all familiar with the old slogan that says baby makes three and the empty nest\nThose are transition points and there are others in your marriage that probably put a lot of stress\nThe tornadoes Pam answered there into your marriage into your relationships\nOr you know gene and are kind of in that right now we're two teenagers are we are when the typhoon I guess you might say and it's good it's you know we're taking deep breaths and all is good and uh we're hopeful that these kids will do well and make it through this period of time but it's a transition point force\nIt's important for us to learn how to handle these moments and it may be seasons that's probably a better way to say it at today we want to give you a few tools to help you identify when you're in that tornado season and when you can take a deep breath\nAnd as I said bill and Pam feral or here they've been in marriage ministry for over Thirty years and founded an organization called love wise\nAnd they're very popular conference speakers they've written a number of books including the ten best decisions a couple of can make and I'm kind of formed the foundation for the conversation today bill and pat welcome back to focus on the family\nAnd I thought to be here you don't have that great foundation in our life when Lee where young parents it's wonderful to be here give it to always\nGood to hear that we're focused Dr Dobson had a you know in front of people's lives were hoping to continue that with young families today\nI'm In your thirty some years of marriage ministry you've observed that transitions can either make or break a marriage that seems self evident but maybe not talk about those transitions and why they often times or the breaking point for a relationship\nBut it's amazing to us after all the research has been done and all the the the teaching and train has been done people still have a tendency to think\nThat marriage is going to be the same throughout the years steady yeah they fall in love they've met the right person we just had this magic between the two of us and it's going to be like that forever and then they the inter real life and suddenly like starts to change on them\nAnd what we know about people is that it did change points in people's lives are where the testing comes\nIn between those testing the kind of get things settled in the entire season of life where we now know what to do and they'll crews along for anywhere from five to ten years pretty well and then one of these transition points hits and everything has to change and couples who expected and couples who are prepared for it\nTends to utilize those change poised to become stronger couples couples who get surprised by those change points tend to go into turmoil well how do you prepare\nYourself as a a young couple married for three years you're getting to figure out now that you know it's not always study or a there's dips how do you prepare for the debt emotionally\nYou know one of the ways is to get at great mentor when bill and I am white newlyweds and that was ...\nAnd the big challenge during the time is that most people on earth their desires are bigger than their abilities\nSo you mentioned your wife she was affected her career but then she also wants to have a family and so she has these desires that all take up time and all take up focusing all require energy\nAnd it it comes down to I just don't have enough hours in the day for enough energy and my soul to do everything that's on my heart to do and will upset yeah and I think for women particularly the that the need to be two people\nYes it is a stressful for it's impossible\nTo cheat but the demand for being to people or three people is always there let me ask you to respond to a listener who wrote into focus\nAnd I think as a very specific question that puts this into context or she wrote to us and said I feel like I made a mistake by marrying the man I did were not the same people we were when we got married we want different things have different morals and values\nAnd disagree on how to raise our kids are we ever do any more if I Am I supposed to continue in this miserable relationship\nUm what would you say to her what is her hope\nWell first of all I Would say to her every relationship is one breakthrough away from being a great relationship ... and when things get out of kilter things get us out of sync\nPeople start to think oh it's a tragedy it's never going to turn we disagree on everything and it starts this downward spiral that begin starts to feed on itself ... and so now everything is evidence that this is a bad relationship\nAnd in reality all it takes in marriages one decision can turn everything because obviously this couple used to be in sync and they they loved each other and they had the agreements that they were moving forward on and now probably my guess is the stress of life has pushed them to a different place\nThis focus on the family broadcast continue in just a moment and\nWould you wonder why we're so committed to the community remember we're the only locally owned media NBC us and we think it matters WG a W College Station Bryan\nThanks for listening to focus on the family and\nLess resume now with the balance of today's program\nA building you just said that every relationship is one breakthrough away from being a great relationship and I appreciate that optimism that hope\nI'm going back to the listener question the gym just read where does that woman begin or what can she do right now to make a change in her heart and reconnect with her husband\nWell if she were to start praying God show me how to get to that breakthrough was like I Want to be on my husband's side fighting against life rather than fighting against each other\nGuy can start to orchestrate her heart to where she gets to a place where she's softer and her response to her husband and she starts to find boundary she can set up its start to change the system because once one person starts to do real change\nIt's amazing how often there's a big change in the relationship that takes place that takes the seemingly incompatible areas of life\nAnd suddenly starts to turn them back to where they were when they started this relationship you know\nThat's why it's important to have like rules of engagement how you're going to argue and for example\nBill and I have a conflict covenant and we in a conflict covenant have things in at like will hold hands when we're in arguments because you're just\nLess likely to throw stuff you know when it's hard to do the harder it is I'm\nIn a conflict coming at you know the I Will take the word divorce out of our vocabulary we're not going to swear at each other when I got a huge problems to not run over you with the truck when I'm Upset you know\nThose Dane on that but yeah I like for her [laughter]\nSo and it's just important to have that conflict covenant town as a part of your agreement and maybe picturing how that conflict cabinet in real life situation would help that list are for example bill and I are longest argument was during my midlife transition and um\nIt lasted for a year him because we had this rule that ... there was a long conflict but we had a rule that we finished every conflict things every argument or whatever or what I mean by that is that we're not done until we appreciate the strengths that let us into that argument and we're back in love with each other\nAnd we would have a conversation couldn't resolve it we would pray together rescheduled\nWe get together again talk it through pray together reschedule wow and we did that for a year that's a long time and because we stayed at it it added a lot of value to our relationship even though we're we're struggling to find an answer\nAnd we both were praying and um I Am I re entry woman I'm trying to\nFinish my degree and we have um a couple of kids are just with three kids at that playing I says to while and I'm selling ... just flew in a way I you know a little at a time on my degree and those are the senior pastor of a new church and so there was a lot on our plate\nAnd and the passion and Pam's I scared me because we had these young kids and I saw it\nPassion and Pam's I scared me because we had these young kids and\nI saw this desire to get her her career up and running and his desire to start writing books and his desire to create a mystery for women it was going to be effective and it looked too strong to me and I thought it was going to throw the priorities of our life completely off if she really ran with this thing\nAnd so we're both ... am I Am praying like lord I'm trying to follow your call and feeling like you want me to do this but does that send me bills praying I what I'm trying to follow your call back like this really irritating\nBut it looks like the mid west and I talked to was the resolution\nHere's the turning point we one day we were just so upset at the end when it those disagreements scheduled arguments and I just I just started crying I fell down on that as kneeling by the so fat and I I just right next\nTo her and we're both just so fresh or we had no idea what\nWe're holding onto each other even though we don't like each other rang and I'm like Jesus\nI don't know what's going on here I'm just trying to like do what you want me to that there was so mad at me and like I don't know I Know I don't like this I don't like this and so please God if there's anything that you need to change me please do it please fix this thing I don't know what to do please do something and built\nAnd I followed up and said yes I Love this one but I don't like her very much right now and I don't know what's wrong our relationship but something's gotta change so if somebody needs to change me make it obvious to me so I can change it and it's something needs to change it and make it obvious to her so she can change whatever needs to change just show us because we can't keep going like this ...\nNothing changed immediately but later that night I said oh by the way tomorrow when I Am and class every day I have to stand up for my face and in the English class ... it just pray for me I Know you have to do some filming for the church up there on campus is and\nThis realization hit me every effort pray that desperate prayer this realization hit me that I thought I was arguing with Pam but it turned out that was really arguing with God over this because the reason why Pam couldn't calm down the passion is a gutted put this dream in her heart\nAnd it created a problem for me because I knew if I was arguing with Pam I could probably outlast rent win that argument\nBut now that I realized I really was argue with what God was doing in her life I knew I couldn't win that one and he was guys we like to win so when we really we can't we have to do something so I said God I Need I Need to change now I Need to turn my attitude on this but I Need to do it in a way that's convincing\nBecause I spent a year arguing with Pam and if I just went to her and said he realizes what's going on and I'm Sorry and it's over it wouldn't be very believable ... after a year of arguing your choice you can you give me something so we're communicating has to pay him\nSo I was in that class the next day and the professor said\nAnd we're sending their romantics romantics it's impossible no two people to stand up for a lifetime it's an illusion and then all the women are like yeah because men are ... now the guys like sinking down in their chairs and I'm just busy taking notes and the door popped open in ... my hand some has been like a dozen roses and he comes out [laughter]\nI gave her kids she I said\nTo him I Love you and walked out of the room\nAnd my professor just like is it your birthday and like no he's a ... year anniversary and like now that he's like well why is he in my class that I said well I I think that bill just wanted me to know that he believes in me he believes in the dream that God is placed on my heart and he wants to be on my team and then all the women like soda is they'll have a brother\nAnd what I Know\nAbout cameras Pam thrives on public attention [laughter] your wife doesn't like public attention this is not really a good idea but I knew him does so I figured if I went into her world and made a statement that the message we get across\nThat's very intuitive I mean most men miss that ... mile\nDrive you said was that prayer\nPart into both of us that whole year even though we were very much and disagreement and we did not see life at the same way God kept giving us a little things along the way like Pam adapt your schedule so that doesn't interrupt the senior pastor's life ... father the kids now moved to the class around to\nBill on give those affirming words even do you not understand what's going on and your wife slashed she's talented affirming the talent\nAnd you know he just kept giving us little things to help us hang together through that twister or tornado a storm of life\nA villain Pam what an invigorating discussion I Hope people are helped today and that if you need to talk to somebody calls you focus on the family or counseling department is here for you we have wonderful people who can put tools in your hand resources\nFrom the edge of the country that he's kind of common and we have in California\nAnd sell 'em many things are common [laughter] and then keep it for the same principle applies those men band together that ... and stay at home dads they get together and create each other they look for a mentor men who've gone to transition\nEven in our own church windows senior pastor and his assistant had a health crisis\nAnd that put him on disability at a very young age\nIt helped crisis and that put him on disability at a very young age and his wife was the primary bread earner but he chose to get retrained so he could shepherd\nI'm In the church but yet be the dad at home and I'm so we had both role models in our church we had bill and being the typical traditional us and then the other pastor\nUm who just because of his health had to make other choices but both families the kid's flourished that's the main point and that's the goal and that's the goal and\nEvery situation we only mentors and even more so when it's something unusual night need somebody else has gone through this\nAnd I'm One of the things that we talk about and mentoring is you know sit down together and say who\nHas the kind of marriage we want to have who has a kind of family we want to have who has a kind of influence and ministry or and business that we want to have let's go talk to those people be pro active\nBill and I approached and Jill Briscoe and um when I was a young pastor's life because at the time Stewart and Joe where like the only people we knew who were posturing writing\nAn out speaking and they spoke together and separately and that is likely bill and I did and when I approached Jill I'm I said you know\nIt's kind of unusual inching ever played back as yeah we've always been the example of the unusual and ... that's okay that's okay go find somebody who has the kind of life that you're trying to build\nNow speaking of we've got mothers of preschoolers mobs of course and lots of young moms know that the unfortunate thing if somebody starts dad's a preschool wrestler do [laughter]\nBut I think we all know this is this is kind of always going\nTo be the exception and any time you live a life that's not quite in the mainstream you just have to be more deliberate yeah so this couple that's going to do things I think it can be done they just have to be deliberate about it so I Would encourage them every year they ought to have a goal setting the where they sit down and they say okay this year how we're going to make this work\nAnd they should be prepared to about every seven years life changes and so they should have the big meeting every seven years ago it was a mix of our life look like ... and ... and how do we divided up responsibilities at home so that we're doing what we are strongest in and we're keeping a sense of dignity for the person who's at home taking care of the kids\nAnd as long as they're deliberate about it they can be very successful at this what tends to happen is when people feel like like happened to them\nSort of this this meant feels like I have to stay home if you eventually resented but if he feels like we decided as a team that this is the best way for our family he'll buy into it and he'll have a strong sense of accomplishment\nWhat's interesting is how many women seal like them too and uh I think it's important again for us um you know I think dream my wife is doing the most important thing she can do and that's to raise our two boys you know not alone obviously but you to be there a consistent parents in their life\nWe need to lift that up again and make sure that people feel valued whether your mom at home or your dad at home that you're doing the right thing by or in their lives or you're sharing\nThat role I mean and tied teen parenting working shift hours like there's all kinds of ways to make it work the important thing to do is to sit down and decide to gather what's best for our family\nThis focus on the family broadcast continue in just a moment [noise]\nUsers your phone WG a W dot com and gives you a chance to talk for the sixty one WG a W ...\nThanks for listening to focus on the family and\nLess resume now with the balance of today's program [noise]\nWhat are some of those things that you can do we've talked about you know women and that moment of midlife re evaluation and the vulnerability in fact you set up Pam women are most vulnerable\nWith affairs at that point when they're just feeling like they're not appreciated and all those things what can we do to safeguard our emotions and or\nA decision making two are not allowed that to happen\nIf possible what do we do to put some protection in place\nSo that's like common sense like that to have a date night once a week where we're actually talking and communicating communication dad I give out our schedule and talking about our kids and our goals and praying together\nAnd we call that our love business meeting and we typically have that we work out together and then we go to breakfast and we have this low sit down if things go well we're a little red happened on me in the morning as the kids are off at a at a house you know I'm the second time of the week\nI liked that we've [laughter] favorite reading [laughter] have it and I would say\nIn in response that that the goal of that meeting is to is to find a way to keep our hearts connected\nWith what's probably God's goal to yes because what tends to happen in marriage is we load up life with responsibility\nAnd so over time couples start to evaluate each other based on behavior rather than a connection we have to one another and that becomes a problem in marriage because nobody can be good enough for long enough to meet everybody else's expectations\nAnd so the goal flipping is one several good example of Paul was writing this church and he said you know what's right for me to feel this way about you because I have you on my heart\nAnd that really is the goal of marriage when you keep the emotional connection with one another you tend to go through these transitions together if you lose an emotional connection and then you start to evaluate each other and you find all the deficiencies in each other and so that is really well\nIt was and having that attitude like we're in this together they'll say things when we're in a very stressful situation\nHeld us lean in and I'll say I'd rather be stressed with you\nThan on a hand make with any other woman in Hawaii right now you know I'd rather be I I Will say to bill I'd rather be busy with you that in a convertible with any other rich guy right now so we'll just like try to throw the humor in there and like we're in this together\nUm when things get really bad will just hold hands and well one of us will say\nLet's pray because God will give us some solution or in this together with God and so he will get us out of this he has a way and so we have that attitude\nAnd we do to try to remind ourselves that the trouble is temporary but the memories that come out of them live forever ...\nExactly and you know sometimes it it's those moments of crisis that bring you close together you know mid life transition we talked about well when bills hits I'm it came out it seemed like it came out of nowhere\nWe we were traveling and I and I wasn't feeling well and\nI put it all figured out I think I have a sinus infection so I'm I'm going to go to a doctor in and get the century so I went to a doctor and he looked at me and said bill how long have you had high blood pressure\n... and I looked at him I said I I don't have high blood pressure he said well you do today and that was huge for me because it runs in my family my grandfather died at forty seven of a stroke\nIt was huge for me because it runs in my family my grandfather died at forty seven of a stroke related high blood pressure my dad even though he's alive today he had a stroke and eat at forty eight\nAnd has continued to be impaired physically ever since the ... and I had just decided I wasn't going to participate [laughter] stay in shape eat okay so that just doesn't become a reality in my life and suddenly now it's part of my reality and my goal was to go home see my doctor get it taken care of put it behind me move on\nA well even those guys we like to wrap things up that quickly or we didn't wrap up there quickly it became quite a struggle for me and and I was one of those guys are ... ... with a lot of people have high blood pressure I Can't tell when my blood pressure was that I could feel my joints ache and my eyeballs her\nAnd so I knew and so I was going through this ... going to keep up with all my goals are we going to keep up with my aspirations were few like this and it wasn't going well\nAnd I was praying learned you know I'm praying that bill will be alive the next day I Know the family history here so low stress on my side of the equation praying for my husband um but my heart was drawn closer to him because he's in a crisis right now and I'm then\nI'm right after that little window of time our son got hit in the football game on was um he was in ICU for eight days blood transfusion and all that\nAnd we brought Caleb out of the hospital and um our two boys that I went to bill and I said okay you're not feeling well cabs not feeling well you need to take care of each other because any groceries on the table all go do are speaking engagement the first night\nUm I got a phone call that our son was hit in a football game and um had a concussion and knee injury my ended
