W\nWelcome to focus on the family's weekend broadcast wheel the following program will challenge you and encourage you in your faith journey\nTo be an agent\nOf influence has to be someone who is receiving from God on a daily basis because you won't take the risk if your happiness\nYour sense of security your sense of wellbeing depends on what your husband thinks about you at any given moment I I Would say his desire is for the the woman to become God centered first so that she could really be an agent of his love toward her husband\nGary Thomas has a powerful reminder to wives about how you can positively influence your husband and he's our guest today and focus on family your host is focused president and author gym daily and I'm John ...\nJohn I got a big smile on my face 'cause I think every wife just leaned in to say okay I've been looking for those answers from how it can positively impacted my husband or the next couple of days we're going to cover the topic and it's going to be good\nIt's so easy for us to to get discouraged in their marriages and feel like our spouse is never going to change you know I've been talking to him about this for so long\nBut I think you're really going to be encouraged because Gary is going to lift up some unique ways maybe ways you've never thought of that God would want you to approach this and I'm looking forward to it too because I think we as husbands we want to be all we can be for you wives\nOr but sometimes we needed spelled out for us maybe most of the time maybe all the time you need to spell it out for us I think we're going to be blessed and inspired an educated\nAnd Gary is always a popular guest here he is a best selling author he's a writer in residence and a member of the teaching team at second Baptist church in Houston, Texas and\nHe and his wife Lisa had been married over Thirty years and have three grown children are going to be talking a little bit today about his book loving him well practical advice on influencing your husband and of course we have copies of that at focus on the family dot com slash broadcast\nGary welcome back to focus good to have you as always it's always great to be here Gary this is perhaps the million dollar question I'm not sure I we may have a few million dollar questions in here but is it really possible to change your husband [laughter] let's go there\nI like to use the word influence your husband but we have to put it in the right context at let me put it as a husband with his wife\nIf I Try to turn my wife into a love Gary like he wants to be loved machine that's the height of narcissism but if I Want to influence there so that she becomes all that God has called her to be in Christ\nThat's a holy person says the Christ's love the church and part of that was wanting to make her holy so it is a good desire to see your spouse grow into the person God created them to be\nIt can be an evil desire if you're trying to turn them into that love me like I Want to be loved machine motivation is everything right\nThe difficulty in that though is we are born in this world is selfish creatures that's the nature that we all possess whether your husband or wife so how how do you get to the point where you can over look or uh put us under those selfish attitudes and really look out for the best interest of your spouse\n[noise] [noise]\nThat's the other million dollar question [laughter]\nI think it begins by dreaming with God about who he wants our spouse to be ... so it's not just us but we're sitting at the feet of Jesus insane\nWho do you want him or her to be as a worker as a husband or as a wife as a friend is a son or as a daughter and said how do I participate with what you're already doing in their life\nTo let's go back to the changing versus The Influencing um what is the difference let's be really clear about that what is the attitude of I'm going to change my husband versus the attitude of I'm going to influence them\nUh I don't want a woman to hear this and say okay I just need to focus on myself so\nLet acknowledging that good I ... I interviewed a number of women one of them was a woman that I think a similar type of woman you're describing her husband was so uninvolved at home it was so frustrated he was always fishing\nAnd then shipped talk bases will fishing season is almost over forgetting to tell her that hunting season comes right after fishing season and then he was so involved in war and she was so disappointed she said I\nI'm ashamed to admit this but I found myself praying lord I Hope you'll have an affair or die so there's a biblical way out she saw away for her marriage to be improved or Satan and she was just miserable but as a committed believe she felt like well I don't have a reason to leave his not abusing me he hasn't been unfaithful\nAnd she prayed through it and this will seems severe to some so I just wanted knowledge that as we go in she came up with what she called the magic question and it was a shock she went he came home and she said\nWhat do you want me to do for you that I'm not doing ... she hated asking that question she pushed back with the lord saying he should be asking me that question there are doesn't things he should be doing that he's not\nAnd his answer made or even angrier he said I Want you to be in a better mood when you get home\nAnd she asked me to do more laundry asked me to paint the house asked me to replace the roof don't ask me to be in a better mood if you had in my life you wouldn't be in a better mood either but she realized you know what I make him pay for my frustration every time he comes home I let them know how unhappy I Am how frustrated I Am with everybody\nAnd so she said okay I just got put this in my mind I'm just going to try to do it and she did it and then she asked him again and and he gave her something else that had to do with the kids and it first again she was you're the absent father and you're telling me how to be a better mother but what he said\nWas true and it renewed her relationship with one of her daughters in particular she had a blind spot and that's just what we always have to remember just because their spouse is wrong doesn't make us right you can be wrong in a hundred different direction you can miss a target north south east or west\nBut that doesn't mean because somebody sitting at north you're not missing itself and then what happened\nWhen she began to make those changes her husband came along and he began to change as well I actually just heard from her last week they're celebrating their forty four wedding anniversary\nShe said it's never been\nAnd so it's going back to this that you are the easiest person to change\nThis focus on the family broadcast will continue in just a moment\nWould you wonder why we're so committed to the community remember we're the only locally owned media and ... and we think it matters WG a W College Station Bryan\nExtra listening to focus on the family and\nLet's resume now with the balance of today's program [noise]\nMake sure you get that right it's not what you can do to make me feel better [laughter] so that's important uh Gary women can get frustrated with their husbands or because their husband has something you call functional six of them is\nWhat is it and how does that typically play out in a marriage functional fix it and\nThis I Want to give the credit here to Dr ... he wrote ... she's the one that introduced me to the idea she's seen it with a lot of couples but functional fix it and is in a sentence is this it describes a husband who isn't motivated by your pain\nHe's only motivated by his pain it's a spiritual maturity but here's where wives miss it if they don't understand what's going on they keep expressing their husband this hurts me this frustrates me this is confusing would you please stop doing it and then they're doubly hurt when he knows it hurts her\nAnd he keeps doing it he knows that frustrates Ernie keeps doing it and so she's like I got to find another way to express it how do I help him understand it the challenge isn't that he doesn't get it the challenge is he's not motivated by her pain he's only motivated by his pain now let me say\nA mature godly man would be motivated by his wife's pain\nNot every wife is married to mature godly man his disciples ship if he is a believer it hasn't reached to how he's treating\nHis wife and so it's recognizing that rather than always trying to make them understand that this frustrates me if I Know he's only motivated by his pain I have to start letting him face the consequences\nOf his actions rather than rescuing them for those consequences because he's not going to be motivated if it hurts me he's only going to be motivated if it hurts him\nAnd what does that look like what are appropriate consequences in that context\nIf she's nervous because let's say the family budget is being blown every month or he's got a hobby that's out of control or something\nAnd she's told them you know we're living on credit cards at this point that's not good enough and then she finally says well I guess we have to cancel cable or something then he turns it on and they don't have cable and\nShe's not doing this in a passive aggressive way but saying we agreed and I I Would recommend you setting this up you know you go to a Dave Ramsey seminar or something you agree we're going to live within our means and if we do that just say I didn't know what else to cut or you're serving top Rahman three nights in a row or something but you're just saying\nWe agreed to this and and this is the situation you put me in but you're just realizing OK he's responsible for what he does I still need to be responsible for others and it's letting him face the pain of what he's\nFor others and it's letting him face the pain of what you\nKnow there's a couple of reactions that one is for the woman who feels that it's like I'm raising another child I mean you really putting me in a spot where I've got to give that much thought to this but there's also that passivity that can occur that you know I'd I don't want the conflict I mean so they don't they can't muster the courage I guess it would be\nTo put that pain grip on their husbands to get their point across\nSo ... how 'bout that woman that's a little more passive what would you say to her with a ... peaceful Garry I I mean I'm just sucking it up and it seems to work why is that a destructive attitude\nBecause God created men and women to rule that's clear in the book of genesis is said Mel speaking a male and female that they are to roll their thirty nine active verbs in the first chapter of genesis describing God God is an active got any calls his people to be active\nAnd so it's rather than just being passive and letting things happen you use another example is she's passive\nAnd her husband is saying hurtful things or or even scaring her in because he doesn't know how to end the conflict in a healthy way it's fine for a woman to say I can't talk to you when you're like this\nI'm going to go to the other room when you cool off and we can talk in a healthy constructive way well how this conversation I'm not running away from you I'm not running away from this issue\nBut I Can't talk to you when I'm treated this way or disrespected this way you're just letting them face the consequences if he wants to find out a way to communicate to you he has to figure out a way to communicate that is healthy that's not treating him\nAs a child that's really just treated as adult who's responsible to respond in an adult way\nWell that is really well said Gary this is so good and I'm hopeful that you the listener are benefiting from the conversation I envision you sitting here at the table as we're talking and uh I Hope this is giving you some\nA real good tools to move forward in your marriage because that's our desire and focus on the family that's my desire for my own marriage or that we will be able to\nUm show a are faithful minister Christ inter marriages I don't always do it well I got to confess but uh you know that's part of what we're trying to do here's a quip you to do it so well that it draws people to Christ and because they look at you and say what is happening there that's so good [noise]\nUm for those who are really struggling I mean you might be at that point of separation or maybe even considering divorce some of the examples that Gary has used we have um at least a path for you to consider and that's our hope restored program it's a four day marriage intensive we do that in Branson, Missouri\nAnd it has an incredible post to your success rate of over eighty percent and I'm telling you it's worth your time and worth the money to come and experience that and I hope that if you're in that spot you will call us\nAnd ask for that kind of help your marriage is worth it I I often hear from people that said well it was too far to travel or it was slightly a little bit too much to spend are you kidding me this is your marriage especially\nIf you have children but for all of us\nAnd I hope you'll take advantage of that and we also have other great resources like Gary ... book loving them well which I Want to put in your hands and will do that for a gift of any amount and I'm telling you if you can't afford it just let us know we'll get it into your hands there'll be others who will help us a cover the expense of that\nBut don't look the other way don't be that passive wife who just is going to do the best you can in a marriage that suffocating do something radical to raise it up before the lord\nJim as a pass if I could just jump in I Want to give a ... a passes response to hope restored because I've worked with a lot of marriages and I've found sometimes people say well we tried counseling and it didn't work\nBut if you reach a certain level of your marriage where you're in content or just patterns that you can't get out of when our wheat marital counseling just doesn't work and your past that\nThe same of other people but when I accept that Jesus is the only here on the Bible Jesus only hero today\nI've received grace I'm just so much more likely to give grace and Jim I Know people just what people expect to pass or to say but for me I Can't love my wife and others well if I'm not spending time at the beginning of the day receive an affirmation from God well\nAnd that really does a point test toward the disciplines that allow us to do that and one of the things you encourage women to do is to\nA form their heart towards their husbands through prayer that can be hard to do when you're feeling this emotional separation when you're feeling antagonistic toward your husband I mean really how do I pray for a guy and I really don't like I Know I got to love them but I don't like him right now\nSo speak through that how that is so fundamentally important that you have a time of prayer for your husband just you\nIt doesn't have to be with your husband um probably better if he's not there but ... speak to that discipline and what has gained through prayer for your husband\nFirst let me talk about the danger of prayer if you go into prayer with a list of your husband\nThe danger of prayer if you go into prayer with a list of your husband's weaknesses and spend twenty minutes Iranian God about how this has to change and he's making you miserably you're going to come out of that prayer sick in your heart toward your husband\nThat doesn't really help I'm always mindful when I'm Talking to got about my wife\nI'm Talking about his daughter\nI've never got I have two daughters so powerful to stand up and it was like okay I got I'm I'm Talking about your daughter and I know you love her and you get it but\n... it just changes my attitude and it takes chain on my approach now on the positive and ... and now there's my wife when of her favorite things to be Saturday morning she goes is huge farmers' market and everything's locally sourced than earlier\nDoes there is one either [laughter] and six dollars for a dozen eggs um [laughter] but they're happy chickens right right and they have videos that show that they live happy lives [laughter] so every Friday night I have to go to the\nATM machine and and get cash because\n[laughter] I Walk behind her carrying the food and and and showing up but\nShe takes great joy\nOh here's some grains or here's good healthy meats and and and here's this I mean she just loves gathering all these things because it's what she's going to serve everybody that comes to our house and me and her for the next week\nAnd if we viewed prayer as going to the farmers' market ... lord remind me of this drinks that my spouse has that I've forgotten and and so before I pray for my wife I listen to God about my wife remind me\nOr you know the grace that you've shown to remind me of the evidences of your work in her life and I'm sure like gathering things\nAnd then remind me of wildlife is difficult for her right now helped me see the challenges she faces so I'm going to God not just to change her\nBut to understand her give me the supernatural understanding of why my wife's life is difficult why my wife might be dealing with this one my wife might be facing this\nAnd so then I'm I'm trying to gain God's affection for my wife I'm trying to gain understanding of my wife\nAnd then I can go okay how do I help influence or and a firmer in a positive way\nAnd usually what it means is I've never had God say so these are the five things she needs to change its usually one thing or God says why don't you help her growing this but you're supporting her\nTo move and destruction honey I Want to I I think you've got so much stress unnecessary what if I Do this so that you can have that and so I come to her as one who wants to help her and nurture not with a list of five things that she's failing me she's still in God she's telling her kids and ...\nWhy don't you just retire I mean you'd never say that last word but that's what she hear ...\nGary I'm really intrigued by the what you're saying right there and I'm thinking that four men so much of her life is tied up in work and there are probably a lot of wives who don't hear much about their husbands work there's a whole part of their life that\nIs kind of hidden how can she entered into that as she prays and then just day to day get to know that aspect of his life\nI think just asking God to reveal to her why her husband is the way he is you know so often let let me just use an example there was a Hollywood actor who had so many problems with drugs throughout his career\nAnd I just in a judgmental way I'm like okay you have to work eight weeks a year you make tens of millions of dollars you can go on these great vacations you have\nPeople pay you ... what what is your problem well then when I read his dad introduced him to pot when he was seven years old\nHe was smoking dope with his dad at seven years old I'm like\nOh I mean it doesn't excuse the decisions he makes as an adult but I take a step back and say why are you the way you aren't again\nWhere people's fears are saying that I'm not excusing it but when I understand somebody's pathway then I'm just less judgmental and I have more nurturing because in Christ John Calvin said this I Can't take credit for but it's a great sense once we're in Christ\nGod doesn't treated as a judge he treats us as a physician\nAnd that's the attitude we have to have toward our spouse okay this is wrong and maybe you have cancer because you did this ... you wouldn't say that you would but but you can stop smoking but you're recognizing what led up to this issue in the person's life and then you're saying\nHow do I help you face it you know another thing I Would say with wives on this about husbands not sharing they just need to notice neurologically because I found when I was doing research for this book so many\nOf the most common disagreements between husband and wife aren't disagreements between Jill and Peter or should nice and Antwon\nTheir disagreements between the male brain and the female brain yeah for a male to talk about his frustrations neurologically it's painful it's like\nA it's not even like a deep tissue saw I mean it's like a painful chiropractic thing or a doctor is wrenching something and it hurt for the female brain for whatever reason talking about it receiving empathy is soothing and healing and she feels better\nNow just because something hurts me doesn't mean I shouldn't do it my wife wants to be a part of my world and I have to open\nIt up but it helps or give me a little bit of grace when we do it is the best at the end of the day may be on the weekend maybe on vacation you're trying to figure out things or maybe under certain environment where you can create it but just just have some empathy that it's great that you want to be in his world but if a guy fills grilled\nIt is painful for him neurologically to share with you it doesn't mean that he doesn't\nLove you it doesn't mean doesn't want you in this world you might just be reacting against the pain I flinch if somebody's making me hurt even if\nI don't want to change this focus on the family broadcast will continue in just a moment\nNews or your comments WTO O. W. dot com and gives you a chance to talk of the political will to sixteen twenty W W ...\nThanks for listening to focus on the family\nLet's resume now with the balance of today's program [noise]\nScary I Want to kind of\nKeep going a little deeper in his brain chemistry area because gods created us and it's in that context sometimes we put at war science and biblical truth that I don't think they are or actually I think over time science continues to prove in this material world but the scriptures accurate\nBut it is it's just weird thing that the lord decided okay to make you a little more selfless I'm going to give you two different ways of approaching a problem and it drives this crazy\nRight right here today I Would say and I hope women will take I'm going to try to say this in his gentle waves like [laughter] a gun to the people said most of my book sacred marriage I'm harder on men than Amazon women or whatnot but this is one area where I feel like sometimes women\nAre disappointed with their husbands for being men\nI said you're married a man and God made a man and\nAnd for being men I said I married a man and God made a man and a certain way and this whole notion of nature and nurture\nModern neuroscience has blown that are part of one researchers talked about how\nBetween the third and six months of an unborn baby's life hormones begin to shape the tiny brain ... long before it's nurtured that Mel brain is being hit with the stocks joined in a way the female brain is and and you hit on one that Mr fix it mentality\nWhere men and women just think differently now we men need to learn how to respond or wife's pain in a way that it's more nurturing\nBut I Do think why does need to understand what's going on because they're looking at their husbands as uncaring when in fact their husbands thinking there they are carrying let let me explain this in her brain\nShe expresses empathy by marrying a person's distress and concern because she clicks toward what they called the N n s form of emotional processing what that is is that she shows concerned by marrying it back\nI hear you I understand even ... yes I mean everything within or that's how her brain is registered to express empathy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Focus on the Family", "city": "College Station", "day": "14"}
