[laughter]\nWe ever you'll keep food and he he's a boy\nI was gonna say usually a girl dog or a girl cat I mean it's funny but you went with that you needed some companionship rides or an [laughter]\nWhen you first found out you were going to have a baby you called Jonathan went through to tell him what was he doing at the time this is gonna out you right away yeah but all guys are going to love this what was he doing\nHe was he was golfing okay on the golf course and I called him and you know we weren't planning to get pregnant and we were really just married just a couple of months and so I called them kind of in shock and and I just told him and he's like wow like okay I'll see you and I finished his round\n[laughter] I'm Sorry oh gosh you must love golf [laughter] so how did that make\nYou feel you know I'm One of the golf course early so that that are coming home I think he is at play in the ... what is it\nNow I\nDon't really I remember sitting there on the couch and just thinking like we are so not ready for this it right or at least one of us is not ready for this\nThat's amazing so get payments that picture of the household with girls I mean I've got two boys so John you got a jumping off the list is the extraordinary or but what is that like having four girls run around probably the bathroom fight as a big one bathroom close I'm really anything you can think of that they either share or\n... I think so there may be breathing harder than the other one wants them to at least some emotion and two years and\nIt's a it's a volatile atmosphere\nIt's a good way to the words that positive aspect\nOh it's beautiful beautiful I Love it I Love every day of of loved every day that our parents and my girls but it is it's like living in chaos with four of them I think specifically so yeah there's a lot of fun so you can go from two years to laughter in a matter of seconds\nIn fact it's interesting to your everyday kind of an extreme\nLetting them know that you hear them that you see them that you value them and it's that's difficult for all of us I mean I talk about I think in the book a little bit on this reality like for me I Love listening to radio talk radio conservative talk radio liberal talker I just love listening and just hearing people's perspectives and\nSo it's easy for me to put my ear buds in his own cleaning the house from moving around and just literally to ignore everything that's going on around me and I had to make an intentional or effort to take that you're ... out and just be there in my home you know what I'm doing dishes or when I'm sleeping a floor just they're just being around so I can hear what's going on their lives and aside from presidents and just being intentional\nI think it's tailor made depending on if it's all of our girls are different having four daughters I Know that every girl is different 'cause my four are absolutely different from each other every one of them\nAnd they all received of different ways so just being aware enough about what sparks them or what makes them tick\nUm you know from my oldest daughter she really doesn't need a lot of conversation she likes to be in the room she likes to sit in my lap she likes to you know it's really just being there for my second daughter it's a lot of interaction she's very talkative she wants to tell me about her next genetics moves and show me the gymnastics losing them at me help run an extra ... so\nThere's just this reality that there are different so like if you have more than one daughter it's really you know tell her making what you're doing with each of them based on their personalities and based on what you learned because you are there\nAnd you are aware of what's going on again the point being that critical love connection so they see a father's love and they can understand it and we hear so many of the negative stories where it didn't happen and it causes a a young girl to go off the rails you know and that's a good thing for dads to be responsible for\nAn eye on it and I'm not done it perfect by any stretch and one of the things I really love is having not been a perfect dead\nFor fourteen years are just recently just this week I was looking at um article that somebody did on my twins at their school and they said who is your hero and they said my dad something like All right I'm not doing it perfectly but I'm Still they're heroes yet [laughter] that is\nNow once you're on the mom's side you were a little girl [laughter] so you can share the struggles with them how do you approach in cultivating kind of a spiritual attitude with your daughter's as the mom\nYou know it's interesting because even just going back a little bit to what a giants and was just saying about growing up as a little girl without a dad that was my story I grew up as a little girl without a dad in the home until even\nAs I'm mothering my girls and seen guy do child like I owe a lot over again and so that has been on a neat experience and so when it causes me\nIt's just it's the same thing just being president I'm a little more understanding what the emotions and some things 'cause I remember being fourteen or any number just you know being ten and eleven and and all those things on\nBut really being present listening to them knowing it that like letting them know that they're hurt but then also just\nEven in the emotion bringing them back to a truth so letting them know that their feelings and emotions whatever's going on like\nWe can be there and I can understand but let's go back to what God has to say about what we're dealing with in what we're doing and so just not presidents and being there and pulling back to ... which is so\nGood spending time with your kids yeah [noise] ... let me move to the idea of obedience um I think you know again being a parent a boy's this can be an area that's tough you know this is what we said to do you didn't do it except for\nHow how is that obedience with girls sometimes challenged what does that look like trying to get girls in line because my impression again is that it's much easier 'cause girls listened far better how sure\nAre [laughter] oh why is one of the girls tell me how\nI'm wrong or I'm right\nYeah I Would say if you're at all and I you know I think about children and their ... and like some of our daughters have stronger wills and others so there's a couple of things that when you think about we think about obedience and the first is and what you're always says is like choose your battles wisely like their ... with girls especially there are some things\nThat can just be an emotional it can just go down and down and down and we're battling we find that were battling over something that's really not even it's not a typical issue it's not even really a household standard issue it's just something we have in our head that we want so I just\nTend to think that we choose your battles wisely but then also that we when we see them doing things that would please the harder to God that we tell them that unless you get it for a minute or so yeah just an affirmation as one of the stories in the book dealt with I think getting the girls to bed\n[laughter] they were struggling with that so I was just really relieved to hear that but go ahead what was it was a struggle like thinking about obedience there's actually a story that I just remember very vividly about you know our girls are just struggling to get to bed every night were yelling we're trying all these different methods and winter hurt a method from a friend of hers I Can't quite remember the methodology sure that\nI don't believe in it either I just you know a friend of mine it read this book and she said it really worked when when the kids won't go to bed what you said is mommy and daddy state when we stay up to get work done\nSo if you're not going to bed you need to stay out\nAnd work so we thought like rush try that like let's tell them into you know they wouldn't go to bed and I said you know we used to say we don't want to see we don't want to hear you it's bedtime set up prayers all that and put in a day of course we started hearing people and we've seen in so Johnathan I decided okay I'll Try if we hadn't read the book\nI don't even know what the book was right I just know that I like my friends that worked\nOn her kids and so we thought like okay let's get up put in the works we said OK whoever is not going to bed like you need to get up let's get to work well that already\nIn the works we said OK whoever is not going to bed like you need to get up let's get to work well that already we should have we heard some giggling and some so we should have known right then like let's just stop this this isn't going to work that we didn't\nYou know we thought like let's try it so we started happening you know full laundry somebody to clean up their bathroom and some different things and they were just enjoying it they were having ... o'clock at night and you know we're we're going to stick it out because a friend of mine said that this work and so we as a matter of right\nSo they are just having a great time and I think still you know one of them eventually was like All right I'm going to lay down like I'm done\nAnd then another one was kind of like okay like after that they you know just like I'm going to be what as we were down to like one that ... and I remember which one it was but she just wouldn't and so we lived um\nWe used to have a house that I just the back windows were just open and they were as\nLike a ... it wasn't as far as there was like a main road on the other side but it looks like a forest I kinda right behind the house\nAnd so we were out of things were like what can we help her deal with the already cleaned up all the shooting all this stuff and so John and decide I'm going to put out back and tell her to sweep off like the ... poor rich\nAnd then she went out like midnight like dark and\nAnd so she looked outside and she you know she thought about it for a minute and then she decided like she was going to go in and do that she was not breaking ground she's like I'm I'm there and do it that she stepped outside cameras are strong and yet that was outside and I don't know what happened there she heard a raccoon or hurts them in but she came flying back in the house\n[laughter] we were very efficient but if I were going to show that method alone we're likely next we'll be able to go out and clean the house was [laughter] I might try that\nWinter you mentioned is a while ago but this idea of presidents how did you learn that your daughter's enjoyed your presence\nOut a there's a story I'll never forget that we were at dinner and I'm I'm home full time with the girls and so there are times when you know at dinnertime out just about honestly speaking it's I've had enough like I'm just not in a good place\nI'm tired I like being quiet I you know wait arrest as his head and one of those moods and out you know just details of the day had gotten to me and I'm all in my head in\nThe house even John and John's on the girls they would just excited at dinner it was a good dinner they were happy\nAnd I just thought you know what I'm just going to remove myself from this situation because they're happy I'm not I don't want to interfere with with you know the joy that they got going on so I just got up and stepped and went to the bedroom and I was just in my heart what is it the girls coming down the hall and I braced myself in thought like okay she's going to need something there's some project\nThat needs to be done or something that I didn't get laundry cleaned or whatever and I heard she knocked on the door and I said come on and you know and I just like with any ... and she just stood there and was doing her little little girl thing that they do just kind of bounce in ... and I just looked at it again and I said\nYes and she said\nI just wanted to be with you and I thought like\nThat's it you didn't want anything else I was at my worst thing I just was not in a good movie I wasn't providing or performing or doing anything for her and she still just came in my room because she just wanted to be with me and it just reminded me that that's what our kids need they don't always need out performing school how protection\nOr for us to be teaching them showing them something they just like being with us yeah so sometimes if we let down that guy and just be with him\nNuts a beautiful story and I think a reminder how many moms would love that exchange that they're not there for something but just for them yeah I Know a mother's heart that just must have melted your heart so okay this is good\nIn a sigh of relief because I didn't forget like a project or if you know [laughter] okay\nYou know it's so amazing I think are moms have this incredible capacity to look inward first unlike so many of us men you know they do look insides okay wherever I causes problem or fallen short is just the beautiful aspect\nOf motherhood what a wonderful conversation a winter and Jonathan thank you for giving us the inside\nLook of raising girls in your guys you're still in it you're handling all the four girls at home the twins\nAnd you have done a fabulous job\nI'm Talking about this in your book she is yours trusting God as you raise the girl he gave you and I've got one more question before I ask you right after John ah give some of the details but you know here focus we want to help you be the best parent you can be to have the best marriage you can in Christ\nNot for the sake of just being happy but to be fulfilled in what God is called ... and we're all hitting that in different ways and struggling at times in achieving it\nAt times and uh that is our goal here took quip you we have counselors to help you we have tools and resources in so many things don't be embarrassed if you're struggling call us that's why we're here and ah if you can give a gift to focus to help us do this\nHis face kinda screwed up I I thought it was going to hit me or something and then he burst into tears\nFront of thousands of people these weeping shopping all I could say was no I haven't but I Want to right now it's our time out and we do this okay great so this guy in front of thousands of people repent service in receives Christ forgiveness and baptized him and his wife together so after\nThe service I'm walking down off the platform this other woman I didn't know comes running up to me she rolls around ...\nService I'm walking down off the platform this other woman I didn't know comes running up to me she rolls around through obviously sweeping and sobbing well she can say it's eight\nYears eight years and I said who are you what do you mean ... years sets my brother\nWho use this led to the lord and baptized\nI have been praying for that man for nine or eight long years\nAnd that whole time I've not seen one glimmer of interest in God\nLook what God did today and you're my first thought was there was a woman who was glad she didn't stop praying in year seven who've we stop praying for whoever you stop praying for\nWho is who you love you maybe you went to school with or an old neighbor or family member whoever and you used to live up to God but over time it's almost as if we make the decision for them it's almost like we decide ad is never going to happen and we kind of style and I think that women would say don't give up\nKeep ... keep lifting them up\nYou know I was an atheist for much of my life\nAnd I I was a hard headed hard hearted legal editor of the Chicago Tribune and when my wife became a Christian she met some women at church and she said I don't have any hope for my husband is a hard headed hard hearted illegal letter to trim he's never going to bend is needed Jesus\nAnd this one elderly saying put her arm around her shoulder kind of pulled her to the side said oh Leslie\nNo one is beyond hope and she gave reverse in the Old Testament is equal thirty six twenty six\nBut says moreover I Will give you a new heart and I will put a new spirit within you I Will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a harder flash\nAnd so this whole two years that I spent my life investigating the historical evidence for Jesus and the resurrection and so that whole two years I've devoted to that journey what I never knew was behind the scenes every day my wife was on her knees praying that verse for me\nNo one friends is beyond hope\nNow it's easy to say we had a frame or but I'm On a campaign I'm On a campaign\nAnd it's it's to do something that that we have we've experimented with the church is I've been at in Chicago and in Los Angeles and God has blessed it and I'm trying to get the word out to the country I'd love to see the whole country do this\nLove to see focus kind to lead this charge here's the thing it's easy to say let's pray but what if all of our churches what if we all got together about two months or ten weeks before Christmas this coming Christmas\nAnd we got together and said let's all agreed to pray for one spiritually last friend for one minute at one o'clock every day between now and Christmas\nAnd one of the things the prayers for an opportunity to invite that person to come to Christmas services that the church because we know that if a ... I Believe it's going to go to church going to be on Christmas I mean we have one guy raises and\nCould I prefer to people at two o'clock no no it's always one over achiever in any group no one person one o'clock for one minute and\nYou can't believe what happens when you rally a whole community of believers to do the everybody stops at one o'clock every day and praise for that one minute for the last person second thing I think of Jesus physically lived in my house he would let all the neighbors know my door is always open if you got a question\nGot a doubt that an objection got an issue come in bring some coffee will send a floor we'll talk about it\nI mean I Can't think of any example in the New Testament which is a slam dunk to anybody that came to him with a sincere question than you\nI mean my favorite story about that John the Baptist if anybody should have known with a hundred percent certainty the identity of Jesus being the son of God it was John the Baptist\nHe wants pointed to Jesus is that the whole lamb I got it takes away the sins of the world\nHe baptize she says she saw the heavens open up later in the voice of the father saying this is my son who might well please John the Baptist wants pointed to Jesus and said I have seen and I testify this is the son of God\nBut then what happens he gets arrested he gets thrown in prison question what happens to a lot of us when tough times come\nDoubts begin to flood in don't they\nAnd now he's in prison the doubts are starting to creep in even to John the Baptist now is not a hundred percent sure now he's got some hesitation so what does he do he gets a couple of friends together says look track Jesus down just ask him point blank argue the one we've been waiting for me to wait for somebody else\nSource for instructors us down a Jesus you know John Wiley got busted\nAnd now he's freaking out\nSo would you just tell us point blank are you the one we've been waiting for we to wait for somebody else now here's the thing how does Jesus rare diseases get angry does he say how dare John of up people had the temerity to damage press as a patient about my identity oh\nJesus said those followers of John quote go back to John and tell him what you have seen and heard the blind receive site the lame walked those who have leprosy you're\nCured the debt fear the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor\nNobody's going back to John and tell about the evidence you see with your own eyes that convinces you that I Am the one I claim to be so they go back and they tell job but here's the deal does this now disqualified John from any role in the kingdom of God 'cause he dared to ask a question no\nIn fact this after this incident that Jesus gets up before a group and he says among those born to women there's no one greater than John\nJohn Dowd or\nThis focus on the family broadcast will continue in just a moment and [noise]\nIf you got down to service in Oshkosh than you got us on your smartphone launching loaded radio ... dot com sixteen twenty WG a W College Station Bryan\nNice for listening to focus on the family\nLet's resume now with the balance of today's program [noise]\nFriends it's okay for us just follows that Jesus to ask questions\nAnd we're all told as followers of Jesus\nAnd first beat her three Fifteen or to be prepared to give an answer to anyone who asked us to give the reason for the hope that we have\nBecause so many of our friends have a spiritual sticking point a question that down with an issue in objection that the the holding them up a sticking point in their spiritual journey and if we can help them get resolution of that\nThey can make great progress toward the cross because here's the best news\nWe have a defensible faith we have a face it's not built on wishful thinking make believe legend mythology is based on solid foundation\nOf historical true\nAnd I've seen that demonstrated a thousand times effect my favorite story about that happened when I was one of the pastors in Chicago and and one of the guys who might atheist days it was a friend of mine was the uh national spokesman for American Atheists incorporated so we were friends\nBack when we were atheist but then after I became a Christian course I've tried to talk to them about Jesus and we'd get in these little debates between us and finally one day she said I struggle you Christians are all alike\nWhat do you mean oh you'll give the case for Christ you give the evidence for God but you won't give the evidence against God\nYou give the evidence for God but you won't give the evidence against God\nAnd then let people make up the room I\nI said oh yeah I tell you what you will get the smartest atheist on planet earth and I will fly him here to our church I Want him to stand on our platform and proclaim the case\nFor atheism but I'm going to get a Christian that Christians going to present the case for Christ and then he'll debate your atheist and we'll just let people make up their own minds he said you wouldn't do that I said oh yeah we shook hands on it at very next thought was I\nShould ask the senior pastor if this was okay [laughter]\nTo lay this ball was rolling\nSo that debate begins a weed shows us representative of Christianity a man I consider to be the finest defender of the faith in the world are too weren't PHD's a Dr William Link Craig and many of you know that name I'm sure\nHe gets up he gives the most powerful twenty five minutes ... of the evidence for the existence of God and the truth of Christianity you have ever heard and I wanted to share but I was the moderator I had to be neutral thank you Dr Craig and now the atheist professors ... good luck buddy\nSo this guy that shows their best guy we didn't want to get accused of choosing the bad atheists\nThey chose er best guy\nHe gets up he's about to open his mouth\nBut we didn't tell them one thing not that it would have ... here but we didn't let them know that right where he was standing underneath the platform was a room in that room was feel\nFor the entire two and a half hours of the debate with Christians who are praying that the case for Christ would go out with all this convicting power\nAnd the case for atheism would be recognized for\nThe bankrupt philosophy that it is if you've seen the video this debate is on YouTube you can watch it you know got answered that prayer because we had people vote what's your spiritual conditioned when you come in who won the debate what your spiritual condition as you walk
