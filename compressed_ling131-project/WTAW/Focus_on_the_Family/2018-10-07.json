steps that the child to read from the coffee table the sofa so that that kind of thing\nThat's a good one I remember with Trent uh you know he's just tall kid he was always off the charts so that was a big milestone physically was we'd always go in and he'd be a hundred percent a hundred and five percent oh wow are so proud [laughter] so\nIt was just one of those things parents usually drill into something of those milestones physical spiritual emotional\nAnd uh we're gonna discuss this today with two special guests uh they've written a great book are my kids on track and I'm telling you guys out of our own experience Regina and made this terrific this is the kind of content\nOr that you really need to know that we're generally moving in the right direction there is no perfection that's critical for everybody to hear\nBut these are general observations with your children that you can see where you're maybe I'm a little less successful in you have to lay a little more concentration in that particular area\nThis book in this broadcast today next time we'll help you do that and the book is are my\nKids on track and our guests are sushi golf and David Thomas in or they come to us by

you know and that's so\nFunny because that is kind of the discussion uh in homes the pillow talk between mom and dad I'm sure the girlfriend talk between moms you know what my kids really on track and I love this idea you've written about the twelve emotional social and spiritual milestones your child needs\nTo reach what do you think is one of the most basic of the basic milestones you need to see in a child and about what age\nI Would say for boys I Want to see them moving toward progressing towards ... and we talk a lot about\nHow practice makes progress I Love your statement a little bit earlier about perfection running or not looking for perfection were just looking for progress that they are developing a milestone of vocabulary that they can simply name what it is that they feel\nYou know sometimes I think we don't think that's enough but we don't have that long view of time had as a parent chill when it comes to that to know that okay I've got some time here they don't have to have it all down pat by for you know they're going to learn things of twelve that are different than when they're Seventeen\nSo how do you as a parent how do you dial back a little bit and your intensity\nAs one of the first things we say in fact in the introduction to this book is these milestones are different than the physical milestones where we all know that we want to see that kids are crawling by certain age walking by certain age\nThese are milestones that kids are going to be progressing toward all throughout their lives so you're right no boys going to have mastery of emotional vocabulary by the age of five he'll still be developing that into adult man's we all know some adult men who still need to be developing\nCategory we did it by fifty [laughter] no I'm going to be quiet but um\nTo avoid the pressure to please that if you can achieve that as a parent in your girls that is a milestone in a city that is an incredible achievement how would you go about that just take us all the way through one\nOf the things I talk with parents of girls of all ages about is a combination of kindness and strength and how often\nWe lean towards one or the other that we either just don't have a voice at all and so we don't ever stand up for them to ourselves themselves or were really strong and we have these strong boundaries and were unkind in the midst of that and so teaching girls from the earliest stages to say things like\nI Want to play with you but not when you treat me like that you know how different for a woman that my adult relationships would be if I learned that at night where at ten or at fourteen what that looks like in a friendship I Want to be your friend\nBut I'm not going to continue to hang out with you when you're posting like that about me on social media are when you're relating to me and\nThat really is the strength to be able to say that they feel safe going on there and voice to adult express a\nHow give me a practical example of how you would do that at age eight are you taking your daughter's side if you observe something and say hunting here's a better way to handle that or if she comes in tears because she was overrun by a friend gave me an example of how the CIA players are\nMagic formula we get you over and over our empathy and questions that sounds really hard what do you want to do about that what do you think would help where it's her voice starting to say this is what's going to make a difference and were empowering her rather than when we say I want you to go right back after and you tell her\nShe doesn't get to tell you then all of a sudden we're saying you can't figure it out I'm going to tell you what you need to say if you don't have it inside of you that's really credit we want her to feel like she's got it\nAnd that really is true all the way along that continue on my own age was at the same question let me uh let me ask you this David when it comes to the boy side of that you know these things that we just expressed the pressure to please the pressure to perform the need for control\nWhat's early and a boy's development that would be similar to those things but more boyish one of the first\nAnd biggest obstacles for boys is going to be his hardware and we're kind of back to those differences and\nI talk early on about how emotions for a boy have a lot of physicality to them so it's white toddler age boys are so prone to biding kicking screaming teenage boys are so prone to punching a hole through a wall yelling\nMoving toward disrespect and so part of what I Love to do with boys and parents are boys is helping them understand that's a normal part of how God hardwired you like\nYou need an outlet to channel that intensity that physicality so with toddler age boys for example I have twin boys when my son's for\nThree years of age we we purchased one of those Bozo Bopp it's like an inflatable something was saying in the bottom or you could punch ... felt that it was going to the ground and springs bad yes and it would bounce right back up and\nAnd a part of what's happening and that is is that we're training boys to recognize when our bodies are sending a signal or sirens or alarms are going off inside of us that if I don't channel that physicality in a direction that's constructive or healthy it'll\nCome out sideways this focus on family broadcast continue in just a moment and [noise]\nYou heard the news you heard the sports no weed and review whatever we said we put it on line to sixteen twenty WG a W College Station Bryan\nThanks for listening to focus on the family and\nLet's resume now with the balance of today's program\nSuzie I'm even as we're talking about the description of boys my mind is still wandering back here with the trauma that so many girls especially teen girls are facing today\n'cause ah dad's not a part of their life I mean he may be still part of the family but emotionally not connected when you look at some of those statistics it's horrifying how few fathers are actually really engaged with\nTheir their kids in that regard when you look at the impact on the stumbling blocks the pressure to please the pressure to perform the need for control they seem to be rooted in that relationship with dad or the lack thereof speak to the impact of what can a father do for his daughter\nTo help her be healthier than those three areas\nI think one of the best things a father can do for his daughter is just to have time with her where he is engaged with her emotionally where he's asking her questions where he is communicating to her that he is interested in her there's a\nBook that I Love that talks about basically she saying in the essence of this but how my dad treated me is what I came to expect from the rest of the men in my life right and so to think about that long term what you are communicating to her and\nFrom her earliest stages who you're communicating to her that she is in the way that you respond to her that you validate her is what she's going to believe about ourselves at our deepest core and so how do you validate her\nEmotionally ... validate or spiritually how do you validate her\nIn something that goes so far beyond what she looks like because that's what she can resort to if she's not getting\nBe for land so often is dads and John\nThat's what she can resort to if she's not getting\nIn it for land so often his dad's and John you our father girls need to jump in here my impression would be I can get away with kind of the the job killer teasing with my boys and we can be a bit superficial I don't have a girl\nI Would think when it comes to fathering a girl you have to be very intentional because of the vocabulary David you're talking about earlier have to be a bit more intentional than you would be with the boys and you have to be more thoughtful she's trying to learn from you\nI'm safety it's one of the aspects of your book one of your building blocks that she's feeling safe in the home that's coming from the dead I Would think mostly um how does a father be mindful of that and not just be superficial because my question\nAnd I love that you said that about judging because I have a lot of girls who I think they're ... relationships with their father becomes joking and it becomes sarcastic and and I think she can start to be hurt and not have a way to communicate\nAnd we'd that stink that's relationship right or good right we actually have a great fun relationship\nAnd it's not enough now and she wants to be invested it and I think it gets so much check your towards adolescence because\nThere is this young now I mean with teenagers there's this every night shift that happens where they ... they're a different person when they wake up one morning and in that and I think that largely happens with moms do they pay so much away for moms that with that it's almost like\nThey get so awkward and step army when you've got to have found that it it really is just occurred to them that you're a boy for the first time in their life and they feel really awkward ... and and then what happens is they start to reject their dad or dads get it in and say hey let's go on our Saturday morning date and they say I don't I don't really care ought to be on the town I Want to or whatever\nAnd that pushes the dads buttons 'cause he was rejected right and so then he stops leaning and stops pursuing her for a time when she still is desperately cranking and so that's one of the things I Would encourage dad skipping is to keep pressing\nWell before we leave that subject um that awkwardness was critical to recognize and don't run from it don't figure out how to overcome it really interesting\nTo laugh about it and I think knowledge at and say okay I Know it kind of awkward in these days but I don't want to hang out with your so important to me\nWhen you consider the boys and we're winding down now so we're going to have come back next time and pick this up as you guys are willing but when you look at boys and their interaction with mom what are some things that mom may do that really is apps that little boy\nMoms out there I say this with the greatest respect but one of the first stumbling blocks I talk about is coddling I think there is something so extraordinary and amazing about the relationship between a mom and a boy in fact in the first two stages of his development birth through a\nI talk about how mom is like the center of his universe and he just orbiting around her and and in that it is really easy out of that deep love and that strong connection to do a lot of rescuing coddling with him and said we will observe oftentimes that it's so much more instinctive for moms to be really hard on girls\nReally rescuing with boys and so that's one of the first things I'd say in helping him develop emotionally is\nBeing able to take a step back and allow him to struggle and allow him to fill whether it's the daily ness of homework you know this map is so hard and immediately pulling up a chair and sitting in right behind them and working at all through every problem with them as opposed to\nCity now for a minute helping them get unstuck into getting up and doing something else in the house so that he has that opportunity to work through the heart\nBut a lot of moms are thinking he'll fail if I don't\nDo that [laughter] I Know there's a single mom phase of it I don't inject myself\n[laughter] or even if if it's you know below he's gonna fail it's just it's going to take him twice as long which it probably will cause heat boys are disorganized and there's a lot of elements in that or each ... he's gonna be that much more uncomfortable and I I talk all throughout the emotional development chapters of just\nOne of the most foundational guess we can give a boy is learning to navigate discomfort whether it's ... frustration sadness war whatever it may be one of the greatest gifts moms can give voice to answer your\n... that's wonderful and I love that I'm David in ... we are at the end of our time today and I so appreciate your insights into helping our children better grass these emotional milestones and the next time\nWe want to give you more age appropriate tools and practical ways you can help develop those milestones in your child so he or she can be healthy and relate well to others um you know this program is right at the heart of what we do here at focus on the family we want to help you\nBeing able to say those named telling ourselves in that way and understanding what do I need in response to that like we've talked about empathy and questions and coffee and case though the third\nKind of magical question we talk a lot with parents about his time and space and to be able to say the kids we love you know what\nI'm amped up right now like I'm flooded with worry right now like in this moment\nAmped up right now like I'm flooded with worry right now like in this moment\nI don't feel like I'm In my at with boys that caught your dinosaur brain or you're thinking brain you know your emotional brain you're thinking brain for us as parents to be able to say I'm not I'm not thinking brain right now I Love you too much to argue so I'm going to go take Fifteen minutes to walk the dog\nDo whatever I Need to do at this point and we'll come back together and talk so that I'm not parenting out of fear so then I'm not panning out of emotion when we're emotionally charged kids or adults in those moments it's like what happens when I go to the grocery store on an empty stomach I just I don't make an awful decision\nLet's move to empathy talk about the importance of empathy what empathy is in teaching your child how to express empathy kind of a big question there but we either one who just kick it off\nMaybe ashore definition would be a vocabulary the mountain of vocabulary reading emotions empathy is responding to emotions so it's the ability to kind of look at you and have some sense of\nWhat's going on inside of you climb and do your shoes and we know there's so much research out there that continues to come from that empathy is one of the most foundational ingredients and healthy interpersonal relationships of all kinds\nMarriage relationships parent to child co worker relationship so we don't really need to have much of any conversation about whether we think it's important or useful it is no doubt about it and the research continues to confirm it so\nKind of where we go in the empathy chapter in every chapter is breaking down what are the stumbling blocks for boys with someone blocks for girls were the building blocks for boys building blocks for girls\nAnd then at the end of every chapter is ten practical easy user friendly waves at a parent can be doing this in your home every day\nWell let's go with the boys what are the stumbling blocks have been one of those uh antidote to help them\nOftentimes with boys the first in Vegas it's going to be awareness like where he is\nCovering this all the more difficult to read\nIt on others and so one of the practices I recommend for parents is doing a lot of people studies you know if you're just sitting in a restaurant airport I like what do you think they go over there is feeling what do you think's going on he's talking on the phone having him be able to look and put some of those puzzle pieces together using movies hitting pause at different points on the\nWay watching movies reading books with kids and kind of doing a little ... thing in those moments is a useful practice with a lot of boys\nYeah if you have an older child now and you're feeling I mean I'm I'm not even sure what a red flag would look like if they're not empathizing ah give me an example of practical example where you have a Fifteen sixteen year old and you should be the alarm bell should be going off what would that look like and what can you do\nFor the first things we would say I think for boys and for girls or with adolescents\nAnd this is a part of we're just letting development serve as a backdrop is so important that we acknowledge one of the things that's at play with every adolescent as they're thinking more about themselves and others\nThat five six seven that's kind of normal right it's hard to raise a child at that age to say be empathetic\nAnd it's like Fifteen sixteen\nSeventeen [laughter] I Would hope\nI Hope that they would have more coping skills that point more ability to be able to do that\nThey would but what could get in the way is that reality if I'm thinking so much about myself and I'm insecure and unsteady Indiana myself that I Can't be as aware of you it's not that I don't want to have the skills to but\nI'm so roads blocked by adolescence in this moment that's like a ... my complex in his bed or I don't stand out the way I Want to I had a bad way so I Can't even get outside of that yes and and there's\nYou know for years developmental psychologist have called one of the things that happens in adolescence the imaginary audience this phenomena that kids are believing in all moments I'm being observed critique watched talked about\nAnd that is true yeah media has confirmed that\nTo be the case and so kids are so consumed with that they can't be aware of others in ways that they'll have the capacity to do differently say for example in their twenties and and\nThat feels so foundational to us to talk about it and understand because in those moments you mentioned this earlier a parent could easily go to a place of just thinking oh my goodness he's sixteen and he doesn't have any evidence of empathy\nAnd I would always push back on that and to say he's sixteen and likely doesn't have a lot of evidence and some moments but requiring him to be in situations something as simple as an elderly neighbor on our street lost a spouse so\nLet's run in to that person and take it you found that my son's at Fifteen just found out there the love soccer coach lost his mom and I'm like let's write him a note at this point in practice role play having a conversation a Fifteen year old boy doesn't know naturally\nHow to approach a coach they love and respect and acknowledge that he lost someone you love and that that's that's something we have to practice and that's different than riding a bike which called building block ... and\nI you know that's really interesting to think of it that way 'cause I think sometimes as parents we look at that and of course you should know what that means you should be empathetic and then we get a you know we lack a patience with that child that they don't know how to react but we've got to teach them how to record\nRatings aren't we did I I remember when one of my senses in sixth grade he came home and was aware that one of his best buddies parents are going through a really hard high conflict divorce and he said that\nI Want to check on him but I'm worried if I ask them about it at school and I'm making too sad\nAnd I'm worried if I don't ask him he'll think I don't care and don't we all know that tension as ... for him to ... and that's a great example he didn't instinctively know how to ask the right amount and so we've got to practice those kinds of conversations with kids so they can develop into\nWhat I Love that that the way that you've built the book with the stumbling blocks in the building blocks ... let's go to the girls side of empathy um\nHow's that say on the flip side of David story addict girl dolls working let it was a sense because girls just inherently I think have more empathy from the earliest stages but they lose that in adolescence and she said to me not best friend in ... we talked about everything we share everything\nI think our parents got divorced I should but I'm not really sure says a great picture of a total lack of empathy and her adolescence that that's really normal for her to know that's interesting [noise]\nThis focus on the family broadcast continue in just a moment [noise]\nThey won't call it the fairness doctrine but it's still going to be coming from Roche stay alert stay tuned to rush into Lebanon WG a W College Station Bryan [noise]\nThanks for listening to focus on the family and\nLess resume now with the balance of today's program [noise]\nSee I'm not going to let you off the hook that easy when it comes to the girls though because in the book you talk at length about nurses and now he's think of that as an adult feature 'cause you've lived enough wise you disregard people the whole universe is about you\nAnd it takes a little time to get there I thought that you you subscribe nurses and two young girls that it's a a normal growth pattern tell me what what you're driving at with nurses and\nWell I think it starts typically around the age of Aladdin when they're ... than that now we have girls are starting to pay to jazz eight so you can see strains of it earlier on and it typically bad that junior year they're cycling out of that which is the great and he's\nBack all girls are nurses to stick to some degree like they've talked about they're thinking about themselves perpetually and\nEr nurse assistant to some degree like they've talked about they're thinking about themselves perpetually and they're thinking about what other people are thinking about them and says social media has made that significantly worse because it's in their face all of the time and so\nWith girls I think we want to continue to remind them of who they are in terms of carrying that they're thoughtful of other people that they\nThat relationships matter to them we want to give them opportunities to grow the skills in every way possible and I think again because girls are empathetic more naturally just with their who got to make them to be in that difference like we talked about\nOne of the things that we really look at is I think with all of that we had this language that's happening verbal eat but with girls there's this sub language that goes on that's\nNon verbal that's kind of this under current and\nWhen girls start to miss that we become concerned that there's something more going on such as ADHD ... desert to things that make them start to miss social cues and so they lag behind even farther and does girls are going to have a harder time developing empathy a lot of times\nYeah and in in that context you're wanting to develop awareness and humility right within the ... out as a parent go about developing humility [laughter] I mean I got a couple of ideas for the most appropriate but well I got to be a kind of mindful of how to do that I'm not draconian\nWell and again I think because girls by nature want to offer something of themselves they want to care about other people they have more oxytocin sledding their brains which is\nThe nurturing where men and so how do we get them in places developmentally where they are serving I think that's really a bottom line and so taking them to a soup kitchen to help serve\nTaking them on a mission trips and again with that narcissistic adolescent thing they got going on\nThose years especially important for them to be off and even having experiences away from him away from their parents where they get to feel like they're making a difference because that's one of the places we get most concerned about kids anyway when we talk about depression is those kids start to believe they don't matter right and says how can we give kids", "show_name": "Focus on the
