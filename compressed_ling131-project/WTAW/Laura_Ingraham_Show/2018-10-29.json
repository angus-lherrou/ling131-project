let's go back to that poll that's very very important right now go ahead and repeat what you were saying about that latest poll\nOn poll came out showing that an all time low America's wanted to ban so called assault rifles\nAnd that's after of course we've had a year of unbelievable attacks on assault rifles so to speak ever since the shooting in Florida and the school uh despite all that all the millions and millions of dollars that anti gun groups have spent\nA demonizing those particular firearms along with a you know all the media that that is for the free media that ... that's been attacking them oh for the cold to come out with a like a giant jump in our favor shows the American people are starting to get it\nThere is a U.S news and World Report\nOut on the twenty six article us gun control groups outspending pro gun forces on election let me give some numbers you and I know you know these\nNumbers Alan but I really wanted to comment on this a lot of people will hear this and be very very concerned us gun control advocates outspent by more than forty percent gun rights groups on next month's congressional elections reverse\nForty percent gun rights groups on next month congressional elections reversing the RAs longstanding dominance in spending on gun politics boosted largely by the personal fortune of billionaire Michael Bloomberg who this is referring to of course\n... who was benefiting entirely Democrats according to this ... gun control groups including differs in every town for gun safety of spent twenty point two million on the elections well over the fourteen point once spent on pro gun by pro gun group led by the n._r._a. that's according\nFriday this past friday I went to the federal elections commission now Peter ... executive director of Giffords' says there's definitely a shift it was just a few years ago when people considered get this gun safety\nTo be one of politics is third rails now the opposite is true of course gun safety is math for gun control these people are so dishonest intellectually they can't even tell the truth about what they do less people find out and decide hey I don't want that as that poll Mr ... leave just told us about\nReveals Allen\nShould we be concerned about these numbers\nYeah we definitely need to be concerned about these numbers are numbers mean number of dollars that the uh opponents of gun rights are spending because it's going to impact ballot measures candidates for public office\nAnd you know overall it it has impact public opinion as well when you have more anti commercials running on TV or in a an ad sorry then you'd have program was running for the first time in history over time that there's taken advertising toll\nOr so the bottom line is is that you know we need to worry about that and it's very hard not to get the way for us to compete with it because they're getting money from several billionaires a year where they write a hundred thousand dollar two hundred thousand dollars a million dollar checks\nAnd I just don't have anybody like that and I needed to be in our area really and this is a problem when you get your ... figure out soon\nYou're right and I have and I will say it again publicly I volunteer to be the billionaire that helps I'm working on that I'll let you know how I may go take a listen to this this statement from the un already spokesperson Jennifer Baker is concerned me a little bit\nWhile the gun lobby control is funded by a blank check from uh New York city anti gun billionaire the n._r._a. relies on millions of small donations from working men and women his money is no match\nFor our grass roots organization and the the the lead up to that wasn't NRA spokeswoman said Bloomberg's money would not overturned public support for the second amendment of U.S Constitution which protects the right to keep and bear arms Alan I'm I'm not so sure about that statement\nBecause when you have people you just said coming up behind me younger\nGeneration seen nothing but anti gun crap all day long it begins in the media knows it's why they do it why Bloomberg's knowing it it begins to drive that narrative that guns are bad doesn't it\nYeah and I don't really agree I agree with that statement at all that's why we're seeing here like in Washington state on the initial sixteen thirty nine and I get an issue on the ballot here are grassroots you know you know working with the n._r._a. and set of skills right keep and bear arms has pretty cold for a while before we pulled up and all of us can even with polling data\nOn his anti ... if only to find this week three billionaires one day Michael Bloomberg dumped in six hundred thousand dollars for last minute media by ... to help quote unquote put up with them over the top and I don't have to sort of thousand dollars but in the media by actually compete with it\nSo while we do have the grass roots and we definitely have more grassroots side does those advertising dollars they're still be sixty second TV and radio spots have an impact us particularly on need it the more uninformed voter or the casual voter out here and that's the ... that's a concern so this does have an impact I Can't agree with you on that\nI Wish we had the money to compete and I feel a whole lot said about winning I I'm hoping I graduated is can be strong enough to win on that paper ballot measure but if we don't win is approved is putting its Dallas at both the election\nWhat concerns me about that I agree with you on that statement I'm not real I wasn't it that statement concern me somewhat as I mentioned but here's really why because I didn't I don't want it to create complacency I think statement like that can create some apathy on our side with what we've got the grassroots look what the interests that they're not really worried about it my five bucks is enough\nOr well I I just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about it I that's what concerns me about that and I know the honorary wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people are out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our duff we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance you're let's go now\nTo sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative that six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say\nYou felt better last week and you did this week is unfair statement\nOh yeah that that money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars I I I feel as good as they did last week I don't feel that last minute money coming in from three big donors Bloomberg being one of those\nAnd you know one of the problems we have is we want to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes you can't believe your own rhetoric a and sometimes it it it's better to let people know who they are the battle you know I always say that are done rightfully what election away from extinction and it's really true\nThat it absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes\nS a F joins California group suing riverside county sheriff overseas cw policies this is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights of a legal American resident tell us about this one real quick\nWhat was the sheriff of his decided 'cause California against this may issue says chairs get discretion and what they want to do you say that if you're a legal you know resident who holds a gun you know in in Sacramento a lo and behold you you you can't you know in reverse I can actually say you\nYou can't get a permit to carry it for self protection\nOr we once it's like this all across the country well when the students well a and the sheriff or he pretends to be a pro gun but he he hardly get permits out in his county and he's even ... battle right now\nAnd let's go probably happening he good chance to lose the election and the new sheriff comedian will move to suit for us and we'll win or because those are issues permits or we'll go to ... finish the court battle and loves that the court overturned it\nShare Stanley Smith a sniff is actually pro gun he's pro his gun\nHe's just not pro your gun hopefully all of that comes through out I'm so sorry we ran out of time I could keep you still live three hours you know that thank you sir for everything you do we couldn't be doing any of this without you Alan Gottlieb founder of Second Amendment foundation and the citizens committee for the right

rights in Chicago now this is the first time I've ever had run on the program can't wait to talk to her yeah we're going to talk Chicago at a bunch of other current events stuff to get her opinion but she was a Victor in court against mob politics in Chicago back after this\nIn a lawsuit with Second Amendment foundation and it's what I Know it was a famed case these cases what we refer to us tell us about your correct\nBut I I went to ... ... versus in Chicago we took all the city of Chicago for the right to build gun ranges or the city of Chicago\nDoes not have gone right is available for law abiding citizen and um I got involved\nWith this case post McDonalds um oldest McDonald's along with David calling loss and took all the city of Chicago for the right\nTo own a firearm inside of the home which was a landmark case that went to the United States Supreme court and came out victorious in that case was brought about right after the D.C versus Heller decision\nSo you know as we speak of these cases right now we are celebrating the ten year anniversary of DC versus Heller that ten year anniversary of McDonald versus Chicago as well as the seven year anniversary of ... in Chicago so these cases are\nUm historic so if I was complying with that McDonald's case and I\nWas going to certify for\nThe training their weapon a a ... and I find myself travelling outside of the sea to do so but I completed my I'm training I called my state organization which is the Illinois state Rifle Association to let them know that they that I had to go through all of the red tape\nTo comply with this new ordinance and so we we came to the conclusion that my wife had been violated so along with um\nThe second amendment foundation and the only state Rifle Association and there were several more plaintiffs we took the city of Chicago to court for the right\nTo build gun range is in the city\nAnd city limits because we don't have any range available\nAnd you know I think it's important that we point out the city of Chicago intentionally did that intentionally in an effort or the war the McDonnell decision the McDonald's victory that you were just talking about\nFinally allowing guns in the homes you know a couple of things come to my mind you know we talk about the ten year anniversary of power and then we talk about the ... anniversary of McDonalds and the seventh anniversary of is that I've been on the radio longtime apparently because we were talking about all these cases when they were happening\nAnd I cannot believe it's been that long in particular I cannot believe the result case your case has actually seven years now while it blows my mind\nThe reason the reason being is the when he got the first day three of course the city of Chicago will continue with shenanigans and um there was a ... in Chicago too so we continue to fight 'em and we want on those on that for five because as we\nYou know that the first three they came back with more restrictions and things of that nature so you know the city of Chicago was hell bent on gun ownership here in Chicago for very long time so we have to continue that finally did we beat them at their own game\nAnd all you and boy did you ever and I got to tell you I have been in Bellevue, Washington and Allen's office and I have seen the checks\nAnd signed by ...
