I think it is absolutely essential the job you're doing a certainly this was really really important\nProgram and sort of I Want so we're going to promote your program at every available opportunity [noise] um I you know I'm from the country\nAre there in North west Louisiana grew up\nA shooting guns are riding horses are riding motorcycles you know what I'm saying I have a couple of ... along the way and and actually I began an entertainment career\nAnd music and we've we've continue to do that and and and thank you for mentioning we did have talked to in record by two thousand Thirteen and I've had several things but [noise] back in the early Nineteen nineties Nineteen Ninety Nineteen I Want a we decided\nTo uh put guns on TV because there weren't any\nAnd we I and some other people that that were enthusiastic about\nThe project say wait a minute you know we need to show people how to shoot guns how to how to properly handled guns how to do the place of the gun and our society our culture and that was the original shooting show\nAnd the shows used ...\nAnd we we were up on satellite we were free to cable companies everywhere wound up helping to build a\nA couple of TV networks alone way of radio network or two as well\nAnd and it's just been a real privilege you know a couple of days ago I was at a veterans are gathering in jail\nOr down and to solve and the Mets people used to watch the shows you know so ... we're so thankful for over the years the people that are really hung in there with us because we need more media\nProgram media on TV ... ...\nWell you brought your show was really the precursor\nTo it when we talk let's talk about a mutual friend of ours somebody that you haven't talked to in a while but it's a very very close friend of mine we spoke about off air over the last few days and that's for example Mr Rob Pincus you remember watching Rob show on off from the ... out there in Colorado a number of years ago su I\nYou know you gave birth to this stuff into that genre of television a long time ago and I want people to understand who it is we're talking to hear because it was you who who who are a lot of people look at as the the godfather of that genre of television on outdoor channel and everything else correct\n... well it ... it was due due humility I'm a ... yeah probably yeah uh and and yeah you can\nYou got you got to be careful if you take all the credit you might get all the blame you know what I'm\nSaying you know what I I think with that because when you look at the programming that you put out in the quality of programming that followed you I'd be more than happy to say that I take credit for that if it were me and also to take some of that blame because you were very instrumental\nIn creating that type of television programming in it of course in his splintered off and we now have a number of other different TV shows from that but now now things are changing we're going to get where we've got about another three minutes in in this segment maybe two and a half so let's say that you're moving you did I mean how many how many radio shows you've done thousands thousands\nAnd thousands of radio show where you are done terrestrial radio digital radio that's true of a new music goes motor sports we've have good old time it and you know you and I discussed it is so important what we're doing and and we will talk about this for combat should have something really exciting that you're going to be part of\nAnd all it is going to just add to the mix and you know you talked about the other us photo shows came after us because\nIt's so critical that we have pro gun images because bill electricity polar said hey\nYou know we're surrounded we can find them in a way we go we got 'em right where we want and they came right this time with that [laughter]\nYou know that's that's the truth that's very true statement we're surrounded we've got it right where we wanted we know right\nWhere they are ... you know and and that's and that's pretty much how I think a lot of people feel\nAbout where we are right now at least if you watch the mainstream lame stream lying propaganda media you know they're they're they hate us they've surrounded us and all that stuff but we're fighting our way out of there is no doubt about it we are going to win because I Know you feel like I Do Johnny freedom will always prevail it might be one hell of a battle\nOr a number of battles and it always is a number of battle but nonetheless uh you know I I think freedom always prevail All right so some of the things I Want to cover it with you when we come back we got a lot of ground to cover fortunately my next two segments are are fairly good size segments so we'll be able to spend some time there\nBut you know a real I Want to I Want to cover some of your your shows with you what we're talking about doing down the road want to talk about what tombstones doing down the road very important coming out of tune with the freedom day's coming up in June again I guess that'll be the ... but before I Know there are you in business today are you in tombstone\nOh actually I'm looking over in Mexico as we speak I'm right down on the border\nTo them that we were well but we're actually based out of tombstone and it is\nLike you said one of the most unique places in the world so a historically significant in the development of the Old West and in fact are the the Old West image around the world to stolen his actually bigger than life\nAnd it's all did a lot of uh you know a much to talk about there and and so a ... really it was just such a pleasure to meet you to see you and Allen there oh this past week\nYou know that was a lot of fun and to row into town with Alan Gottlieb was you know\nA ... there's that just added a whole new sense of fun you know as you know actually going to do for you know a quarter of a century because of that has drawn to it and to roll into town with Mr Gottlieb was fun and to know that he sat over there in the wider room at the Larry a motel pendant op read an op ed that was a running\nYou know nationwide in the u._s._a. or later that day was kinda cool on top of a Johnny when we come back from a break I Want to go into all this stuff with you and talk about what you're doing now I also want to talk about your cartridge\nYou know a lot of people

Larry and when we were the right before we were ready to go to the airwaves on Monday This bomb\nAnd uh I don't know if the mayor was there when you got there and not the point that segment with him was just off the hook cool I could've kept him for an hours and talked about all day we hit on you know\nHe's he's ... he's got to tell a friend of mine at a dusty and gold and for that matter and and you're exactly right\nAnd you know what I was so proud this past year and now I'm looking forward you folks get out here for the next freedom days but a dusty stood up for for Arizona and certainly tombstone stood up for the second amendment or in the mark up with a look\nWe're claiming the second amendment say yes or\nNo no ... that he he absolutely did when he read that and we read the proclamation on the show I Believe you're going to hear your I think we're going to hear\nGordon read it in the third our as I as a replay that amazing find our from Tucson but you know that made global news that was it did make news in Tucson that made news all over the world\nWhen when ah when Dustin stood up for the second amendment and Tunisia because tombstone people come there you got this little town of about two thousand people out in the middle of Arizona\nIn what most people say how they even find this place and people from all over the world make the pilgrimage there because of its rich history\nPeople go and show up and that's very very cool now let's talk about the freedom day's coming up in June I'll be there you'll be there Allen will hopefully be they're dependent on his schedule we never know but I'm the freedom days is what\nIs the first ... first of July\nAnd the end of June July and it is celebrating what we have\nHere in our country this so unique and and you know what you're talking about freedom days and and that's because that's the name of muscle ... name was freedom one that's done best for us but but the the point is the American gun or\nActually stands and the way we the American gun on the stand and the way of the global as police state\nIt's us that is literally the armed American citizen you know our country is supposed to be governed from the bottom up from the people to top rather than\nFrom the top down and we the people that are armed we are absolutely the the line of defense for the concept\nOf liberty in war and that's what we're celebrating here and\nI'm hopeful that there'll be some other cities got a quick story\nSo we made it easier just to let you know we got about a minute I think coming up in the segment so go ahead\nOh hurt or you know we had some some folks from up from out of the country people come from all over and there was a lady from North of the U.S border I won't do that without mentioning the specifics but
