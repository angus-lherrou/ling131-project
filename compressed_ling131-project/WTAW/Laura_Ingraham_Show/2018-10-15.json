I've asked mark to sit down we've not met before have we know what you are Arizona citizens defensively yes that makes us brothers and I'm a life member and you say you've been a member now for about two and a half years\nFirst off let's go with a combat veteran you began telling your story fascinating I asked you to sit down and I appreciate it if you tell listeners stormed American radio on two

... welcome back\nInside the armed American radio cross breed holster\nMonster cashed remote studios where I Am live\nFrom Arizona citizens defense lead me to kind of live to tape right experimented with this at the gun rights policy conference a few weeks ago and it works like a champ I'm able to bring you some amazing people that I Would not normally be able to sit down and talk with\nWhich is why we're doing here we are in the valley of Shon it's a little bit rainy but that's okay it's going to be really nice tomorrow and I'm sitting here talking to\nMark down my stroke skipped up make up to you just a little bit closer okay you speak up a little bit louder if you what\nMy name is mark ... combat Vietnam veteran okay more than that I'm\nConservative American patriot\nBut more than that I Believe in God and I'm not ashamed or afraid to say it loud and clear\nNor shows you know or should you and all of this ties together mark yes that was why I'm now I'm keeping your second segment because you are truly living walking breathing American patriot a hero in and I think everybody's eyes so I don't consider myself a hero or do we do those guys never came home but we do and we consider all of you heroes\nAnd I and I know our the excess not you know that's what makes you so humble and I hear that from a lot of people that I talked to a lot of veterans combat veterans will say the same thing that's what's so awesome about you guys and girls just what the what is what makes you guys a cut above the rest in in my eyes\nAbout you guys and girls it's what the what is what makes you guys a cut above the rest in in my eyes in my estimation that very humble ... after what you've gone through is in fact what makes you a hero if that makes any sense from my perspective\nThere's other people that sacrifice for this country the blue silver and gold star families just right the ... will boost our family is their loved ones are in the war\nThe silver star families their loved ones are wounded and they're working to try and get them back into the mainstream of life and the gold star families their loved ones have been killed\nAnd last Sunday in September as gold star mothers day the best kept secret in America it absolutely and I tell the kids you know I asked them idiots could you just say thank you to these families on their day\nYou know given more than they give the ground hogs you know and they don't even at this stage\nThough we're at a point now where\nHistory I've uh I've a Thirteen year old son he's fourteen now just turned fourteen September thirtieth my daughter will be sixteen November second\nAnd these kids I I'm finding that I'm having to teach them things\nThat I learned in school that they're not being taught from my perspective it's entirely different\nIn today's schools but there were dying for I don't even know your kid's only I'm telling you right now they're worth dying for their that import so thin\n... three or four percent of the world's population\nSo they had a Ninety seven percent chance of being born someplace else and they were God put them in this nation and it comes with a non ... and it comes with the responsibility the whole freedom up to stand up for God and country and they don't they need to be taught that it's not they don't get everything for nothing why\nIs why we're sitting here what segue this because this was a short segment unfortunately but why is what we're talking about now\nWhat makes where we are today such a vital part of where we're why are you a member of Arizona citizens defensively and why are you wearing a gun on your hip and fighting for our right to keep and bear arms right now at this table\nBecause the more people that carry the bad guys are more wary\nTrying to do anything they're not going to invade a house in Arizona because everybody carries most people have guns you go to New Jersey most people don't do the bad guys now they're good they can they going to cost a woman\nBecause the chance of her having a gun or zero compared to how many how many women carrying Arizona forget about it so just the fact that you carry isn't it isn't it isn't about that you're going to use the fact that it's there\nAnd it was ... and the freedom and the right this is a state whose history I Love\nI'll be broadcasting from tombstone Arizona live on the Daily Show Monday and Tuesday following this program tomorrow in the day after\nAnd I love it I get out there once a year this is just the history of the state to state was built on the gun it was built on fundamental individual ism as Americans move West is was this was a rugged place even today right I mean this is\nAmerica here and wild wild west you know any ...\nBloomberg knows that he's spending tons of money he's got us he's got a big giant sticker right on Arizona that he doesn't understand of course he doesn't but what we understand the idea that we understand that he wants to take that right from us and easy CDLs at the tip of the spirit fighting for that if he\nThinks that if he could take all the guns away and nobody went to war there wouldn't be in\nWell he he wants he wants to keep his own guns oh sure he needed the guards have guns isn't it ironic that he stands there and talk to you you're shaking your head laughing and I've never met you before jak you understand there is a joke you know Iraq or see here yeah it's not so ridiculous if\nHe spent that time and energy on even helping kids\nInstead of screaming that\nIs going to take our guns away\nWork on helping young people\nWork on helping young people imagine the good he could do with tens and hundreds of millions of dollars that he's spending and trying to take away American writer kid\nA healthy breakfast every morning and that kid got up and could go to school and learn\nThe constitution and the bill of rights and how great America's freedom is and how many people are living in good very good condition\nHe could do far more good but it is and you know at least he's on a path that he wants to take our guns away of his mind\nI Can't stand the guy I make no bones about that every year I think I I find the irony in Michael Bloomberg to be absolutely hilarious if it weren't so dangerous because of the money that he's capable spending I use this analogy\nThis is a guy who wants to take away sugar sodas wants to keep eating bad foods right you're shaking your head also is to actually control you know he's running as a Democrat he was a ... a Republican now he's an independent she this is a guy that has no convictions\nBut don't you find it ironic he stands up on the podium at the New York hot dog eating contest every year while he wants to take away oh you know things that causes obesity while he's introducing when he was mayor anyway well he's introducing folks are going to ... shoved down sixty five hotdogs in ten minutes\nYou know the whole irony of this thing gets me and and so what's what's difficult ... guy\nGo it's a typical rich guy who sings because he made so much money\nHe's so much smarter than everybody else only did was smarter he was smart enough to make more money that will it was well he gave up the guns that surround him when he won let's not never he won't give up anything this security I bet you is security at his house is far greater than most people you've got an army at his house where they can afford it\nBut he thinks because he's that smart Martin and everybody we've got about a fallacy of the the left we've got about a valid or the other Democrat we've got about a minute\n... directly to armed American radio listeners and tell them why it's so important that they stand up and be heard and fight for these rights\nCarry a weapon and when you can carry it in an open area carrying an open area so that everybody can see that um does guns around and the the bad guys can see you and it's not about the good guys seeing you it's about the bad guys seeing how many guns are out there and they got to rethink how they're going to be\nUm frying they're evil and that's the deal the guns in the way and it's supposed to be because good people need to carry them more and more good people mark\nDo my job it was a real pleasure meeting you I was applied on me and I'm Glad I had the opportunity God works in mysterious ways there's a reason you were across the table oh yeah when we were going to the segments I had planned on going directly to Mr got leaving opening this program\nBut guess what where I couldn't I Can't think of a better way to have started it where we bring somebody in here who are you know I can say\nYou got a real ... you got skin in this game brother oh boy\nDo I do right yeah I still have my started amount of stress that I'm dealing with in a war doesn't go away you said that it's been ... years and you ... you just left Vietnam I just got home and last month I got home\nWhile and it's really something and it's um as if it was this morning\nAnd I think believe I Believe that post traumatic stress in a combat veteran is God's way of making sure war will never become a fun sport\nFor well for reasons let's start with the fact that you gave them the grass roots organization of the year why\nWell if you look at the room here and you see what they are pulling off and the number of of you know supporters and members they've got\n... attending turning it in working for gun rights in Arizona you can see why they deserved it aren't very many grass roots groups in the country they can ... full of people if they've got sitting behind us uh their their grassroots work there you know I'm\nYou know they're they're the elbow grease and they put a put down on the pedal to the metal these guys really deserve the award that their their their track record last year was phenomenal and of course they got their work cut out for them this year with the election cycle coming up in this bad we're in Arizona\n... maybe the key battleground state okay who controls the Senate\nBut let's talk about the it is it's it's control it gets battleground it's ground zero in a couple of different areas number one that control the Senate why\nWell obviously this is a Republican held seat right now ah and if they ... it it's a it's intense battle polls showing showing either candidate within the margin of error is the polling data this is one of the two seats the Republicans ... could possibly lose\nA and of course they lose both of them they lose control the Senate and gun rights and we're big trouble in the Senate if that happens in all the nominees for the courts you know go down the tubes are this is ... this is critical so we're really in in the ... probably the key battleground state\nI'm into Arizona Nevada the two big ones\nTouching each other on the map or this is where it is part of the country that the Republicans cannot afford to lose if they want to keep control the Senate\n... there's a lot I could go into here because Arizona when we think of Arizona we think of deep red conservative state we think of gun owning gun loving I'm just goes hand in hand\nWe also know battleground from another angle and that is Michael Bloomberg wants to take this state down this organization that we're sending out here and all of which I'm pro life member of has been working diligently behind the scenes for the last couple of years\nTo put up a preemptive strike if you will across the bow to stop this ballot initiative and they've been pretty successful here legislatively but if we you know I'm going to ask you to are you telling me that they could turn blue\nYet could I mean uh to be honest about the Republicans have been at each other's throats in disarray internal struggles battles see McCain flake and other members of the party or I mean they pretty much ...\nIn in a lot of cases and shot themselves in the foot uh it's it's a really tough state right now for Republicans is that the demographics are changing as well\nWhen you look at the demographic changes as you look at a Republican in fighting a it's a very easy to kick off the seat up it'd be it'd be a horrible off the gun owners nationwide we would\nBe a terrible loss because you're do you would then start to see Arizona senators\nVoting in favor of gun control or not supporting\nPro pro rights movement you know in the Senate sure they come up and say for example if a concealed carry reciprocity which is now showing it to still tables in the Senate\nWell it goes it goes beyond that you have the you know you're a Republican Senate candidate here supports gun rights Democrat ... would ban assault rifles and she I mean there's an a Bloomberg proposal that she wouldn't vote for\nAnd Bloomberg are spending a ton of money in this state yes so this this organization in here which won the award as the grass roots organization of the year how many times now\nI don't know or they may wanna twice or this they they definitely want it this year right now I think they want at once in the past year\nI in fact I Know they have I just don't remember recall when let's put it this way they've got their work cut out for them they've obviously got a very dedicated crew of people here this is not my first rodeo here I've spoke here with this organization throwing three separate occasions\nAnd the room gets for and for every year and it's going to have to be in order to win this fight you agree\nOh most definitely a you know uh I'm really proud to have them as as a graduate
