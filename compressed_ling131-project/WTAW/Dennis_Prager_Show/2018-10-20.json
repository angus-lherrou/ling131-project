forced to go do the money's been home improvement show on top Chrysler stance today is a very exciting show for us because we're coming to you from Jamestown Rhode Island this is the site of the latest\nFor the forty a season of this old house and today in the final day of production we're right here and actually in the garage that it's a lot nicer than that sells the surrounded by the cameras and the saw those to bring you the story of a very cool just completed\nCameras and the sauce to bring in a story of a very ... just completed\nBy the spectacular team at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island is a coastal town that sits just across the Narragansett Bay from Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if it didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt or asked her do you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and many of these houses date from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds when summer visitors built them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches\nBut today many of those dwellings remain on insulated and since they were originally bill just for the summer season there was really no need for insulation back then\nAnd that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt to increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm\nNow to kick things off I'm joined by this old house any contractor Richard drifting we walk and Richard thanks so much sir Richard when we say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because\nThe plan was to make this a net zero house so those are not familiar with ... zeroes kind of explain that there's a bunch of components\nTo one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls in our forty ceilings and [noise] and we made it\nTight tight tight and then on top of it we we did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we we controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to that in a minute right so you got to make the place where the type\nThen you've got to be able to make some electricity so we put Eighteen solar panels on this brilliantly designed garage which just just behind the building away so nobody sees it it's the perfect dangle so it becomes this terrific collector for us and so we could make\nAbout five kilowatts of electricity so\nWe can make electricity were super tight we can make electricity in the last piece to have a really efficient heating and cooling and ventilation system which we we did a and then some and I'll tell you that ... in just a second so the combination of those three pieces is that when the sun is out right\nWe make electricity and we spend the meter backwards back to the utility and then when it's not out at night or and cloudy days we use electricity as we need to for heating and cooling in running the building\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems were one of which was the insulation still talk to me about the installation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support\nYou know the roof load itself right now today's standards with the insulation in the energy codes we've got to make room for insulation or they might say that he's not even a\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like\nClothes so a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building so we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all room on the inside right now they advantage to to adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conducted transfer he also\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finish I I'd had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing ... job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all of the detail and the trims insurance and stuff to talk about uh\nWell uh I give credit to the architect Don Powers who are really just thought about every space in the house and took advantage of his expertise and the design world and and really created a masterful\nA depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be and uh\nYou know all we did was follow his lead in a and execute um but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner and the house\nLos Altos are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with that because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left up to it\nIt really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a so you know a meal to already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um\nThey were right down the road so it eliminated a third party and the middle so it really ... really did work out well\nBut as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home had a lot of work done landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize that part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWell the challenge was it was a short period of time where we had to make a\nThe challenge well the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hearts tape and then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having\nAnd then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout chefs winter the

coming to you today on location from Jamestown Rhode Island the site of the current project on this these forties season of America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys\nWho's a part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda you just keep getting younger don't\nDon't yeah [laughter] well almost thirty five years there wow five thirty six years I mean yeah man it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter] way played hard to get I get well maybe that's it and turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do\nI ... well maybe that's it that way will turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad he had didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy\nTo act on TV and stuff so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefab or fact rebuilt well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and and ... you weren't specifically to things that you did hear that we're it's fascinating to me\nThe foundation first she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation now you know you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought here they bring\nIn ... well pre cast foundation it's insulated it ... it has a concrete reinforced\nSteel reinforced studying it insulated so there's no thermal breaking that in that position and the studs a pre drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast efficient way to put a foundation and\nThat's basically waterproof the same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was back to rebuild as well as soon as this free kept building well\nYou put it together everything's caught on a on a ... so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know put the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that it it essentially makes all the energy it needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see spray foam used to different types of Springfield open\nAnd close close so and then you had sold ... million which are actually I Love that installation I mean I think of it it's it's basically rock writes funding to fight it molten rock radio and and and\nYou it's a great insulation for sounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's where you take the insulation the stone will insulate or you can also use rigid film and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional wall right\nThose are spray foam on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier because you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when you when it meets that different installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study ... and so you got to worry about condensation forming on deep\nInside of the outside insulation is that makes sense though it does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like a um it's it's ... like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation on is like a range Rangel if any any condensation should\nOccur in between that insulation it will run down and not damage the sheet\nAnd but it certainly has to be completely Storm Lee separated ... yeah yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here which are firmly separating everything's in good shape and insulation ... exactly right yeah that's the trick\nNow you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wouldn't shingle roof here now which single root ... if they're not done right and I've seen an awful lot of them and do you have to they write like crazy saver\nI fast if they're not you you have to you have to think of that ... today is not like what you can go it was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get from lumber is really farmed trees\nYounger trees because all the big old tight reign trees are gone you know how the wood will absorb moisture and so on down the line so what you would do years ago you would have what is called skipped sheeting right basically it's like strapping their roof with spacing between it so the air could get underneath the roof shingles\nAnd dry I'm from underneath and from the sun up top\nA wood roof is like a wooden boat it has to get saturated with water as well tied to the joint and then it becomes waterproof yeah\nThe shingle itself is actually ... and if it's laying on cheating without any air under it it rots from the underside out yeah so you have to put some type of a breather", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "city": "College Station", "day": "20"}
