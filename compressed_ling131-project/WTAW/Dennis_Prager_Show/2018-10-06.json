way I look in a lot of ... now that\nWe all practice has that and put all that\nHappens every time it rained between at your house is okay I like I said I asked anyway so at all I don't actually know French Shannon okay in Chicago it [noise] but yeah it definitely can do about that it's pretty I might look around us\nSo first of all you mentioned that you're planning to waterproof your basement if you do this right you probably won't have to do any further water preparing your basement because when you're basements get damp and went as a result of rainfall\nAnd post forming around the foundation that is the source of the week so we can try and who knows ... dry now when you have to you how's that are close together and there's no place for the war to run\nPart of fuel or whatever they do\n[laughter] I thought I landed I think they're flushing the bathrooms on your roof there I don't know what they're doing this in a let me ask you a question\nFor you but this roof on did you take the ... Oh yes of course okay\nNow I'm the old rules did have any ...\nNot really no your home shady\nUh yeah that some shade or in front of the house yeah\nYou get more strict on the front of them\nI just noticed that in front of a little bit right right like above the entrance of the door you know ... but I got like a a by shape how a typo so\nWomen thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roost she right where the would be squeezing solid contact\nThat's a cooler spot than the average they're right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof it's a condition called ... and it's because you get more conversation a in those areas that are cold nearest under Warren's left and right and then\nNow also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or liking or moss\nAnd that can also cost standing on the roof so before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do is use to take a very simple approach is a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget\nIt's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and garden hose onto\nAnd then you could spray the roof down\nAnd just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof that had so much moss on it and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything wrong time so so last summer when I was\nPainting the fence and doing the repairs on so I decided that we take care of that and I got the springs forget\nAnd put it on once and then I walked away for about a month knows that almost all that was going to put no one more time and it's perfectly clean and put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it does that stops the gross from forming\nThink of it in a sort of a weed killer for the moss and it brings the roof and then there's a residual in stays on it and kind of protection the long haul so I Would try\nOr products like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive\nAnd see if that doesn't pay and then if it does and you kinda know what you're dealing with um one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down to teach me try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told folks traumatic trees and and that's should just not white on it because the sunlight is a natural mildew

are as big an corners\nPatterns I've ever seen in my boy\nAnd in the brown spiders ... biggest quarters they sound like brown recluse spiders which can bite so those we don't like it all\nRight but I have tried at about ... by all kind of fat out inside my house our ran outside that they're impossible to get rid off\nSo I hate to say this but have you considered hiring a professional and he probably stayed saving some money but whenever I hear somebody is buying lots and lots of pesticide spraying it inside the house and spring it outside the house I'm kind of the opinion that by the time you do all that you've expose yourself to so much\nAccess pesticide that you would have been better off just having a pro come in because they can buy stuff that you can't buy plus they're specifically trained on where to put the insecticide how much deployed\nAnd also the insects says they're very specific and they were moving the insects that they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects\nThat you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation I Would stop shopping for my own pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the house and once you get the populations down to where they are manageable cutting more normal than you could try to use some of those other\nProducts just on a maintenance bases does that make sense\nIt sure does but here's that here's down the question when everybody else is having the same problem and the mall it's all around the whole entire neighborhood it gets made by and going to help stop at\nWell
