okay [laughter] ...\nWell not fall and then the phone rang you might be finding that between all that patio furniture and lawn mowers an outdoor equipment and anything else you've got for the warm weather season you're running a little tight and outside storage shed can be a great solution and also again why project our\nProject but before you began that there are four important things you have to can hitter and we've got the chips in today's ... project presented and I hope that their dot com\nNow first your average cost to build a shit is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand it depends on the troops choosing whether you're going to build yourself or hire a pro but what do you decide to be a white or not there are several basic questions need to ask you saw before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permit I think a lot of people forget and thanks to my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do this thing or I'm going to put up a fan you can't always just go and do that you have to\nWell the thing I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have to check your local building codes first to determine if you need a permit to build a shed on your property now you don't want to find out after\nYou finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated them building code orange zoning code\nI mean that's the last thing you want to do it and death a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what size does your shedding bam what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for just business needs putting nothing then they're not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something decorative\nThere are so many different styles and sizes out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that and that you can determine the style for what your sheds going to be\nYeah and part of that as a society where the shit is going to go I mean depending on the size of your property you get a lot of different options for the placement that should know folks very calmly might put it close to the house which makes running power in ... or\nSometimes folks will tuck it sort of to the side of the back of the property so that it's less obvious but put some thought into that because you're gonna be going back and forth on what you want to regret that decision\nAnd finally what your budget I mean did you get a tight budget you can build a very simple should that gets the job done without a lot of frills\nBut it's got some wiggle room you could think about ending some extra features like integrated shelving inside decorative trim on the outside or you could go all out man cave or she shed and maybe at electricity\nHeat plumbing wall to wall stereo I don't know you know you can really totally decked out those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting estimates from at least two or three contractors before you choose the one pro that's going to help you with the project and I said from project\nPresented by advisor dot com went home and buy their you can get matched with top rated homes service probably in your area we verified reviews and appointments on mine all for free\nNo matter the type of job home advisor makes advanced in easy to her the best local approach\nNow got cancer Adelphi on the line was looking for a better shot or\nWe say um Hi I'm calling because I wanted to find out um I had an old Victorian house and I had a three three three\nI had a ... ... and when it wasn't a shower the second floor and then I Want a shower or when the water up the are going to work or the shower go with coke and I've been ... contractors and my former and I'm not getting any answer so I like to remedy that as I'm do remodeling\nOkay so are you opening up walls is part of the remodeling\nYes I Am completely stripped down to the\nOkay great so first of all the reasons you have reduced water pressure an older homes are generally because you are old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they clog the closed down like a clogged arteries and then you can't push enough water through it\nAnd that could be your main water pipe it could be the supply pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls are part of the general rule of thumb is whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um war with pets was different newer type of plumbing pipe\nNow you're a thing as you may have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nWell one of the pressure is not that big of a deal because I think the pressure on okay it's just that like basically we have to bear on them out and you can only use one at a time by the water completely ... if you're in a shower somebody on than eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying the hot water may not be moving into hot water which I was worried or do you have\nUm forty gallons or was a minimum size but should be okay for for two bathrooms okay and is it an older water heater\nUm no I just worked like or to hear\nWhen you were placed into the changing the plumbing around it this is going through the steel pipes\nI did they change the hike around the no I don't think\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's contributing to problem and you know with the water pressure is at the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something on line called a um a pressure balance now where there were many issue at all\nSo pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does it keeps them mixed between hot and cold balanced so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and now Robert hot water from the upstairs shower\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of a stream but it wouldn't be the temperature would change okay right okay no that's not as though I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have\nSomething you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not going to hold on a second floor just don't think you're moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do with them a check up piping around the water heater\nA plumber should know this not only run the water heater with basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help groups are up to help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always get a second water heater upstairs you could give it a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it would supply additional water that second for about\nOh okay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll right thanks
