Bryan [noise]\nRelationship at three thirty seven under the triple a fisherman three those could achieve J I decided to hold them and go ahead DJ younger\nAnd I know I was gonna say what a basically what you're addressing here and rightfully so to deplore the actions that take place here on the micro level this is what happens because the republic is dead and it's been dead for quite some time and it predates the election of Donald Trump\nAnd it's the result of that and the fact that the government exists only in in ... states following the cool perpetrated by Mitch McConnell back in twenty five or six teams was it yeah twenty sixteen\nOr twenty Seventeen rather when a way that no twenty fifty and I'm Sorry when he ... he uh decided that he would singlehandedly with a minimal majority decide to take control of the last institution that we had integrity and faith\nAnd which is the Supreme Court because the\nPsycho drama is only a result of the frustration because the Democrats who are the only main opposition to anything that occurs at that level\nFailed to address what had occurred and now all that energy all that anger all that hatred is now translating it trickling down into the lower levels of the micro\nWell of course but the thing is is what I really don't understand is that I I and I beginning to I I was beginning to look at this and say to myself\nLook what we have here is we have fragmented portions within a country fighting against one another this isn't about one group against another group was about several groups wanting a piece of the action and that's why I think when you have that many groups want to see action in the fight we are in we're in a part of the civil war we really are\nNo no we are this this is what's gonna happen because white now it seems that because I'm disappointed disgusted interjected by the fact\nThat it would appear the Democrats at least right now are willing to allow this to occur at not to get their hands dirty and I'm questioning what is going on in the Senate level because I hear stories from\nOther radio shows more you know the mainstream type so I can say that you believe it or not a little more mainstream that you might like to be hearing these say but\nAlong those lines where they said Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer are getting together and even though they have the fifty one vote threshold that judicial appointments that are being shoved through one after another after another um he does have a a place at the table with it and I'm Wondering what is going on here rather\nThan go out and you just it just seems like it's by design and like I said if if we look at the center in the mid term and we find the Republicans hold the holder a majority in the Senate I like you know with the next tipping points going to be ... I'd like you know what the next ... are going to be\nHarkening back to your very first caller I'm a person who goes around and have been saying now for three years that I consider the Supreme Court deal legitimize because while I can I meant to you politicizing\nThe court you can never make it partisan political because the integrity of the faith and the judiciary was the last the institution\nEvery everything's been radicalized everything's being radicalized CJ that's the whole point\nWell that's it but you didn't have to go this\nFar and that's what I don't understand it and it seems like there's this collusion between the two of them on a new because there's nobody complaining about anything here and like I said I don't I don't know I don't like Donald Trump but I Know I Can't I cannot blame this on him I have to blame it\nOn the Machiavellian machinations of Senator McConnell and when he was the only around complaining and ... and the ... uh the loaning obstructionism and changing goal post in that long winded speech he gave\nI was sitting here waiting for the very words to choke have after everything that at a\n... right right right well I mean we'll see what happens after the midterms and it's going to continue the midterms and then we really see the gloves come up I think that's something that will have to be prepared for it it's going to patch in Illinois Hi patch or on ground zero\n[noise] how you doing I'm I'm very a nervous some try to do is um [noise] I understand and I've seen a witness to a lot of things that happen to hear what you're gonna feel like you got justice if they settle where you went in court you don't understand they don't\nCare if not their money you don't understand when it unlimited leaving understand news you don't understand you actually get caught at it you hatch patch you don't understand the situation\nMy wife has a place in law enforcement in in public safety she has a job in law enforcement public safety okay I understand she identified herself and still was abused\nI understand it so I don't care when I've been around these people I also work for the state of Illinois\nOkay I reported thing ... nothing was done except for I was an act of ... um you have to you had a hit and target the actual you had to be able to target and sue the officer is what we're\nDealing with it in a lot of ways are not just you know we got a lawyer just in case we're doing going with it a lot of ways we're not going to be a you know we're not nasty to the police there's no way you're going to be nasty places especially when my wife has to work around police officers\nIt's it's just something that I I didn't know who the officer was what he thought he was doing his body was messing with\nBut you know when you have a public safety officer in the area who was involved with very command and those people that come in and and she states that and says hey you know EMT a there needs to be an EMT here because the guys in pain and the guy decides who the hell are you to tell me\nThat's when it gets ugly and that's what happened so no I don't believe for one minute there's going to be any enemies here because I think Janine smart enough to understand what's going on here I mean it's not going to be like\nYou know it's not like most people I mean you know when we when it was first heard about the number of people\nGood police officers were their tobacco ... and there were plenty of police officers are there to back up and I'm sure we're not going to name the guy's name when I'm going to say it happened\nAnd there are a lot of good officers but no but it's nice to be taken care of so that's how it goes there are good officers out there to really fix him and three thirty seven hundred in Tripoli Seventy three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\nTime [noise]\nMine [noise]\nLet her know that anybody who sit there and encourage this type of\nSaving encouraging this type yeah or\nYou know it made it to the media doesn't too they encourage you to\nWell I I think it could lead to assassinations because if you look in our past a remember we used to have abortion doctors that were assassinated mhm and and this is the level of hatred that we're at right now\nThat it you know if you're confronting somebody in a restaurant or at their home who's to say that they don't have a gun\nAnd they're not going to assassinate somebody\nWell yeah that's the point you see that that that's the moment they're waiting for their waiting for the moment where somebody has a gun and shoot somebody who harasses them telling them that they can go one way in a car you know they're waiting for that moment there waiting for that moment and say no ah I'm turning left my gun says I'm turning left\nAnd shooting three or four people blocking my car since then I can go forward and not backward\nWell actually uh tonight on Tucker Carlson he led with the film footage of what's going on in Portland\nYeah I Know and when did you think of that did you see it\nI saw exactly what you're talking\nAbout bears to be I'm embarrassed to be in the city because of that because our mayor won't do a damn thing about our police don't act but they'll do they'll do other things including you know harm my wife because she was\nDoing her ... she was standing away from the officer let me ask you do is work she said who she was and then she said by the way I Believe this man needs an EMT just saying and and he got angry and hitter he said oh I was reaching for my radio\nWell I Hope in regards to your wife that um you said you have an attorney um I Hope the arrangement that you have with your attorney is that he's taking this on a contingency basis both on his face and his claws\nWell I I did this is it in my view doing ... doing it she has like I said her position she she works in public safety and I'm only giving the barebones thing I'm not telling the whole thing but she does that so she knows exactly how the she knows how the courts work she knows everything about the court\nYeah so um I think a lot of people don't realize that if you're um a ... if you're a Supreme Court justice\nA member of Trump's cabinet or a senator or a member of the house representatives you don't have security if you notice when these people that when you see the footage and these people being in front of it they don't have security\nThe only a handful have security if you're in a leadership position right speaker of the house where justice right but the other justices\nCabinet members senators house representatives they don't have security I think they should have security because they tell you somebody is going to get shot at\nWell rice and does it need security does it come at rice and went out they could have gotten to the president could have gotten to the joint chiefs of could have gotten to Ted Cruz\nWell some things are a lot harder to protest and others so of course rice and going through the mail system is is very difficult to protect against\nRight it's really hard and then see that's the thing about\nClyde how it comes down to you and me and your listeners\nI wouldn't be very reluctant this political season to put a bumper sticker on my car or a sign in front of my house because I think you're leaving yourself open to get vandalized either having your car vandalized like skiing or having your house vandalized can or yeah he doesn't like your politic\nWell that's the thing that's how radical we become the idea of radicalization if the radicalization has not proved that we're in a civil war right now I don't know what will the idea that you can't express yourself\nBy having a political view either way\nAnd having someone come in and say I don't like his political view I mean the key is car for I don't like his political view I'm going to spit in his pizza\nThese are the things that are going on in this country right now and and this is evident I mean if you want to bring physical harm to people regardless of who you are you in uniform out of uniform whether or not you're wearing a mask on the street with a baseball bat if you want to bring harm to people you're participating in a civil war\nSo here's here's what I think could happen\nAnd you remember I started off by saying that we're\nWe're in a unconventional civil war as compared to our first civil war but you could see\nThis situation growing and growing and escalating violence so that we are some time in the future in a civil war that looks like our first silver or you could easily have red states that gets ...\nBut that's not what it is hoping warfare is not what it is because it was that that you would have to you you have to take into consideration all of the groups have been organized we've only black lives matter\nMe to a separatist groups ah you know a patriot prayer Proud Boys you know I I Am trying to go down the list of all these groups that want to be heard\nRight and I think for a lot of these groups are tend to identify either with the left or the right leaning Democrats or Republicans\nNot always I always\nThat I'm just saying that let's leave open the possibility that in the future of the civil war could escalate into something much more violent than it is now\nRight all out war between people yeah a purge when I'm trying to talk about their you know\nYou could see you could see that the military get involved um yeah of course it's getting involved\nLike South America exactly what it is going to happen in South America jak things for the call Tony\nAmerica exactly what it is going to happen in South America jak thanks for the call go to Tony in Texas Hi Tony you're on ground zero\nQuite I'm enjoying your show tonight I spoke to a couple of months ago and I mentioned that my family my mother and father were in Argentine at the same time that you were\n... and I think it's very difficult for you and I because you know we know what happened there with the facts and ... what are people\nIn America don't understand is that\nAll of these different groups if a civil war situation breaks down and there's not a um\nThere's not a a a police force or ... or civil order what you have also are within factions individuals settling vendetta mhm okay\nThat it just goes from bad to worse now my father's family I didn't say this before but you'll understand the insinuation here my father's family or German\n... ... now\nThe ... in in Argentina it was amazing how the police were uh they wouldn't do retribution strikes that were very very similar to what the guest stop Bo did in Nazi Germany wasn't that amazing that occurred\nAlso amazing how they were rounding up Jews as well do you find that amazing that they were doing that is that and is it interesting that Mr burglar was part of that and these are pope now isn't that amazing\nWell I ... I I'd been sanctioned for criticizing the Holy Father obviously I'm Roman Catholic so I Will say Jesuit\nA life of my family was not very fond of the Jesuit and you notice that a certain Jesuit turned out his own people and that and the floods came in and killed a lot of names as a result of that\nOh yeah yeah we don't want to talk about that do the Tony but yeah the ... the death squads killed nuns and priests under his direction but no one talks about back were just so happy that he's pope now\nWell I'll tell you the people in America this is very important what you're talking about tonight um I well I'm going to say something and you may disagree I Would hope that perhaps\nThe national guard would be called the sooner than later so that it doesn't get out of hand especially in states on the left coast\nWell you you watch what happens during the midterms there'll be a lot of security I'll bet there'll be a lot of dirty in the\nFinal thing wide I don't know if you're aware of this but Sen Cruz is not going to be harassed much longer because the governor of our state governor Abbott\nGets patched it details the Texas Rangers to protect our senators and I don't know if the American people know that the Texas Rangers are but there is there going to be anybody hollering it either of our two senators on another occasion\nWell that that makes sense that they call those in because I don't know why Sen Cruz was targeted targeted for the ah rice\nAnd in fact that that really raises a lot of red flags there I think and I don't like Ted Cruz section\nOf the matter bargains like [laughter]\nI'm just saying I just think it's wrong that they said right syndrome I don't I don't know who's going to be done a bad bad to deserve that type of treatment from anybody and and that's the thing is that you know you don't necessarily like the politics that doesn't mean you have to act like an emotional zombie just because you don't like a certain individual that was the\nLeader on Argentine in the United states doing quiet and you don't do that\nNow we don't you try to tell people they can't believe that it actually happened and he did and it's happening again you're in the United states because the people are involved Henry Kissinger ladies and gentlemen thank you so much Tony talk to you later already by by Tripoli six Seventy three thirty seven hundred the history of relief except at three thirty seven hundred will be back\n[noise]\nThis online banks for closing down the even more barking when I signed for home equity loan only I didn't what\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on line where thieves foreign and domestic hack them it's simple the Ford your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "10"}
