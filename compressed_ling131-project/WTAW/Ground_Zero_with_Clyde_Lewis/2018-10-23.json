chickens in the news today [noise]\nActually it's a sea cucumbers [noise]\nBut ah I was so blown away by the same because I'm I'm I'm just terrified of chicken and as I said earlier there's a actually a legendary they call it a legendary chicken ran that I did a one\nTime I was on the air some guy was calling because I was talking about fear and it was a Halloween ... or after Halloween party I was on the you're talking about fear and I said one of my biggest fears with chickens I talked about this guy calls me he tells me he says well you know if you\nKill a chicken you know if you kill yourself in your pocket yourself you'll be overcoming your fear because then you'll know that you could you can conquer it and I thought now telling me this story about how he killed a chicken and and everything it just made my skin crawl okay\nSo we think about that floating headless chicken that they found out that Antarctica it's not really have a chicken they call the sea cucumber looks like a floating chicken\nBut anyway so I'm Talking to the guy and I told her I said no no no no this is creeping me I don't even go there don't talk about executing chickens don't talk about ... shopping chickens and having their heads chopped up running around squat you don't do the debt and don't do it so it kept doing it and I just got off of a Halloween party I wasn't drunk but I was you know how it is when you're just bugs\nAnd you're capable of doing things and your heads kinda cloudy it was how I was feeling 'cause I was just coming off I figured I'd be fined by the time I get on the air is still feeling a little bit you know one of those if I Do a few cups of coffee I'll be fine and so I was doing slowed down the copy the guy called the show here is a bit\nFrom the legendary chicken ran just to show you a where my head was at the time All right I'm creep\nThat's creepy he got over his sphere by by just\nNo you can't do that\nBeing an executioner of chickens does not change your fear no it does not\nIt does not change the fact that these things they are ruthless\nThey package you\nThey go they make that that clicking sound this just hideous you can you imagine you imagine being held in a chicken coop\nFor a long period of time hearing the sounds of clocking every day and scratching and pecking\nThat would drive me nuts\nThat's how would knowing chickens are\nThat's why we put them in buckets they will use eleven herbs and spices on them because they're scary\nWhen you had all these people out of the old airport defenseless chickens no one attack me when I was a little kid there not defenseless\nThey're not defenseless\nPoultry what they are\nFrightening foul is what they are\nAnd they do fly you know that they do okay don't let anybody tell you different chickens fly they just don't like to fly obviously they're lazy good for nothing chickens and they only fly when they need to\nThey only fly when they want to pay issue off the only fly where they want to scare the hell out of you\nHow one coming down slipping down on you and flying as they jump off the coup on to you that is when they decide to fly chickens fly\nAnd they attacked children they're worse than\nThere were those damn dogs those pit bull dogs are worse than pit bulls\nTo keep your chicken under lock and key\nFive oh three five three five and ... back in the old days when the yo ... I was younger okay and ground zero was you know it it's infancy\nAnd like I said I went to a party and this guy just you know he calls me and he starts talking about how it could be my fear of chickens eat that I had to kill it nah I went into this chicken rant and people are like going I recorded bath [laughter]\nBut he's sending me this this chicken dictionary chicken they should I call that those chicken necks\nSo uh anyway so that's my right about chickens once again they found this they found the sea cucumber because the cucumber of all things actually swimming off of Antarctica or Australian group founded put on video it looks like a flying\nI like swimming headless chicken and I was watching it today gave me the creeps I thought my God you know there are plenty of creatures that we don't know about and the scary and they're out there and they're freaky All right so a especially a chicken with its head chopped up man nothing worse than that [noise]\nAnyway a mouse ended up a chicken ran a very rare I pull out the chicken rent but I pulled it out there so you can see that yes in my younger days there's a reason why I was in the national talk show host\n[laughter]\nGenerally think Seventy three thirty seven hundred [noise] been dribbling fix every three forty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\nYeah that's what I think too it's another lifetime thank God I can uh you know lead you to have a Chicken Little Evan herbs and spices\nHuh [laughter] [laughter] you're way or rather strict parents ... ... as bad as okay with the feathers and Eighteenth I Do it All right Tony man you made my nightmare thank you appreciate it\nYou know and that's the thing that I I was I was studying practical joker show and one of those guys on the show has a fear of cats I don't get it you know I mean I'm sure people don't get my fear of chickens but I I Do I have I have if you're at and you just heard what he said you've heard what you said about you know\nJason what your blood all over us would come in and we thought they were actually that's exactly what they are they bleed everywhere and they chase you\nAnd and and and I actually someone actually sent me something once\nIt was terrifying thing I ever saw it was a chicken Parker\nAnd what it looked like it like a washing machine it was like he took the chicken and you put it like you to spin cycling what was done it was parked it always lumped with his with his feet and it's ... it's blocked\nWasn't chicken Parker and I'm thinking oh so that's where you know washing machines are certainly chicken blockers okay I didn't want to do a whole show about chickens but\nUh I just want you to know that the idea of the headless chicken monster caught on camera\nIs the most terrifying thing floating in the waters off of Antarctica\nOkay you know\nAnd you know this reminds me of and this is what I really want to get into tonight because it's like Halloween has got to you know chicken scare me anyway you just heard the story about you know hunting down chickens have been bleeding all over you say some horror film\nBut ah you know this whole idea of the headless chicken monster that's what scientists are calling it even though it does have a a stage name ... one of the name sounds like at the skin disease\nDid you see the ... floating around in the water or her or you know and that that is but anyway scientists\nScientist suggest that a\nSecond genesis to place\nIn its infancy where there is a fifty percent chance\nOther life forms which opposed the norm do exist\nThey hide within the normal biosphere\nNow I Know this is a radical hypothesis and the very high brow way of declaring that\nThere was a twilight zone\nSeriously\nSay well this is science is limited to the study of a mirror world with different microbial things in different\nPriya Demick creatures that may exist that made this turn up out of nowhere why don't we just stop with microbial sciences why don't we just stop with a you know these things that are hidden you know they ...\nThis is beyond the cryptic thing when you when you talk about mafia than we can talk about big for it we can talk about you but cob or we can talk about all those things\nBut it's been many years\nSince\nI've discussed with my audience the reality of what can be called\nThe second genesis\nAnd it's a theory that when the earth was created\nThere was the story did we learn from our bibles\nAnd through science however there is this hypothesis that another genesis took place beside our own in another dimension\nNow from there it's proposed that there was a form of multiplicity\nAnd the creation and the multiverse city\nThe agents called it\nThe underworld course and others are called to the abyss and in the TV show stranger things it was called the upside down\nNow the timeline of creation immigration miss it we adhere to\nAre the ones that have been handed down through millennia each one is unique in its interpretation however it's basically the same concept\nAnd it's from these creation myth\nWe hear of gods and monsters were upon the earth in its infancy\nAnd some of the monsters the ancient passed since died out they want some have survived that are still considered predatory and dangerous\nSome like the shark and the alligators and crocodile zero\nConsidered prehistoric and of course remember we talked about the mega lived on whether or not they think that Michael or don't exist but anyway recently there have been numerous reports and discoveries that indicate that there is in fact\nAn active shadow biosphere that exists in the same time dimension\nAs the one we see in living from day to day\nWhile scientists speculate that strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet if it isn't a very far jump\nTo suggest that stranger life exist on the planet and and that when you blow open the shadow biosphere\nTheir lurks every monster and violence thing\nWants to ever come in contact with\nWhat I'm Talking about is not big for it it's not the Loch ness monsters\nIt's beyond my man fight with monsters beyond that you become a bra and he's been cited by many people and so far they're identified by some of their well reported trades mean big puts a big hairy creature that walks around and then you have you know the mock man big red eyes in the wings and you have the ... you know various ideas of what's\nGoing to be seated dog or it has ... it sucks the blood out of you know cheap you know\nIt has certain traits\nBut what if you come upon something that\nNo one has seen before annoys her up like this\nHeadless chicken floating in the water swims you know I looked I didn't even know what the hell was that it scared me because it looked like a headless chicken swimming in water but it was a sea cucumber home names\nBut if you didn't know\nWhat a sea cucumber was you can do so they wonder why is this thing\nSo\nWhen I'm Talking about\nAre creatures that have appeared where you've seen\nThe do not fit\nCreatures they've come from somewhere\n[laughter] but they certainly don't belong here\nAt least so we know\nI saw something today\nWish I would have saved because it was a big besides the chicken or something and I swear it was a familiar in little knots and then I thought it was an armadillo but it wasn't it was some sort of a a a snake ish looking character with armored scales that was actually ripping apart\nSneaky looking character with armored scales that was actually ripping apart the foundation of a house\nAnd somebody said oh that's one of those things I'm going well didn't look anything like a C ... it'd be a senior and it was the second one I saw\nIt with the idea that ah you know something bizarre when he was trying to Komen someone's trying to come and move on to the other in the room with her\n[noise] nice doesn't always happen always get post on there\nAre going to turn them when I didn't know I was charging it earlier that's why it's kinda scary in the middle of something funny\nIs make sure that anyway\n[noise] so uh where was I okay I'm Talking about creatures that don't necessarily fit the mold and what I mean by that is is have you ever seen anything\nThat it's not a big foot\nNone of big foot none of my men now ... you don't know would have held it is and could you describe it for me\nI've been thinking a lot about second genesis since I saw this creature today\nAnd its other creature to I got to find that at the creature I'm obsessed\nBut ah [noise] and I had somebody else will send me a pick some as in rock\nBand really cool rock band and guess who wrote me I got to look this up to playing and all of these CEOs reptilian creature like behind them and there's no reason for it to be there's no rhyme or reason to be\n[noise] and uh\nAnd then coming up in the next hour [noise] at a woman named Barbie who I met at a press tour was unimpressed or met her I was there you know to take pictures of people sign autographs and say hello to people and she comes up to me with these pictures\nFloored me and everybody around around me wanting to get pictures they they everything's stopped and they were looking at these pictures and I have them also\nIn my article but where we runs can be posting them on Facebook students even to the right to the Facebook page and see the thing [noise]\nBut once again these are things that don't fit the mold these are things in certainly don't belong here\nDon't have an explanation for them\nAnd they're even more terrifying than the Boogie Man\n[noise]\n\nSeven Daniel fall flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals had lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on

S C I go all the PR there's like a full load\nAnd sitting in the parking lot\nIs a big sale on a trailer\nAnd the name of the show which happens\nTo be heat wave wow I thought that was very strange\nThat the that the ... century finger new city and what that is is that where you you feel like the world is revolving around you it's kind of a a play on that say in the world is revolving around you were\nLike for example you're you're humming a song alright the songs on your mind you're ... you're in the car and songs on the radio or you were you're talking about a topic with a friend and the next day you hear somebody like me talking about it on the radio or you're somebody on\nOn a you know they're talking about the very same things are very detail you're saying it's a synchrony city but they called us ... secretive the\nBecause it's only about you with the idea that you are the sun and everything is kind of revolving around you're kinda like orbiting around you topics music ideas\nAnd for some reason it's where all the things clicked together for you and that's what the strange experience it\nWell it produce something what's that than I Am\n... that has to do is opening all let's say a temporary portal or if I use to fit that safe in this city was specifically\nOr merely a check for it and I'll let you know that okay you're on track ... with where you're supposed to be in life at that particular point\nRight they say the same thing about a new job who actually to the desert they grew also means that you're on the right track or something but yeah finger in this city has one of those weird a weird things because\nYou know people are meaningful coincidence certainly is something I've talked about before and it it's something that happens to people and yeah I Would say that it has something to do with the times clicking together are opening together at one point and if you're aware of it it certainly makes for an interesting uh anomaly it really does\nSo I and I don't think it's a coincidence because what would be a ...\nLike I say I never listen to that station really for the most part I don't like the song normally I Would turn the song of like load town and that kind of stuff but not a particular song so I Would not be listening to that song sort of\nJust depends on who's saying that\nWell it's a heat wave\nBy the ... the original one right Mandela's or ... rather than dollars I guess yeah Vandellas\nUm so I left it on and that and\nReally what hit me afterwards was the vote somebody had to planned on parking at white there\nWhile you know another parking lot why not another position why did I tell him I never took I never never usually take that road heal your centric synchronous today it will it\nProduce something yeah it is um let it with it for ... to the left me and this happened you're running out of time the minute it hit me what was going on to the left and maybe there was a black ... black ... something\nOkay hold on we're going to hold you over\nCold on hold on black when something black wing something something something something will be back [noise]\n", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "23"}
