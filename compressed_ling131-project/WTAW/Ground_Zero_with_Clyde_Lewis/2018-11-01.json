don't just you know get to several freaking weaken the DEA so uh this is something that is you know is is timeless the idea that we're peace uh we we should appeal to a\nPower that I'm a doesn't have any parameters and it's willing to do anything to um to continue to exist in and you know it has complete and utter control over the physical world then why wouldn't you naturally just a gravitate

you priesthood\nWhat's the difference well we can separate religion from magical order we can separate uh the the uh the priesthood of a of a um [noise] I'm a a you know it's a spiritual order from the I'm\nA magical definitions of the hierarchy\nOf of of an of an order you wouldn't call the masons religion you know it's an it's an esoteric order the Brotherhood\nAnd the camps and ... is it is

believe in our position\nOr not because you know we're not looking for followers that's religion uh ultimate game is to bring people in so they can feel the coffers\nThat they need to continue the uh the edifice so they're directly tied in with politics and we're any political so I can see why young people would be a turned off to those kinds of ideas because not find their answers\nIn their uh their leaders um [laughter] unfortunately seem to be finding what they think their their answers in their uh their their musical masters and that's a can every music is garbage so\nOr something right there you can never use it as garbage there's so many people that will tell you but some of the pop stars right now have a lot of soul their souls to state and then they use a lot of satanic imagery what do you say that\nWell that's like Christians calling Buddhist Satanist because it's not Christian so we're not really looking\nAt I mean they're going to be the big they're giving the the ... the yeah I mean we're not looking\nAt a definitive definition of satanism or black looming on us you know we're we're we're looking at a a confusion of the symbolism\nThat can find its way into various elements of the cold and may even find themselves itself into certain areas of satanism but they're they're not defining satanism you know in a proper way they're just looking at anything that is anti Christian heart tuned into the cartoonish way way down down to a point in which they can actually understand that\nBut it's enough to scare and Christians enough to get their alerts I mean I don't know if you've been on the Internet but a lot of people out there the learning people to aluminum is the symbolism said sounding symbolism a you know those types of things do you do put any ... is there a lot of power and using ... and things that are said panic in nature well\nSymbols are the combination of various ideas combined into a single Jeff and Jeff is like a piece of information that you can find that in any type of computer come a program you can define an entire program\nOr a meaning or language for a for a set of ah [noise]\nAh [noise] control operative points in you know in

broke up upon was when the ... death or the the paranormal ... there was about to expose what you call they see traffic pedophile rent and that he died in Poland and when he died he threw up all this black\nDo from his body and you would\nHe threw up all this black black blue from his body and you and said that he probably was under attack from a type of phone\nThat's a very good ... a possibility that it happened yes\nSo you think black chaos magicians that were psychotic probably attacked him and killed him\nThe the thing is is that this is such a such\nA magnificently or\nA exotic instrument in the annals of magic that just not a lot of people that have access to it or would know how to even begin to build something like that it really takes an engineer\nI'm there are a rudimentary manifestations of this thing is being a form of um [noise] project or\nThat he's just symbols and then you can you had your will to it and uh you know\nProject editor I met ... ... ... manifestation enemy and\nYou know make something happen or which essentially is not unlike what happens when you are you are in a ritual chamber with that\nAn effigy and you know when you static interviewee or you shoot it or something else\nBut um ... you can take this to a level in which you could um you know do multiple manifestations of people from all over the world and you could digitize the entire thing and you could run run it through a project that had special filters needs filters might represent a forms of a\nDisease or radioactivity or ... or any one of a number of poisons and\nAll they have news program the molecular structures of these things I've done this yes I mean I've done it I've I've not done it I have not uh have you after you do it but I have seen it in action are one thing I have done is I've use what are called causal engines\nAnd you know what a causal engine is I've used causal engines before to get money meaning that I've found ways to program a causal engine\nTo bring a little bit of money into my pocket meaning that ah when I use it it sends out into the universe the idea that I Need money and somehow I find money in a pocket they know existed or I get a check in the mail that I Know I was going to get a check from\nSo what I really need money and I've ever really desperate I'd buy set up my own makeshift causal engine using a computer\nA I'm a PowerPoint presentation slide\nAnd then I take like you were talking about the gifts you were talking about yes I'd take gifts and Jay pigs and I find them that they're animated and they send out beams towards me and money and whatever and that's how I get money sometimes if it's a weird causal engine situation\nI wouldn't I I once used the causal engine to cool my apartment which was weird\nI'm really terrible at money magic only great at lemonade and people like well I'm I'm I'm not ... I I'm not\nAbout using causal engines for money and says I don't get a lot 'cause I I'm a humble person if I Want to use that stuff I don't use a causal engine for anything I'm a pretty humble person money doesn't interest me because I don't want to I don't want to knock the wrong powers you know what I mean I mean\nMoney money doesn't interest me I'm not interested in okay well you can bring other things to using ... yeah or you can go with something like a regular like engineering and a whole other set of all the other I rather and do something and I\nI'm a yeah so the ah but yeah but a technological sorcery\nIs something that has been touched upon um the chaos magicians feel hind and a doctor Hyatt stuff have talked about these things but not to the degree in which they they never really been developed\nUm to the point in which um my order the chaos in the room has it's generated them has developed in because I'm\nA I'm a machine is an engineer and several of the other people that I worked with in this in this group are also engineer so we know how to go about them\nSeeing at a problem all the way through\nTo the end in like solving it and using metaphysics as a way of being able to get there so\nWhat we're doing is as sophisticated as anything you would see in a um [noise] military grade um development of a weapon mhm and uh so uh but we do believe that technology is is that actually has made it so when you hear about people talking about while the devils and it's in cell phones are in computers or whatever it's like most\nThere's certainly a spirited that most ah I'm In arguably alive inside of\nA digital information and it has control of these culture\nBut about algorithms I mean those seem to be the the arms of magic now they tend to push people in directions that would normally go and a lot of people don't realize are under the spell of algorithms what our algorithms I mean are they are they very valuable the magician now\nBut uh there's absolutely nothing within the digital world that I Would like turn away or if it um presented itself is a possibility for being able to be exploited as a magical device\nWhat about robots and among July I Know that a ... bay once said that uh you know we'd have our own personal slaves would be robotic he says is the ultimate blasphemy to God what do you say about androids robots and that sort of thing was the chaos in dream thing about\nWell as anybody taken a good look at a\nReal dull dot com it's it's already here and it's being developed more and more every day so that that you have\nA technologically astute beautifully presented then packaged form of legal slavery because that's what those things are you'd be able to come home and uh take out your frustrations or your lust or um [noise] ... are your innermost desires with a\nYou know a a\nNephew human facsimile in life\nAnd we'd be completely legal at least at this point it is and uh so yeah he believed that I'm ... the first manifestations of that weren't going to look like robots they basically weren't they they look like that computer screen you're actually sitting in front of\nBut eventually they were going to look like people and they do look like people now now they look like porn stars right and uh they fulfill uh you know and give meaningful lines to people who have an ... an inability to be able to deal with with so called organic humans I find the I'm absolutely all for that\nWhile they are now they remind me of corpses and look at me going to have sex with somebody who's dead\nLike a machine I mean\nThings while I think we should have the right to have real sex with real dead people and that's why I'm hockey [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYou're not winking at me [laughter] just kidding\n[laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] my God [laughter] All right [laughter] the all those rags is with\nUs in a ground zero so okay black magic and um [noise] the idea that ah the Internet now is the place where it's going the exploits of the Internet think about um I Want to think about the power structure now on the thing about\nHow we're looking at the power structure and how the power structure seems to be built\nOn black magic it's being built with us in our key there is a center involved here and what I mean by that is the ...\nSeems to be under the control of something that would be you know I wouldn't call it the vine per se I call it some sort of a darker a type of influence and when we talk about the center of the word is that power come from\nBeing generated from within and it's it it's on his way to ... so we're creating this well where are you crazy it through technology but he'd say growing form of of mind that\nCrazy it through technology but he'd say growing form of of mind that are going to a uh eventually become completely conscious\nThere is no doubt about that whatsoever that the next day tomorrow evolution so the singularity literally I mean they're saying that it's when a robot or get ... but is it really going to be a real coming from are going to be a program it's going to be it's going to be universal and it's gonna come from us
