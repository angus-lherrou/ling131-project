same day or days afterwards\nWere protests will be having there will be some fighting going on I'm sure\nAll the time you're at and I do I mean yeah I'm well\nI mean you've probably out Clyde you're overreacting no I mean when you get on a train you know with a bunch of women wearing being kept one morning and wondering what the hell's going on or when you have to plan your day around riots or when Ron and I have to get hotel rooms in the middle of the night because the whole city smells of tear gas\nUh yeah you get pretty used to it and the and the bombs bursting in air I mean we're like
