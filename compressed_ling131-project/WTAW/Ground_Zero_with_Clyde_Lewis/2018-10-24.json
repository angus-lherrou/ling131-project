zero such a fascinating fascinating poverty talking about someone who can talk about the practical\nNature of good and evil what can be aliens demon fallen angels all of the things\nThat we talked about before but with a different viewpoint in a different idea different view that I'm really excited to be presenting to you tonight with him\nUh you know Paul it's I'm One of the things that I was reading about with the ancient cultures\nYou were talking about parasitic evil or parasitic or entities moving in taking over the host or you know either possessing them or killing them or destroying them decimate ing them have you heard about the ancient cultures other used to say you have the worms or it was the idea that uh worms\nOr where the demons in mythology and actually that people are if they had parasites or worms the the the the age of ... it was the ... the angel game of the races of worms there were competing for the bodies the blood and mine's a one another gone all over the world you get ... a blood drinking vampires or\nA cannibals all these things in history and even in the Bible talks about this and you're looking at your saying wow\nAre we really being tormented by and I've heard this term before the conquering worm what do you think\nYeah term for my girl and poll a ... you have to be very careful I think here collide I'm\nThere may be a certain factor that is true in in what you just said but I think we have to be really careful of of a first of all it's maintaining our personal responsibility\nAnd maintaining the integrity of science is one of the ... science is not a ... is is very rarely valuable actually by all accounts\nHowever that being said are there have been cases I'm thinking one particular in Rhode Island or whether it was a man who was just being pummeled by\nA Paris typical ... in in a multi family housing a dwelling and a shame share way and I were working on this was Twenty years ago but as the man had all kinds of he was home bound because of illness you had a pancreatic cancer which is really nasty\nBut as soon as the parasite left he actually went into remission I'm going there may have been no relationship\nBut did there was an ancient belief that the demonic or or whatever with they wouldn't say parasitic all but demonic\nA factor in in physical illness was a real one um I've seen ... I was able to have special courses up at the seminary this one is all seminary near the state hospital in August ... New York a set up a for me uh by the academic game\nBecause they want to be be able to tell the difference between whose crazy and who was you know like protests that kind of thing but it wasn't that simple because the ... the psychiatric illnesses at times to me seemed to be intertwined with\nThe um paranormal phenomena and and and and with the the parasitic ... at least as I was beginning to think that they were\nAnd so uh it's a very complex and dangerous past I think to start 'em that just start down and as far as he blaming parasites or physical wounds illnesses and I should point out that in the gospels\nThere was a clear distinction made from time to time between people who are crazy and people who are possessed\nShore and and ... and the divisions there in the idea that there were things yeah how ... how can we get it out of him and ... you know just goes back to things like what electroshock therapy dj drives all the memory out or whatever else a shock to the system trauma to the system either brings in the demon or whatever it is or takes it out and uh you\nKnow what's that I once I got I got rid of the worst pollster guys I ever dealt with a New Haven Connecticut Nineteen Seventy nine by using a joke book okay now I wouldn't recommend that was just at that particular circumstance no I think that's brilliant\nYou know I mean it's just the humor I always I always tell my two sons that you know always last but not at each other keep a positive right a bit and I call it the Peter Pan theory think happy thoughts\nWhat are these things feeding on they seem to to get stronger when there's negativity as I mentioned bridge for you know the the feeding your anger 'em and they seem to get weaker ... or even repelled when positive energy use their hands humor\nA face no and that's good that uh dispel the negative energy will cut off the food supply and they'll go somewhere else\nWho's bringing up that is why again this\nBrings up something I'd have to bring up after the break something that uh I also want to ask you about because I've asked you know people like Rosemary guy all you know there's been a ... they agree with you all get pissed off about his two I'll ask you the the the do the one hundred thousand one point six billion dollar question coming up on the ground zero so\nBe waiting for it [noise] follow you know was it on grounds are they read your phone call to Tripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six Seventy three thirty seven hundred I'm Lewis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\n\nWell time [noise] [noise] mine\nMine [noise]\nAnd I and I said if it goes centers I say you know what that's like telling someone you're going to the bathroom go to the bathroom I don't want to go back home I don't want him is the same thing you don't tell it goes to go to like you don't tell the spirit to go to like the stupidest thing I've ever heard don't do that okay I always laugh and say well the the lives of trap don't go there\nThe second thing is that so many people and I always get into arguments because I've had experiences investigating ghosts and investigating demons too and they always say all you gotta say quite as I reviewed given the name of Jesus Christ and it goes away no it doesn't and I've always had the argument no it doesn't\nBecause you cannot and I and I tell you that sometimes we have entities that are in places that seem\nTo be older or even pre atomic demons dinner there that it's somehow don't even know what we're talking about they just look at it didn't laugh\nI'm just curious is that I mean I always say well that's the that's the first antibiotic to use if that doesn't work then what and and the ones that always works well no it doesn't always work\nOut can you tell me because I've been noticing to that in horror films lately they don't use Satan anymore they're using ... or vowing or as Modi is rather demons or ... of course was in The Exorcist\nThey're using all these other demons and people like going well they're all Satan anyway no they're not there are there there's a hierarchy of demons even Solomon said so so what's your take on the idea that the the the whole I review and Jesus Christ or antibiotic redeeming\nWell if you believe it yeah yeah ... you don't just sit there like a lump climate stuff happens to you you bring something to it or whether it be a big for the spirits UFO of ... whatever or possession or as as we call it now which is actually a voluntary bonding\nAnd I I I agree with everything he said\nWell I mean I I just don't see a point in bringing a priest into a Muslim household and and have a June ... commanded by a a Christian priest to get out of a home with a gym doesn't answer to Jesus\nAbsolutely I don't think they're the ... the same as ours at all yeah there are about nine different species of these things at least that we've dealt with and I think you know in the cases of eggs are systems that I assisted appraised with\nThey were using them against us you know the whole ... you know the position of authority you know the the three different existence impressed within the ritual itself the command to give its name a\nI think the most horrifying thing that ever happened to me was that at the time they don't like to talk about this but we're in the St Lawrence the hospital when the priest demanded that the thing that we thought was possessing Barbara\nSeventeen year old girl a demand that or give it its name and and I told a priest outside so how do you always telling the truth\nYou know like well because the U.S and it's it's a it's bound by the authority of Christ to tell us a trip and uh they they send the ritual because she has said it twice and the gossip is a bit but this thing\nUh I didn't believe it it said his name was shall see ha well I assume mhm and it had told the girl that was a guiding spirit to her and all his business\nAnd in my mind I didn't see it it just in my mind I said yeah right and the thing immediately addressed me in a language that turned out to be mainly\nOf all things and the doctor had to look it up and he was recording all this I don't know where these tapes I remember the Vatican by now but he um\nThey wouldn't tell me what he said at the ... until the end of the school year and a father a Lawrence the priests just said he didn't feel right not telling me what that was addressed to me he said yes\nAnd the thing I I when I was seven years old I witnessed my father's suicide and and that was something that that got me into it would be interested in what happened to my father right and this thing and perfect male I said that it had been there when my father had committed suicide and it had told him to do it\nAnd had he had this thing spoken to me in English I Would have lost it obviously right there and and that's why they didn't want to tell me right\nSo I've had to live with that the words of this thing and I just don't [noise] excuse me\nI just don't think these things have the same theology so they're using it against us and it got stronger as a matter of fact within three years a barber was dead\nA drug overdose and of of the six or seven people we ah had to deal with at that point a father Lawrence after I graduated the left I had to ... ... exercise them again and the ... systems at times will take months involve several praise\nIt takes it takes a while and uh you know the reason why I I I used to be of the you know Jesus Christ works all things a mindset\nUntil one time I was at a a place or they were ... they called me in to do an investigation and it was a former theater former a mortuary that turned into a bar they turned into a bar in the bar was on his had all kinds of problems that cream of tore him in the basement of all places it was hard it was crazy\nAnd uh we decided that we were going to go in and we had this room and we wanted to find out what was going on you know what was haunting the place and one of the things that happened and this is the scary thing that's ever happened you know when you when you do say ounces or when you do things like this you always tell people one\nIf you're going to be part of the aunts you can't have any alcohol at least after you're done you're going to go have whatever beer you want but don't have any alcohol don't come into the sounds drunk don't come into the say on a you know either way\nAll don't come into the sounds drunk don't come into the say on a you know the way you know that is under the medications because it's a definitely create a problem\nAnd we had a woman that demanded that she'd come into the stance that we were doing to try and contact whatever he was going on there come to find out what happened is we had corners in this ... we had women that were standing at the corners of the same lines to make sure\nWatching everything to make sure everything was going okay no demons or anything or getting into the room where we're using a several ways several or goals to look into\nWhat was going on and all of a sudden I'm I realized something was wrong in the circle and I noticed the women in the room were buckling over you know there were doubling over in pain every woman who's doubling over and paying except for this one young girl who was at the table and his older woman and I was seeing what the hell's going on here\nAll of a sudden and this is not no joke and I have a a a guy named Aaron who I worked with who was doing this and he was there with me and there was another girl and said you worked at me as well she was kind of describe what we're getting from ... from other things and\nAnd uh all of a sudden these are the demon we've done it was a demon called it ... the average suit and I realized what was it was the demon that hunts down children in the womb and kills them\nAnd I was noticing all the way we're doubling over down I realize that something was wrong and I and I told everybody to get away get out of a get out of the bar they all had to evacuate we evacuated the bar come to find a there was a woman the woman demanded to be in the same I've actually had been drinking that night and we found out she was pregnant\nAnd we were furious because this was something that attracted a demon\nAnd the demon was actually a Mesopotamia demon that basically hunted down women\nTo go into their wounds and kill their children and the reason why these women were doubling over is because of the fact that whatever was going on in that room that demon was going from woman to woman to try and find that baby and the only reason why the older woman\nDidn't double over she had a hysterectomy and the other girl was not of age to be in a bar and we found that out too\nAnd so this was one of the scariest moments I ever had and it wasn't the power of Jesus that had to take it out we had the command it calling upon angel after angel and even some of the names of other demons and and and just calling out we had a\nA medium there we had a priest there we had a number of people there and we were doing every everything we can't my poor friend Aaron who was working with the he\nWas actually shoved indoor wall and he was stuck on the wall is if he was Velcro to the wall\nAnd he had asthma and he could not breathe\nSo we had to get 'em an inhaler and once he took the breath and Hillary fell off the wall it was the scariest experience I ever heard of that because one person violated the rule you know that's the thing is when you're doing things like this people don't realize how powerful it is\nAnd they will challenge it will challenge it by either being drunk or drug or they'll do something that they're not supposed to do and that's why we hear horror stories about ... board\nThat's where your horror stories about turtle cards is because people don't realize how powerful they are and they play with them as if their toys and they're not toys it's like playing with a plastic bag you put over your head you'll suffocate\nAnd that's that's how I feel about that what do you say about that\nA ... percent meaning should have done the stance on the first place well you know\nWe knew we had to do it though because we we were the ghost investigators were there that we had and they were good investigators they're competent ones\nWe had a priest that they demand that because the problem was that the the building was having all kinds of problems I mean bad Seward of backing up they had this black Terry dues back you up in the in the ... in the basement\nAnd they said it was this this has happened to go horror stuff quiet what are you going to do so I organized a group of people to go in and and take care of it but uh you know one of the things they did was they wanted to hold assailants and and it was very well done\nUh but we made sure we had to make sure that people that came in were responsible and apparently they weren't\nResponsible we didn't take it seriously and that's why we have the problem [noise] so they they well they condemn the building now it's still hot today at a bank and they went out of business because they couldn't keep up the place was so hunted after we left [noise] well I think you might find that it went back a lot farther than the funeral home there are certain places just shouldn't build buildings now where they are ... what they call it what they\nCall it the butcher block as what they call it that that area it's called the butcher block area and it's because they had butchers and they had [noise]\nFuneral homes and everything that air yeah going backwards recalls Paul you know was ground zero Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred
