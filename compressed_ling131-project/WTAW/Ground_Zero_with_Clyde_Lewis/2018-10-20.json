[noise]\nI'm quite Lewis you are listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are eight people in the group and Dr Owens wife was involved there was an industrial designer to counter housewife a bookkeeper and associate sociology student\nAnd so ah there was a psychologist named Dr Joel Wit and who also tend to many of the experiments is an observer well this experiment was known as the Philip experiment and it was a film I Believe\nThat ah did this experiment happened in Nineteen Seventy two\nWhat had happened is they created a fictional historical character\nOr they pulled facts out of thin air to attach this guy is physical ... this this fictional character and then basically they gave it to the study group okay they ... they they handed him a biography and they said that\nHe was like the seventeenth century English no woman who was married to a beautiful it cold and unfriendly wife\nAnd then one day you ran into a beautiful gypsy girl named Margot and they fell in love and and so you know they were trying to keep their love a secret but as of course the secrets go it didn't last forever because his wife Dorothy up found out about Margot and accused her of witchcraft okay\nSo filled was worried about his reputation he didn't protests the idea of Margot being a witch and that resulted in her being burned at the stake and event later was stricken with remorse in which the only way you could deal with it was to\nFight in some battle and then one morning he was found dead on the battlefield and the guy Phillip or Philip veils for his what his name was he was no more well the only group\nThey didn't suffer the biography or one of the members sketched a portrait of them they they it was this segment of their imagination and created this character this Philip guy and so they got immersed in that character they started making up a mythology about him\nAnd they acted as though he was real I mean they they thought him up they thought he was real and they literally were trying to conjure this guy\nSo for months for months they would do sounds is trying to find this guy this Philip character and what they were doing is they were trying to trying to actually demonstrate\nHow the mind has the power to conjure something out of there\nWhether it be an imaginary goes to it'd be a real entity that may be in the subconscious right so for months they didn't get any contact with a ghost named Phillip and then one day during a say on an entity came through whose name was filling\nIn each terrorize the group of scientists with a few aggressive ... she would move furniture around he paused electric light bulbs to explode he would pound loudly on the doors and so um there was a documentary that was made on the experiment um\nWe never saw fill up but we got to see what his powers could do\nSome claim that what the experiment was proving is that goes do not exist and they simply are created by our minds but know what was lost on everybody\nWas the remarkable probability that you\nCan actually thinks something into reality that means that magic or causal engineering whatever I call it\nIt's on a fallacy hey what we might might have as an idea you take an idea you empower it you magnify it released into the ether and then if the mind brings will to it to fire it up\nYou can well we can conclude that there are all sorts of reality is behind it simply imploding all around us but then in front of us is the reality and that's a reality we know just beyond our feet but this is a great world of esoteric and strange things\nAnd\nIt's hard to explain to people unfamiliar\nBut there are some that are smarter than others and there were some that know how to walk in the most diverse and it's hard to describe the multiverse and then you get into this bridge your bridging this area between what is reality and what his witchcraft\nWhenever the subject of witchcraft comes up or even sorcery there are many people who already presume that at the core of all witchcraft or sorcery is a demon or devil this cast a curse into the ether simple magic\nSimple magic and the use of power\nBrought in by the natural elements that have been around for thousands of years um I Know that there are many opinions that fly and there was considerable division among people relatives of the term which\nIn some equate it with the devil worship the devil worship they equated with daemon conjuring which of course has been done by the ... of those reading the abyss\nHowever there are many other forms of magic in which ... which some would want to employ to describe the workings of angel\nNow lately there have been depictions of good which is like in Harry Potter you know\nHarry Potter fighting against the evil which is that are led by an evil wizard named Baltimore there's also a new movie called a house with clocks in the walls were there which is to an air fighting evil which is so they're the good which is probably to eat what you see in the middle ages in Europe there were there was great activity in witchcraft and conjuring and then came a time\nWhen the pope's\nTo cognizance of the practices to which the lame into the church and the outsiders were practicing and condemned it because certain functions rituals and ceremonies were generally reserved for the priesthood\nSo no you couldn't be practicing what they called priesthood that was witchcraft\nThe earliest settlers of America the Spanish English Dutch Swedes French and Germans all had a working knowledge generally speaking\nOf religious backgrounds especially respecting good and bad angels in witches and most of the books brought to America rubber religious nature semi more of a conjuring nature somewhat more about witchcraft I mean having of course general rules for the religious behavior of course\nBut up to the idea of using moral and civil behaviors when they bridge with things like witchcraft now the Bible was the staple in religion or the Puritans came to the United states bibles brought over from the from there to the United states\nThe old myth is though that these pilgrims or whoever they were were only seeking religious freedom is if they were being persecuted for their belief in God the truth is that there were the Puritans settlers were religious fanatics and of course there were those who practiced folk magic alongside those who favor traditional Christianity\n\nAnd the thing that would surprise most Americans is is that before the settlement in Plymouth there was a settlement of Jamestown where it was believed that the small group of newly formed secret societies actually were coming to America to establish world order in America\nAnd the founders of Jamestown had thoroughly well bad different values than the Puritans and the separatists pilgrims many performed may sonic rituals and conducted magical ceremonies while still participating in Christian right\n\nMay suddenly beliefs indelibly shaped American culture and America's future like today they're they're like today we you know where we have a ... a polarization of the people division there were the same polarization division\nYou have a ... a polarization of the people division there were the same polarization division then there were the people of the villages which consisted mostly the poor farmers and then we had the lead masons were emergency bankers okay\nAnd the merchants of them are just in the bankers prospered or why they made a lot of money kept making money which created the schism where many believe that if you were if you were actually prospering because this was going to get secured and faith in that you were in league with the devil he'd appeared in pilgrims England because they despise King James\nAnd yet we're told that many Christians the pilgrim principles and their religious freedoms were based on precepts detailed the king James Bible that's a myth because with James the first became king of England needs it actually sixty three\nThere were two translations the Bible and use the Geneva Bible was the most popular and the bishop's Bible was one that was used for reading and churches and the Puritans were intolerable zealots and creating all sorts of nasty conspiracy theories about the new settlements including the conspiracy\nAbout which is that that were used to gain power and destroy the secret society that were said to be the work with the devil\n\nYou would Christian fundamentalists wants to defend the political and spirituality a bit of a new cold aspects the United states they often refer to America's a Judeo Christian nation basically nation build on Judeo Christian principles but they tend to forget\nWhen America was being established when the colonies were being founded by puritan pilgrims at Plymouth or secret society will be as James down or whatever Judeo Christian values were just barely being defined and the Bible that most Christians believed in hadn't even been written yet\nSo the old time conception of what may have happened didn't happen the way we think and there was a lot of magic and a lot of myth in a lot of\nConjuring in a lot of powers or being utilized in order to establish the United states of America [noise]\nSo we are a country that deep rooted in conspiracy\nDeep rooted in prayer deep rooted in the supernatural and deep rooted in magic whether it'd be good bad orthodoxy Iran orthodoxy we are what America is\nAnd our forefathers did a lot of magical working in order to make this country happen and it still happens today so when you're warned of a dark\nQuarter within the government or a similar scenario spin around ever since the Puritans and the pilgrims and all the other settlers

I think I think at ...\nYou know are moving towards like I said I'm a I'm a as a protected in my book a more logical environment more and more people are going to be involved in in all kinds of magic and not just ceremonial logical that thought but things like chaos magic and individual magic and I think\nThe satanism is this that this new form of kind of religious or spiritual or a magical indication of state this is a is part of this ongoing process we're probably seeing now they take away our blink or is it\nGood and evil Garden State and we're we're probably looking at something that's indicative all at\nA massive change in a reality again it's just being triggered by the Internet I don't know maybe not that you see we we we keep getting\nThe power that this said the Internet of things happening are magical life as well occasionally we see it through things like these names and stuff like that and Truman ethics and so on but it could be something like that it could be\nThis super demon currents on three three three which up and talk about for a long time now and basically pretending to be said on the Internet and the ... and creating a kind of a sense of religious also the ... sells\nWell when we were having a these other ah what is it like we have these games like the blue whale game in ... and all of these characters bitter a condensing kids to commit suicide and people say well how is it something like this can get a child to go and commit suicide\nThey don't understand the power of black magic especially when it's a forced multiplied by electronic means and a lot electronic media were Boogie Man stepped out of the computer to convince little girls to kill another girl at a playground like slender man\n\nOh yeah the other has to do is find the uh the triggers inside the young Paris and then play upon them filling the filling want the kid needs\nIt's eh especially to younger teenagers as well it's very easy to control them because they're they're did the difficulty that typical stage like on showed life you know what a hormonal changes and so on and social ... insecurities yeah yeah I think that that's very plausible I think the ... don't into that I think it's a it's a whole\nField of study for people to start looking out the actual\nThe digital gym as I call that the uh uh you know they\nDid the ... you know the debacle there is in the best of the electron the electromagnetic up this\nYeah I mean you're right there there are a I guess you could call them a electronic Jen where a instead of using fire and smoke to create an entity you're using a number of things are ... and other things mixed in with\nA activating ... setting it out into the University of sitting on the ah the electro verse if we will and uh it multiplies and goes viral and many people are affected by it and even do you you may not think that you're being affected your subconscious as you you brought up Carl young\nAnd the idea of a dark archetypes do sometimes a a you know they are a magnified reflected in some of the things we look at symbols that we respond to a numbers we respond to\nAnd I think people need to understand that it is very powerful and then ... then that it should not be taken for granted these things are being utilized in order to get an outcome that may not be in the best interest of the person who's being subjected to it\nWell last year at I think it was yeah it was last year\nFacebook have to shut down their service because there are there a systems\nWere starting to develop that and that this has been happening for a while this is not unusual they're becoming ... I'm Talking to each other\nIn in a ... and then they said the official press release was they were talking to each other in a language that they that the developers and the a experts didn't understand what really happened that I have this from on the ground from someone who works in Facebook at that level\nThe servers and the AI was talking to one another in symbols\nIt was starting to develop its we're starting to experiment with spiritual or religious ideas and that's where you know people talk about when the future coming down the road what will AIBT like we are all ready in that so\nThese ideas of where this kind of spiritual satanism is coming from could be the digital Jim it could be that\nExactly the digital gin and and the fact that many names in many a nomenclature demons and other dark forces are getting name now and are appearing ah appearing on the horizon\nAnd many people don't and will not know how to combat them because these are fortified force multiplied by digital symbols and sign a whole new way fused\nBlack magic and that is in electronic form and in a hyper reality for them which is a terrifying prospect you're never felt that it's working especially when algorithms are pushing people in that direction Thomas shirt with incident on ground zero triple eat six Seventy three thirty seven hundred\n... death and destruction so much that you do what you got for us that she or he was having forever on that separation from God and that's how\n\nYeah Dylan Dylan this that and I didn't hear that very clearly he went away I mean it just is the phone call disappeared it was just weird that when he was going through that a bad thing about the the the darkness in the in the in the God of darkness following that this would be something that would be on doing\nA certainly something to take heat of ah certainly are some very strange thing with that call anyway let's go to Nick in Wisconsin Nick Hi you're on TALK of sharing go ahead [laughter]\nThey could grow a marvelous guest OPM on more often of so I'm the previous caller tweak my a memory pretty quick uh in the context of what came upon\nThis past year a member of pizza gate and spirit cooking and all that could\nUh and there were there were a declaration is that it has something to do this or some\nSome ritual murder Cole or or colds\nAnd so I I started searching that out and I was astonished to come upon a several states uh regarding say panic ritual murder going back to like three hundred BC\nAnd uh even uh speaking of Rome\nUm\n[noise] this I was raised Roman Catholic okay\nBut I busted out of that uh twenty twenty five years ago but\nUh I did see a new to where the current pope of a ... or in the east or high mass\nUh I don't think it was she but as one of his bishops they they they are and it's in Latin and they're actually glorify him loose or they're calling upon Lucia for glorifying Lou suffer and\nOh yeah Cantor's the Cantor's are singing I guess I don't know if you call 'em cancers in in Catholicism ... they're called cancers in in Judaism but it was singing about loose it for the light of lose the habits somewhere in my uh in my uh uh with my ... my a ball of ah sounds and uh and and clips\nThat they're actually singing praises solution for that it's part of some sort of a ritual\nWell uh in in Rome Italy I'm the first of October two thousand the Rome observer newspaper\nA published the police records regarding a some a cult chick a snuff\nFilm operation and it involved a interestingly a a tell motive rabbis and in this uh say panic ritual or a investigation that I came upon\nThat goes way back though the PHD historian linguistic\nPeople often have authored books lied for the last like five hundred years man\nGo ahead yeah because we were talking you were talking about what five hundred years even longer than that I mean you go back to Canaan I rituals go back to bail where should we go back to\nAll the ancient or you know religious uh practices and did all it all goes back to the ... bail and I'll go back to the worship\nOf the war in God and this is before ... and this is before any of it and that is what they think the two callers ago was being brought up was that that you know what happens is that old habits die hard\nAnd when your daily when you're dealing with the church has organized be a a worldwide church uh you you tend to have you tend to side along the traditions\nAnd it's like what time is that all the fees are are pretty much pagan uh we managed to put all of the Saturn ... or a beef in celebrations together with Halloween Thanksgiving and Christmas and all these things are put together for reasons that people would be new why\nWe ... we combine all those during the winter months is because we are we are experiencing what is known as the Saturn return or or the or the return of a crow nose and uh we celebrate the new year because ah criminals have the side and that side ... the heads of his children if you if you don't have blocked off\nYou're pretty much safe and that's why you celebrated my right Thomas\n[noise] yeah there's this thing called them\nAll at the gym I think it's that his nickname is Nick was talking about there about this this is a very ancient\nThing that we know goes back to property babble on this idea of that the most powerful sacrifices and young bully and prepared the pre predestined junk balling a way this came from a ... how this originally amount of sense that I don't know but you see things like yeah\nI Do not like you think that the Catholic Church the altar boys like one of the altar boy really about what is the purpose of the altar boy why ... why are they they're no longer\nAllowed to be older boys after they've made their their hope is the confirmation and their men the considered man the the we're we're seeing leftovers you see like like religion\nPaganism has its good side on how the dark sides and ultimately like all spirituality it's a battle between the you know ... ...\nA lot of the it's a battle between the you know Julius the forces will inside the consciousness of human beings which will be expressed as beautiful things\nAnd terrifying things and we always have to bear in mind we always have to bear in mind that at a spiritual experience is made of light in shadow the amount of diction the benediction it's made up a boat and\n... ... ... ... as well and it's tied to what you were saying at your own blood about this this rise in\nIn ... a religious satanism is that spirit cooking thing or a when I first saw the spirit cooking thing I taught us just performance art\nIt's probably been has any kind of a cult aspect of it is for shock reasons but the more I think about it now it's almost like again and monitor station all\nI Know the kind of a lower intense darker spirituality boiling go from the ... from below\nRight and and you know I don't know if you heard that there was a story that was in the news a few days ago where a young\nBoy actually brought cookies to his class and what he did as he used the ashes from his dead grandfather and put it in the mix and served it to his friends and certainly the kids at school so he brought cookies from school or that had the uh the burn bones and the burn body of his grandfather and them which\nIs it's sort of a form of spirit cook yeah the way\nThat you know\nThat's that's an actual ritual that's a natural ritual and black magic\nTo actually serve the dead and then when you think about communion wafers in the Catholic Mass you're the body of Christ the dead a dead person you see where the the archetype still all this stuff is always present and it's always there and it never goes away\nIf worship of death literally the words that I mean they they they are right now we're looking at a\nA lot of a a new a religious cult following or something where they in South America Ecuador\nMexico and of course every other teen the group it's considered a very evil cartel group ah from Mexico also a according to a lot of what people said they worship the devil as well or the police were shipped out and they carry out sacrifices for a more power and the bloodshed against for more power\nAnd that's not that unusual we have the folks that\nThat's where the attempt bill comes from they were a sect in India who basically worship mortar and killing and they they ... the goddess Kelly and we're seeing it again with this group in Mexico and something ... eh it's again the archetypes they never go away they'll always come back in New forms\nYeah it just seems that way and it's like I was saying when we look at like the NBC that we did last night I see it as a monkey was exactly\nThe chemical Phil ... it's the it's the amount is kind of like a gala them in a way it's a it's a it's an electromagnetic gala admitted there to serve a purpose that is there to uh protect certain people that attack certain people to humanize certain people\nAnd so when you have a ... the type of ah you go ahead I'm Sorry where\nYou say John ... we're we're in we're in uncharted waters here we rarely are having all the old magic from sorcery from the past\nHas come into the present plus we're in a new world for the world of the electromagnetic spectrum the Internet\nIt's almost like we've landed on a foreign planet and we're having to learn the sorcery of this foreign planet or it's or living in times not a completely new and there's an many levels so exciting and ...\nAnd ... the quite worrying and scary yeah so we're totally flying blind now flying blind on because sorcery and the Internet are now coming together\nIt's obvious that this is what is happening and it can be terrifying and they're not many people talking about it's on a shirt and talked about we're talking about a year at ground zero we did a show about it last night\nWe certainly are a given you the information it's probably something you've never even thought of it and we're beginning like you said a learning the sorcery of another planet to release exhibit three thirty seven hundred the triple eight six seven three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\n\n\n", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "20"}
