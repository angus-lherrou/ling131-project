else who talked about was his last broadcast he ever made from Ecuador\nThe wiring we have now\nThe dialogue gets even more complex\nMass data aggregation will establish some troops about how our cities run it will lead us just or actually score cities on different quality of life metrics you imagine that\nYou you teach you would think whoever talking about the credit social credit okay well social credit will be we count on everybody else\nSocial credit will be hey you do me wrong I'll put stars down\nI'll bring your stars that I bring bring your your numbers down right you screwing the

system\nDrag and fly we talked about the other night right dragging fly\nAnd I and I had a discussion on the ground zero lines and bringing in some political to tell Google just shove it and say hey we don't want you sit there and\n... and pretend like you're you're you're you know you're not playing with a big player in the Internet of things\nThat have money there is that you you get assigned your life away to the devil their alphabet soup you know you do that Google\nIs there and wonder why fourteen hundred people to sign a petition to get you to stop at your own company five of quit\nDealing with a country that has a\nBad I mean that is that's even understood rotten rotten human rights\nThen of course when we designed a smart city ... either guess who's going to be there taking tally China China China China yeah that works\nBut we'll find out how our city's truly run and they will give a rating\nWe will score cities that are based on different quality life matrix\nSevere sitting there just decides what the hell no one's going to want to come to your stupid city\nAgain because of crime because of the way you keep up the city that the way you keep the homeless cleaned up I mean all these things will mount to your social credit score city how you feel about that you you think that just the people are going to be scored you're going to be on score to\nPeople's eyes great well keep na [laughter] you you think you think everybody will\nCare although care about us well this is going to cost you more money\nYou want to bring up the score pay more money\nThat's how the design\nData aggregation so that we know\nHow cities score and the quality of life department\nAll that brings us to the toughest question of all what do we value\nIn human habitat what I mean\nThat that raises another problem we can create a dystopia just as easily as we could create a utopia the dividing line is the seemingly thin\nIt's kind of gray right it's a little you know a delivery I guess\nSay we assume that by tapping into the collective intelligence of both the devices in people we can create a better living environment\nBecause they said over the weekend\nAt the ground zero lounge\nAnd much of what I was discussing the previous week where they examined in great detail and the concerns about our humanity\nOr expressed by everybody I knew I was the most exciting about the meeting was that while many people on my social media have been very critical\nWhat I've been warning people about\nThere was this overall intellectual and critical concern about our future\nIn the future of our children\nAnd our grandchildren\nIt was great to be able to talk\nAbout this in the end they kind of you know get the feel of what people are feeling\nAnd anymore I'm beginning to realize and this is the honest truth I'm beginning to realize something\nAbout social media\nAnd Twitter and all that you don't have the people that say bad things on Twitter say bad things on Facebook they're not my listeners they're not my supporters\nSupport means just that he means support\nOkay so I mean you're going to be critical of something and I say you can disagree with something I say\nYou'll still listen you'll still support the show\nYou understand that you know sometimes the topics are very difficult to try and swallow it very difficult to understand at first because they're new and and and the most certainly or something that the challenges of thinking of most people\nBut to basically look at my my my social media and see people just attack attack attack attack Twitter attack attack a Jack and Jack\nAnd they say I've been listening to you for years no you haven't been listening to me for years\nOr I'm a list there but no you're not a list or or supporter okay if you're a listener\nYou know how things go you follow the show and you know all of the patterns you know what to\nDo and many of you\nMany of you who go back and research some of the old shows understand what's going on here he is not a game\nSure I tried to making as entertaining as possible I Want to make it as entertaining as possible\nBut this is not your little political party the outcry in wind over somebody on your side get screwed over or somebody on the other side get screwed over this is not CNN this is Don MSNBC this is not socks\nThis is ground zero this is one of the big boys play\nRight this is where the grownups play\nAnd it really really makes it just brings my hair straight up\nWhen I meet people\nAnd it was January and then it was genuine wonderful people ever that I ever had a chance to meet\nFriendly interesting kind loving\nTremendous supporters of my program\nAnd then you have the guys out there that are just patrols and you know that's exactly what they are\nBoth Ron and I have decided that with all the wonderful people we've met all over the country\nFrom Virginia to California\nSpeaking engagements\nIdaho Nevada\nOf all these people we we'd been into their cities and towns we do not see anybody\nWho doesn't want to openly talk about things and talk about in the civil way\nFor social media is a big lie\nAnd I'll bet some of the people that are having these conversations are negativity that are putting out this racist content that's hateful content they're all bots\nThere are parts of their sent out there they're basically hijack people's sites that have been oh I don't know ... ...\nThey're all bought for their sent out there they basically hijack people's sites that have been oh I don't

out of the woodwork just to say one bad thing on his website\nThat works this whole idea\nOf the Internet of things this whole idea of robots and and ... and computers and algorithms they're here to screw with your head\nAnd so yes there is intellectual and critical concern\nAbout our future more so than she on Facebook and more so that I see\nThe ... on on the mainstream and what they talk about every night\nWas beyond Kanye getting boots on Saturday Night live I mean come on I mean I knew about this too but you know you can learn this on your own you don't need to always make you do need to

the sawed you're walking on just so the ... can tell a computer\nWhen it's time to watch her yet\nI said no no no\nCan you imagine a time\nWhere your car\nWould send a message limit your car would send you an email\nTelling you that it needs\nA filter changed or spark plugs change or something would you know that would you understand that I just can't fathom it\nWell that's what it is of course but it's because of these micro machines\nAnd of course is going to help with doctors I mean they even have micro mode and you and they'll be able to run tests and the and the most would be able to say you know this is what you do is wrong with you or this is what's going on with you\nWhen the technology exists to actually\nYou know like you ever wonder why with on Star Trek they could just take the tri quarter and go and they all we can fix him doc\nBecause they already have nano technology when Mr Ilan must took a hit a blunt [laughter]\n[laughter]\nEverybody talked about the fact that he was smoking dope they didn't care about what he had to say he was talking about NRA lays\nNano technology that the brain interface with the computer\nIs not for you or me for Generation Z it's for your kids your grandkids\nMy step son Liam that's who it's for\nFor the fourth night crowds for all those guys that that it would gather around their TVs the play Fortnite which by the way I'm very interested in how Liam doesn't Fortnite everyday when he's playing I say how's it going\nYou know what's with the cube did acute explode yes it did that was a long time ago dad okay so what about what is it doing now well there's this huge island and this guy now\nAnd we're trying to figure out why it's there\nI mean think about it you know you're parachuting through this guy in a school bus\nAnd you have special things special gliders they have you come down and then you're you're you're on you know all these crazy character out but you can dance you can send you can shoot\nIt's an interactive t._v. series\nWho would have some good man and interactive ... that that is cool\nAt a TV series at one twenty four hours a day seven days a week that anybody can be a part of India rented playing every night\nDid you know what's going on if you know there's a TV series interactive the kids are playing right now it's called Fortnite\nEverybody wants to play it because that's what it is it's an interactive t._v. show\nThere's no director there is no writer the only person in direct you ride of the people that are described that are going in and breaking stuff up and shooting stuff that's exactly what it is\nNext step smart city next step interactive going into a room I mean what Bradbury talked about the time the kids came home from school and they would hunt real animals in their bedrooms there are holograms reports they felt like they were real animals but it was all because of nanotech\nSo there's good and bad but the bad stuff\nThe bad stuff is where they can monitor everything you do\nAnd that's the city of tomorrow and that's the technological utopia but the smart cities have been pushed you all along with the United nations\nIs all part of the agenda it's all part of agenda Twenty one it's all part of a smart cities in\nTwenty thirty and green economy and you know and and you know\nI've been talking about this for years and we're all going on climate will never come to that it is that it's happening now they're pushing the issue of the FCC wants people to start putting together and their budgets and saying hey we need this\n[noise] this is like the conversion over from the\nHorse drawn carriage to the car so this is from the\nCar to the driverless car that brings your pizza every night when you want pizza\nOr the Chinese food ... or whatever you use [noise]\nIt's amazing it's also scary but my God [noise]\n[laughter] it's there and it's happening and uh\nI Hope it shrinks you into reality dribble aids except for three thirty seven hundred extra believes except for three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis show some ground zero for me right back don't go away\nLast time [noise] when mine\nThe mind [noise]\n\nWell that's it it's one way they can do it yes I mean what a lot of this and I've said this before or gets in the mid ... where they put it in GMO foods for one so you you get it from GMO foods\nYou get it from the Kim trails you get it from a where they put in the water supply or you don't think that if they are going to stick something like fluoride in in the water supply they're not going to pick something else in the water supply they most definitely are uh it's on the products ah it's on the products you buy\nA it's on the clothes you wear and it's all this data it's all about data okay so what they're doing is they're using particles to to get massive data on everybody and it goes beyond the you know you think you're on the Internet and they're not getting data and they're getting data on something that you have\nAnd or even your money has the little particles on it and the little metal wiring in it and so they can track you and figure out what's going on with it so they can track their money as well\nAbsolutely you know as as a you're physically track through the ether and the wife I feels that are generated or was reading off these things uh there was an article that come out here about a year ago or it might have been a little bit longer ago\nAbout how they can actually tell who the person is by their gate of them are walking oh younger the\nYeah the gate a also once again I think it was a few days ago we were talking about what is it\nTwo million a closed circuit TV cameras having to be installed in the United states for most of the smart grid cities and again for the surveillance apparatus wishing to\nPut in play a so not only do they have the cameras to see you they'll have a the data to have on you if they need to access that data through a ... you know I could call nanoparticle smart does evil dust like a a science called it but these are called modes is what the costs\nBut we'd be on the truth uh here in the small town that I reside in maybe about five thousand people they put up a three security cameras on the post office has three security cameras at the the the local park right\nAnd it's because we all want to save utopia smart city and it won't be our police either in the future will not be a he will not be the police were used to it will be forces that will be actually under the control and the police chiefs will answer to an autonomous robots that will make determinations as to who are threats and we weren't threats\nAs soon as part of what jade home was about jade home was a a Raytheon project it I mean a lot of other people said differently but we report it was a rape you on project to basically do a test run\nOn the grid system they were planning on putting in play with the ... system that they that everybody will soon be carrying with them if they're not carrying with them now\nBob slowly it makes me think are very much about ... and the well a USSL ridge and all of your familiar with this story\nOf going to be like a long time ago yeah awesome yeah well I you know I appreciate all your thoughts on this thank you so much for calling John\nThank you Bye bye bye speaking of John John Brennan\nTalks about how interested he is for the future and how to deliver\nCertain things by a\nStratospheric air assault injections here we go\nAnother example is the rate of technologies often referred to collectively as geo engineering\nThat potentially could help you versus the warming effects of global climate change one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric air assault injection or as a on a method of seeing the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat it much the same way that they'll connect the Russians do\n[noise] so that's a John Brennan and that's not out of context he was talking with the council on Foreign Relations and other body think tank that\nActually runs this country from the sidelines talking about the future for\nA strategic air assault inoculations injections it's certainly a a brave new world that's for sure it's\nGoing to Sam in Kansas Hi Sam you're on ground zero\nEnabling Clyde hey I'm Glad to hear your lady soon find hope you are as well\nYes and when you see here give her a big hug and kiss for me I Will definitely\nOkay um [noise] maybe you can answer this question and uh [noise] I don't know how knowledgeable you are about it and and my question is uh to get down to layman's terms basically\nUh you have these tiny microphones mhm and they broadcast a signal I mean it it's not necessarily a voice communication\nState of communication is all day that it has nothing to do with voice they don't listen to you but the data is kept on you so there'll be a data marking it'd probably be indefinite data but it certainly will be data on what the the the sensors are picking up all over the world\nOkay my question is also is it a receiver and transmitter or is it just a a transmitter\nMostly receiver but of course it's going to help with the Internet of things so yes there will eventually be a transmitter it's a way to integrate us into the machines and machine learning and\nDo it and everything if it isn't now it will be\nCan be yeah but at the moment they just wanted for day and it's it's basically data collection on everything including in er in er an inanimate objects like bridges and whether or not a road\nIncluding in er in er an inanimate objects like bridges and whether or not a road needs to be paved or whether or not there's a charcoal and the road that can detect that uh whether or not you know that sort of thing\nIf they can do that to inanimate objects they can do to people as well\nWell that's the whole point I mean they were able to ingest it and we get it through\nUm you know vaccines Kim trails GMO food things of that nature it's all there anyway and that's why people to say what kind of do to get rid of it that were nothing it's just like you know when you inhale a when you inhale particularly from a smokestack it goes into your body or liver has to process it\nAnd you're still alive and you're still breathing unless of course they say that living next to a smokestack is giving you black lung and then you can say well I can blame that company for giving me black lung everybody had been in them and now we're no reason to panic is being by that this is how they're going to be able to put sensors all over the world in two years\nSo then it's safe to assume that eventually they'll be able to manipulate you\nKnow maybe yeah but see that's the thing is I was talking with Ron during the break and he was a kind of blood but he was he was very serious it's like we say we know we could be kidding but we're very serious about what we're getting about\nHe said ... says the new investment is into memory setters he said if you invested in memory centers you will be a billionaire because memories centers of the new things to invest in\nSo they can control your metabolism they can control your thoughts and they can even convince you that you're sick\nWell that would be ideal be be behind quelled McCall program that's what the program was about the classified instilled conspiracy theory 'cause there's no way we can prove it otherwise it's all circumstantial evidence or you know a bet you speculative evidence when you're looking at a piece of paper that could've been forged are made up\nBut still it was out long before this ever became an issue\nAnd people were worried that are in fact they tried to dismiss it saying it's all a hoax but most of the people that were involved in bringing it to the public or either killed or died or committed suicide it's just amazing everybody there was a you know attached to this project or at least declassify or bring it to the public\nOr either killed or suicide it or what have you\nWell here's my thoughts yeah if it's broadcast [noise] it's possible to blow up the signal and it would may take a continuous electromagnetic pulse\nOregon ... you know but that the thing is that it is possible but then all they'd have to do is just dust again and ah and so you constantly would be struggling or having a a trouble to avoid it you know that only thing it it said it said data system\nThat is that collects data on everything so that they want data on you or or the the fire hydrant next to the house or how many times the the lamp turns on da da da da da da and permission\nWell and if you do manage the signal their equipment would tell them the signals being blocked\nSpirit catch grown or a ... cage maybe I don't know fairly cage that work at a thug with a criminal ballot\nPeople that drink on target and time again to tip I don't know why they would do that but uh yeah I was reading the other day people are drinking\nYou know gum turbans I'm I guess to get rid of them are good for you just get up well then they may not know do this at home because they know I was watching that no one I cannot believe anybody would drink serpentine I just now\nNo thank you well you're you know could affect your kidneys and your liver\nCharcoal water baby I don't know not terribly well\n... there's there's vinegar baking powder and baking soda\nBaking soda and vinegar of white wine vinegar red site or or apple cider vinegar I mean there are a lot of things I'm sure that will cleanse your body over and over again but every time they die every time they laid a trail\nEvery time you put something in your mouth and GMO you run the risk of getting these nano by now and certainly everybody is affected by it so I mean it's not like it's going to kill you tomorrow it's not like you should be scared it's not like you run in the bathroom put a finger in your mouth and do the whole\nYou know model losing weight routine just it's ... it's just something that I'm telling you this is how they're going to carry out their smart cities are smarter than they are
