gather together in a forest all the leaders of the world gather together and they gather under a horned\nOwl which of course people have called ...\nSimilar to what bale bale andme will look at the

you I'm a former atheist from the long extinct NASA study project and I'm now ... non denominational Christian a follower of Jesus Christ\nAnd I've come to the conclusion that tonight you have clearly articulated that divide and conquer strategy\nBut uh gee of the fallen angels I Believe God is allowing this to happen to test the will of land and what you were talking about is the most important subject that anyone can think about at this point in history and thank you for what you're doing\nRobot I I think you and I and I hope you're recognizing when I'm trying to say I think a lot of people are are shocked because they wanted to get into the division and the arguments over who's right news wrong but the truth of the matter is the snare is great and people are being drawn into it and it's going to create some of the darkest division\nI've ever seen in the history of my country and its be fighting fighting tooth and nail to get the information out there that yes symbolism matters that yes what we're seeing is subconsciously affecting that and I don't and and I don't want people who think this is crazy this is a reality when things don't fall into place like this you have to shake your head and say\nSomething dark as the foot here I Can't put my finger on it but we have to pay attention\nI agree with you one thousand percent\nMy research backs up everything you're saying I have quietly\nConnected the dots myself and tonight you are the voice of this reality and it takes discernment and it takes patience to peel back the layers of deception but tonight you know provided us all\nWithin insights and wisdom and have given a spiritual sunglasses\nTo help us to see it through the glare of demonic deception ... this is a project to divide and conquer a house divided will fall

Kansas Hi Mark you're on ground zero\nOh thank you yeah you know I'm I like a lot of what you say but I have to say\nI don't think the problem here is anything to do with a cold as a I I my my guess is that Ninety nine percent of the people in this country don't know bail some Bailey wire\nWell that's what my purpose is to teach the country the difference between bail and bailing where\nWell now there's nothing wrong with that but uh my problem is I think the problem is the ignorance of the American people didn't realize that only about one third of American citizens can pass the citizenship test\nYeah that they give to people that want to become citizens yes I Know people under thirty it's right around twenty percent\nAnd many don't even know what's in the constitution they notify parts of the first to them and they don't know a lot of things about their constitution they don't know how the voting system works they don't know how they're going to walk away a lot of Americans are going to walk away from his cabinet forward situation\nDismayed and wondering how it all went down the way it did and they thought they were on the right team and they certainly will wonder how did this happen and it's because they don't pay attention to the nuances that are being thrown at them\nI'm taking from the cult perspective which is something that I was noticing some of the cold a phrase allergy\nHand signals things of that nature numbers play in fact\nI mean nine eleven you name it they're all there\nAnd people who have been talking about been we've been hinting at them we finally ... ah you know we're we're close to the mark of what was going on here some people disagree saying that I was up in the night and crazy but no you can go back and everything that I had brought up since the beginning of September ... since the beginning of his hearing has happened\nAnd I didn't talk about the arch of building in recognizing we said it once in passing but this arch was directed at everything that arch represents is everything is being talked about in this hearing\nEverything nothing is overlooked everything is being broadcast and somehow I think this this arch whenever it is is a transmitter bringing forward all the darkness and pain that it will after this whole voting system is done\nWith a cabinet becoming chief justice\nOh I don't disagree with that but let my thinking is the best defense against all this crap what is the truth and I think the Bible says the truth will set you free\nYeah Bill ... first\nWell that's that's the start of the process\n[laughter] ain't that [laughter]\nI'm Glad you're willing to take the take the ah the strikes my friend I Am glad [laughter]\nNo no I I don't disagree with they said but ah but you know these people that are saying that America was never great they either live fools that's my opinion\nYeah I I remember America One time being great I Know that we've had our downs and we've had our ups but never has it been like this to where I worry about the decision of appointing a chief justice to the Supreme Court\nYeah even even even when Anita Hill and the people are still great without him and I worry about well\nAnd who plays in the government but those who do these medieval power plays and they love to throw their worship to a unknown guides and unknown powers and they've done it forever and we let it happen and then when something goes down and say oh come on and that's all going since well that'd be a coincidence and I wouldn't\nBe surprised at all there are some people in the government that that are a washed up some of these false God's I couldn't believe that at all but as it once we start paying attention and I think that's happening I think things are going to get better\nWell we can only get better that way I see much worse well that's true I mean look short term pass this long term often is in the beginning we see in front of us an obstacle we must leave over that obstacle we must remove that obstacle we we must never\nEver put ourselves in that position again but the trouble is as you say going back to your education argument people do not learn from history they don't feel they need to know history they don't learn from history and that is why we're in the situation we're in right now\nIt's really bad I was watching that I was watching it on one of the stations and they were given these people the tests to set a ship and this was a woman that had an advanced degree shaded not know she could not lane three countries that we imposed in World War two\nReally shit which which war general Eisenhower thought in I mean that's just that just blows my mind\nPeople don't pay attention to his dream world history American history and they don't know why they believe the way they believed they just believe\nYeah to me to me it's a problem education like I said I I think the truth will set you free\nWell keep telling the truth there mark appreciate that will do that All right thank you so much\nFor what you do you take care Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA thinks every three thirty seven hundred\nHe's just an

the\nBase all over the it's all over the area in Brussels wherever the European Union is that and then they had the the twelve stars the crown of the of the woman a battle on\n'em in the European Union flag you see the woman to Babylon writing the beast and therefore you're you feed on tapestries all over the place and then they have an unfinished looking building that replicates or at least books like the tower battle they're they're they're just open about\nHow they're using that symbolism the symbolism of the apocalypse to bring about the government's they want and the synergy they wish to tap into it and they're tapping into the dark forces the confidence strictures bitter bitter or old demons like time on as Modi is I could go down the list of all the demon did they decide

choose rather than being forced into slavery under under the direction of God Satan wanted slavery or he wanted to slavery of man uh and and God didn't want that he wanted they wanted a savior he wanted to wanted someone to come down and save\nThe people from their sins because of the original fans of the problems\nThat came about in the in the ... so I mean you want to get even by that but that\nThat's what makes no sense to me though you know what I'm saying because of that or or or or what do you know there's this despises evil why would they created in the first place\nAnd the argument is always drawn up you know I mean I come from a family of eight and half of us are are like me you know and the other apps and very devout and they say well of course you know it's because of free will but if that does not want you know ... or you know\nIt it's okay here's the deal he created opposition to engender strength that's the reason why opposition exists you wouldn't be strong without opposition you wouldn't gain\nYou wouldn't gain muscle without opposition you wouldn't gain fire without friction there's got to be in opposition to make things happen and the choices whether or not you wish to go with the opposition or fight against the opposition\nWas out there and I think that what the power of dabble yeah um how you know man like you know it the way that the scriptures says that you know a less man becomes like us you know we should separate them somehow you know of course they people were given different languages that they couldn't understand each other right\nBut the thing that I've always wondered is is that every single geographic area of the earth\nPeople or to stay with different until they started you know ... lake together and solve some ways it's got to make is got to make in over the course of a couple of thousand years man couldn't have evolved you know into the states different character\nLanguage ... language was a protection mechanism that's why it changed that's why they were different languages because of the scattering of the people they needed languages can be different in order to protect themselves it was a protection mechanism in the beginning\nNow it's not we we we inter relate with one another but in the past it was the idea of using language is a barrier to keep the enemies away and to have those were of your same kind learning the language is and the codes in the hands gestures it's just like the secret meeting I'm Talking about tonight with the esoteric knowledge\nThere's esoteric speak their esoteric signs symbols and sign posts and symbols mean a lot to people and and to argue that they don't I think is is is completely ignorant because when you say\nLike for example if I were a swastika into an elementary school I'm sure that I Would be escorted out handcuffed and thrown in jail but see that's the thing is it a swastika used to be an eastern philosophical symbol the Indian cultures\nWould uh have a swastika as their symbol but since it's been hijacked by the Nazis you can't wear it but the symbol means something to somebody and it means different things to different people with a by ... by a where across people will say well obviously he's a Christian\nAnd yet if you were if you were a ... gram they'll say well obviously euro which the ... used to represent what the cross represented ... at it until after the crucifixion\nSo I didn't know that\nAnd so yeah I mean see that's the thing because it represented the they had their hands outstretched and the legs sprayed turning it upside down in birds that so they head is in the ground and the bottom you split up word same with the upside down ... it was the same principle that you\nWouldn't hurt the head and the arms and it perverts a perverse the meaning of what the symbol is\nSo if you know anything a symbolic gee\nYou know that this arch is very symbolic of something that is being talked about right now in Washington D. C. and for some reason it may on an unconscious level be creating this type of controversy even though the the the object is is there in front of us\nHe wasn't there in front of us Thirty years ago\nFor judge Kavanaugh he just all of a sudden showed up on the radar and people wonder why well because the ritual and trap and smear was set in that is why now we're in the midst of this decision wants to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "College Station", "day": "05"}
