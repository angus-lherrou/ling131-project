the cholesterol or the party or ... or ... or ... people at a ... uh\nIt was supposed to be that way I mean political parties were just affiliations they they they weren't supposed to become a way of life for some sort of cult like following\nWhich we've developed here in this country now and as I said before the reasons why we're doing this now is because the media is encouraged it\nA fairness doctrine a has been removed so therefore uh this type of thing can continue uh there's no even killed reporting of of either side\nSo both sides have the ability to skew or or at least a you know changes story or put finishing touches or exclude parts of the story to fit their ah I guess you'd call their ideological criteria\nSo if you lean conservative you'll hear stories but you'll go wow that's surprising they're saying this about this you'll never hear I have never heard a show or or any anything for that matter where conservatives are featured where they actually say something surprising\nOr any anything for that matter where conservatives are featured where they actually say something surprising\nA I've never heard a show or liberals are featured where they don't really say something surprising meaning that they they find themselves leaning towards a certain type of topic they would usually be considered conservative or conservatives lean towards the topic that they would certainly see as liberal I've never seen that before everything is so retailer yeah everything is so rigid minded and so it's so myopic\nThat we can see what other people are feeling we just have our biases in our biases are enough to get us through the de\nLa la la la ... expect to get a caller CFOs you the older older lady uh she thought you might have an awful lot of well yeah ... yes I'm a\nI mean you can convince this woman that no but you are trying to explain herself she just wants to hear that all day\nBecause I I said I said that was my statement was\nI said that I think the President Trump will be the first oh actually the first and last president\nTo stand up but you went to stand up to the un like you did and she didn't like that or she didn't like me saying that he would be the last president because you won't there'll be president after President Trump I said well yes of course there will be but they're not going to be as bold is to stand up to the un I don't think\n[noise] [noise] yeah that's right\nNow that like club all heading a just ignorance really um I guess it\nGoes across all age groups but I just below the way to people all over the all the solace all of this country could ever see is what people well lighted together right\nWell see I just I've always I've always believed trends that there is power in dialogue and I think the dialogue should be allowed\nAnd uh it should be allowed without insults without cut downs and without a you know that was biased to the point where there's no argument to be had people now speak their opinions as if they are a fact\nThat is that it's something that we picked up on over the last few years but just because you have an opinion on something does it make it real we've always heard the statements speak your truth well that means your truth is exclusive truth\nNo truth is truth released it used to be but now speaking your truth is exclusive truth do you\nNot the real truth that pits you off when you hear it because no one wants to hear the ugly truth they just want to hear troop that makes them feel good and the truth is that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump recently said that there would be violence Trump's that there'd be violence if\nThe Republicans did not win the Senate and Hillary Clinton says there will be continued instability unless they do when Joe unless the or the Democrats do win\nSo both of them it's kind of said that well we know what everybody is going to do and and and they're not saying don't do that they're not saying don't they're just say this is going to happen it's like it's inevitable witty and that's the thing that bothers me about this\nYear we have no choice but yet it's going to happen regardless whether you bought a lot\nWell and we're already seeing we're already seeing the the the uh the aftermath of this I mean the the the left wing media saying if you ever been to a Trump rally it's a mob and then he said well if you ever see what happened during the Kavanaugh hearing it was a mob\nAnd uh they're all saying it's not a mob anti thoughts about a mob you know and what are you saying there protesting there protesting peacefully but pounding on the doors in screaming and yelling and end up costing people in the blocking traffic and then telling some white guy in a car that he's white by a white guy I mean it's just the insanity it doesn't make any sense\n[laughter] it was set up better Clyde or just keep on keep on doing what you're doing and I'll be let's say I appreciate\nThat thank you so much uh I I got this from surely I call my biases my values I'm biased on my morals\nAnd values and there's no compromise no biases are not moral they're just not I disagree biases are not morals biases you can have biases that are based on nonsense that doesn't make them right in order to make the moral morality is when you do good to others morality is when you do good to yourself morality is when you love God morality is\nWhen you continue to spread hope and and you and you're a person who believe in being up right in straight\nAnd understanding what it means to be a frightening straight a good American

story that is one of them Alex Jones or climate is talking about this Google Search or that I call it yes you call this a strange thing is that the algorithm\nOr what what what I say about it is that Google gather information all the time but not really for our good\nBut it's just the Chinese have a you know the inside scoop and Google it would be really easy for them\nThe Chinese have a you know the inside scoop and give it all\nIt would be really easy for them to figure out what our forces are because I work in construction and so they are up in Berlin and here I talked to these we sell to all these military people up here and then I talked to him all the time and our searches for a job you know seeing what they're going to do after they're out\nBut they're searching while they're actually in the military and that would be just real for somebody to say\nI Want to know where all their forces are as they're going out as a reserve\nIt kind of tells you that you know the guy goes in there and fills out there\nWhere they would have that anyway Robert even have that any way with hacking and backdoor a Trojan horses they'd be able to\nDo that with a you know certain types of malware a\nBright yes there's exactly they can get into Google at any time but all the information that's just come up lately here this new algorithm to do this military placing sure though\nAnd when they apply for it I'm sure they get Mahler information you know Sam what all that stuff they're looking for but it's like if you are if you were in now and you had military Claire says\nAnd say you come out here reservists they could actually ... issue and physicians where\nThey could literally put you through anybody they want it to literally bringing them for ... years without even knowing that you know\nRobert hold on one moment Ronnie ... can you hear me are they asking to evacuate the building oh [laughter] oh okay All right I just turned an alarm go off and I heard evacuate the building [noise] I'm not kidding and Enron article you're out and run for higher to test so it's just the test they have good because\nI just turned ... evacuate the building and I'm like whoa what's going on okay so they're doing a test in my building to evacuate I don't know why they were doing that I don't know I just want to know did they want us to move back he's one time I'll tell you the truth Robert I was in the building that was on\nFire and I did my show even though we are now because I didn't hear the evacuation notice it was ... very yeah basically what is the dumpsters downstairs in the in the uh in in the area where they are called the vehicles were on fire and that was in the concrete area but it was burning and smoke and I noticed there was smoking there does again hold on\nHold on wait a minute\nOkay that was because they are they doing it no okay gosh freaking me out here okay I hear the tone and then all of a sudden I hear evacuate the building and vacuuming so they're doing an evacuation drills here where we are\nOne of those spirit Bernie Mac\nIt's just crazy Robert thank you so much for your call ... by by is\nThere anything else that can happen tonight that would really you know scare the hell out of me I mean first of all when they hear the evacuation\nWere glittering all over the country with a\nGym there jamming on it it is it okay good I'm just hoping that this this feels like a really bad dream it really does okay\nLet's go to Chris in California Hi Chris you're on ground zero\n[noise] they take a breath quiet [laughter] [laughter] I'm pretty sure I'll tell you I've been listening\nTo you for for ... I'll tell you there's some of the patterns that I've noticed is going on with us says all the tech stuff started going all crazy and censoring and stuff and it's been mostly censoring this conservative side and\nAll of a sudden I started to notice 'cause I got a I've recently gotten into the stock market I've noticed that a lot of the big\n... now have been getting hit with like these penalties in science like go like ... like Nineteen billion in one day\nSo I think it's kinda a you know you have like\n... the social media side is mainly being pushed by the liberal side where are you know big business has always been associated with the Republican side you know conservative side so I gotta feeling that\nWhat's going on especially today because I mean you had you know call for violence on the right call for violence on the left and now all of a sudden\nBoom\nYou know they drop down everything you know all of the big tech giants they lost\nBillions today in the stock market but everything else is fine all like all the construction industry is and and uh you know all various other ... other a stock you know stock portfolio and stuff like that the only thing that really hit super hard\nWas all the giant techs so it could be\nWell Bush is the reason why that is ... ... what would they know they know that the technological platforms in this country are shaping culture they know the algorithms are shaping culture and I played some things last night about algorithms I think that maybe we should rethink\nAbout how computers televisions and shows and things because in reality it it's really screwing up how we think\nAnd I find it interesting though that after what Trump said in what Hillary Clinton said about civility in about violence did that Facebook's response was okay we're going to remove both conservative and liberal sites that are extreme to removing a hundred of those\nAnd then added than a memo comes out of Google saying oh and by the way we're now only going to a look at the tone of what is being\nNow how are they going to look at every site and say we're going to look at the tone know what the good news you can put parameters in their in their box if you put parameters and their algorithms to figure out the type of words that are being used in a website to determine whether or not it's racist or hateful uh and and that's how they're going to\nDo it [laughter] it's it's actually funny 'cause I literally just got off a three day a Facebook jail time\nFor uh making making a joke about a somebody brought up something about like um it was something about a Black Sea Ford and ah you know oh and it was like no I'm not saying that this that all women live this woman's life and basically my joke back was well you know what\nPeople say Lizzie Borden killed her parents does that mean that all women are serial killers\nAnd then boom I literally the algorithm and pick me up and gave me a free day jail sentence right wow\nThe that's the [laughter] ... yeah and and I know is if you read it if it I mean come on it at\nThat time was totally satirical joke\nWell invite the thing the bill the algorithms reading what you're writing and they'd say well and and they'll always uh there's something else too that ah I've been called on to buy a Google\nAnd that is that a Google ah basically ah came after me once for doing something called scraping\nAnd so what that ... well I I Do know from my show okay I write notes from my show and they put ... on my on my regular website\nWell when I also do they go back to a lot of old articles like articles that are like maybe twenty or Thirty years old and I've written Twenty years old actually and I've written them and I go back and see if I can find something and I I I wrote something about it a long time ago so I go back and find the information I wrote about a long time ago I put it in the article for my notes and it was actually\nA ... I'm I'm Sorry 'cause there was actually an author that got picked up by I think it was like the FBI started investigating him because he was a writer and he was doing a a a a novel about cereals a serious some serial killer novel and Google pick them up\nBecause he was like literally searching serial killers mhm [laughter]\nThat's ... ... it's a ... it's a it's an algorithms doing that so you got to be careful about how you form your sentences you got to say exactly no you can't say anything that would even a appear to be or even misconstrued\nYou can't say anything that would even appear to be or even misconstrued as being the ministry of true it is the ministry of truth I think it's just totally administer truth and it's so sad it's exactly what it is yeah it's the ministry of truth and that's and that's why you know when you talk about this\nYou know people who will go you know it and they basically have their politics for their biases and use they look\nThings are said and then actions are done and what actions are done we try to figure out why the actions you've done it they're done because I have a feeling that both Facebook and Google realized that what they're doing is they're creating an atmosphere for civil war and we'll let me when\nWe hear earlier today aren't leaders saying things like well there will be violence or if uh you know we don't win and the other one says we're we're going to continue to be\nA not civil in feel we win\nThis is how the ... jacks up the motion and that's why they're trying to do it they're just trying to play but\nWe're real quick 'cause I hear the music okay do you think Trump and Hillary actually working together in order to have to make the civil war happening and then bam all of a sudden we have the whole global is just the martial law they looked at both no idea\nI don't think that's a that's a good conspiracy theory but I have no idea [noise]\nHave a great pleasure thank you thank you [noise]\nSo many Daniels said though that when they were together for arguably or allegedly together that he was talking to her about plan [noise]\nHome for ... bucks every three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens\nWhen you call ... life\nFor example Georgia's forty he was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes Mets to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select quote agent dance to be you know and believe me\nTip of athletics toxic seen twenty WTO W\nImagine the media with no conservatives are well that's what we have before rush rush Limbaugh delivered on WTO W College Station Bryan\n\nThe cleanup ...

be see us and we think it matters WG a W College Station Bryan [noise]\n\nHere's a revelation that somebody just sent me and it's true I didn't really think about this for the moment when savers [noise] and\nUh [noise] try to figure out why and wondering if we're ever get back\nTo [noise] have you noticed\nThat the mainstream liberal News I'm talking about MSNBC and CNN or no longer talking about Russian collusion have you noticed that in the newspaper it's no longer\nA news point is not part of the talking points today\nKavanaugh killed it Michael killed it and and now Hillary Clinton back with a spotlight on her has killed it\nBut yet we're seeing the meddling going on between both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both talking about possible violent tendencies or activities and the mob speaking of the mob as they say\nGroups like al ... and other groups that are basically protesting and tearing down walls and doing all kinds of things so you know very habits\nThings are changing and uh yeah I'm\nBeginning to wonder what's going on it's gonna roads in Ohio high road from ground zero\nHuh look good on a lake [noise] girl and she [noise] you're right about\nThat [noise] I I\nI just wanted to be for a whole week or so ago and it's like well that's right and that's another reason this is difficult in relation to make\nSense to anybody relate any\nYou know what I'm saying if the person is just you know\nWell and and we're running into a lot of confusion and and we're a lot of misunderstanding and a lot of other crazy things and ah I think it's because of the fact that once again we have to you know ask ourselves or we pretty much going to you know just\nStay by the biases are we going away things out for what they truly are and that is if you're not seeing any meddling going on with Russia or we're not seeing any meddling going on with any other group and now you see how Facebook and Google have taken a complete three sixty turn around you know you go in and remove all kinds of sites on Facebook\nBecause I'm sure there are all responding what Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump said so now they're saying well we got to remove these sites because it's you know creating a ... a what we call the political or a political mess and then Google turns around and they say well what we're going to do now is we're just going to send out our boss or algorithms to look at the tone of the voices\nHow they're how they're voicing their opinions we don't want to create any more fury with our subscribers\nWhich means that I think they know or they've been put on notice that they have been helping and creating this anger in this hatred in the country\nAnd that uh it's all because of the people are tired of being silence that doesn't mean they're not going to stop their silencing\nIn fact I had a friend of mine told me I just tonight that uh she was attempting to put something on my site and it was erased right after she put it up\nUh in fact there was another uh actually there was another email I got to where apparently uh someone had put something up or on my Facebook page and I can't remember what it was all I'll have to\nFind it over there it is right there since you're a few minutes ago after writing on messenger or Facebook sent me a warning of content because I had a comment my comment line was\nA rebuild the u._s._a. and now the page has been polled so you know they're really they're they're algorithms and Bob the really active tonight going after people who are\nWanting to make political statements about saving the United states because you know I think that these words that both President Trump and Hillary Clinton said have triggered a lot of attention\nIt triggered my attention and that's where I tried to attempt to talk about two nights ago\nBut now it's captured the attention of media some of the media the New York post the Google Facebook the number of groups now and so you notice that one type of meddling has left us and now a new type of meddling is here\nAnd then maybe a server was right when she said maybe some people are whispering in their ear to say this because it's it's really the needs to be said putting everybody\nInto a new form of government which you know could be could be an interesting a theory it is I think\nThe other you know speaking of nine one one or wait a minute we'll put out there\nOn the phones yeah mhm\nI I don't have sophisticated so and I was wondering if it was it a true yeah triggers people\nWell the John you hear on the radio triggers people\nIt's a pulsing tone it's been to trigger impulses that's why uh\nI don't know if you know this but uh you are not allowed in any circumstances to play that tone other ... of the other than for emergency broadcast and the reason why I Know this is because we used to use it in a ground zero in ... a long time ago and we were threatened with a fine if we continue to use that so there's something magical about B. E. A. S.\nTones that you are you here when they weren't even said something very special about\nWell came first player top of me I have [noise] I have to change that radio down or off because they have here and get up\nYet I can get to the point where I learned in that area where I put in there we don't want you to give up we want you to listen I think he wrote that well thank you\nHave a good night yeah that's the story of the the opening theme it's all about giving up when the loudspeaker says ground zero they want you to give up we've already had our ground zero we had back\n... okay friendly things will call you will\nGo down and Brett in Michigan Hi Brett you're on ground zero\n[noise] hey try it man [noise] [noise]\nUh you know I recall a presidential up a tree by a fellow Andrew creek mhm uh was interviewed by what strict ... remember ...\nBefore he died he yeah he was building brings worst nightmare\nYeah yeah and then and so Andrew Craig presidential up a tree and others uh there's a YouTube presentation the wars in sheep's clothing right um\nAnd then there's ... there's another one everyone needs to see a one hundred secret societies per who rules America all these these agent at such as William Colby stated to a congressional\nCommittee when was that ... was that Seventy four Seventy five million Kobe was probably the only truly honorable righteous\nCIA men we've ever had\nAt least in my lifetime that I can recall because he said look or all of the power gatekeeper physicians throughout the entire media complex is populated with\nC. I. A. controller approaches well the way it kind of out in the church hearing\nOkay thank you yeah give 'em [noise] and then let's see who was it a a\nA was a weird it was a twentieth elect over Seventy seven uh it was a feature article in Rolling Stone or know Carl Bernstein talking about CIA and the media\n[laughter] okay so here we are hills of east Clinton east uh\nUh when she was secretary secretary of state Clyde you remember February of twenty fourteen you mentioned a quarter okay so in that very same month or a quarter\nWas supposed to indicted high level folks um HSBC\nHonoring Hong Kong remember that HSBC right for money laundering operations at all and there was that I read though of a Baker's that were mysteriously dying committing suicide whatever remember that\nYes that was one I remember when that happened I was saying well it's just like the dirty war because bankers and people involved with a against wandering the money but who were killed\nYeah man and then we add you know how could we forget a good oh\nOur trip patriot Ollie north right right you know hey we gotta stop does or\nWhatever or was the Sandinistas relate to and yet the biggest drug smuggling operators are on the planet of from various sources including a man I Wish you could interview this guy real muggy okay\nWe interviewed someone better we interviewed the guy who remember when ah that ah you know there was a chip paying them we interviewed ... murder ... yeah it was a runner if Iran Contra we interviewed him back when we were talking about panic and\nWhether or not he was running a guns for the CIA ah and that's why a in Las Vegas everything went wrong so okay you know we're all about that stuff on the corruption so yes we know that that's\nThat whenever something happens like this you're talking about you know agencies in what have you\nAnd you'll find out I think we'll find out in the\nVery end Indian Game here is that it's the agency's bitter manipulating everything not as the disease here in the United states but agencies\nAll over the world that there is a ball of intelligence ops that are doing this to every country that they see that they can actually bring down okay and that and that's been that's been something that's been a conspiracy theory of mind for a long time\nAnd I've never really talked about it but um\n'cause I don't consider myself a conspiracy theorist but I Do have my own theories that I've made and one conspiracy theory that I have about this whole Russian meddling thing that I never really got to because it really wasn't relevant as as relevant as it could be later on\nHis bat the deep state that we talk about is not\nA a deep state that has devoted to one party or another I mean does it most the most conservatives would have you believe the deep saved a bunch of liberal you know bastards in there I I Want to bring down Trump no no no no the deep state is the ... agents from all over the world that want to bring down the United states\nOf America is a bigger bigger\nThat they want to topple has nothing to do with Trump the only reason why they're going after Trump is because Trump is easy reason why Trump is easiest because Trump as a nationalist and they can immediately discredit him as some nationalist white supremacist Bozo and it'd be easy to do because he loves to play into it and he loves to\nGet the media all worked up and stuff\nBut the tree out matter is the deep state that I talk about and then I personally think he's is is a deep state that is worldwide and the worldwide cabal of agencies and agents are the ones that are trying to bring Trump\nWide and the worldwide cabal of agencies and agents are the ones that are trying to bring Trump down not some it's not some left wing conspiracy of Kelly ... you can be on Conway's said the Christian I'm poor through it a Hillary Clinton and she rebounded with well civility blah blah blah blah blah you know it is a worldwide phenomenon\nAnd and there are plenty of allies you can call them that have agents both with the European Union Israel Saudi Arabia does go down the list\nThat are there to topple our government and that\nDeclined you're kissing ... man genetically speaking there kissing cousins\nWell see that's the whole point it's like you know what Star Wars but family feud right to say about it about it a star wars is based primarily on bloodlines fighting one another okay they're all related in some way for instance layers uh loops a sister\nA Luke is is a addict can Scott Walker's ... a son in the sky walkers Darth Vader it's all a family affair I wouldn't be surprised if like Ben can be have a hand in this way or\nOr what's your name or the new one not ... but the the girl what's her name ray or you know it it it it's just a family and says to his family of bloodlines fighting for planets in this world it's fighting for one planet which is of course a spaceship that goes through space every day about three hundred sixty five days or go round our son\nAnd they want the steering wheel to take over the spaceship and pilot the way they want to and there are plenty of secret societies in the background\nThat you know they're they're the guys that were the woods and you look at you say oh they're like senators and their their their ah presidents and princesses in rulers but in reality they go in their little little enclaves and they're all like to know sixty minutes they do a hundred\n... America is Elaine ... then it it ceases anti the sister says it's All right it's all these paradigms you know it's your interfaith scene yeah it's all claim to keep us in theater fake little appearing real\n... dialectic is how they rule now it's always about hey there's a problem but what are we going to do about it we'll we'll give you the solution and where the guys who created the problem the first place we'll give you the evolution of recreated the problem that power\nClay I got to tell you a couple of nights\nAgo you're you're you're you're like citing scripture tells Sagan in his cause most serious way back when I remember a Patrick Stewart came on at the very top of this episode he said\nThe old coal heaven and earth to witness it gives you this day that I said before the light of death the blessing and a curse therefore choose to light that don't may is live and I see I thought you know that sounds scriptural and I'm like Catholic what do I know but I'm Glad I got into a good book one died\nAnd voted doodle enemy thirty late teens we have a choice like your wife she was giving back she was trying to help out in in what was reward you know that's great to the public trust well that's a\nBroken heart more than the assault that that believe it or not the revoking a public trust because she works in a position where she knows where the public trust is very important where being in control of a situation is more important than being out of control the situation like I say intellectual beauty that's my wife will be back [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino iron works safe at rhino safe dot com American Made an antique styled our safe sharp part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you're like the classic look of our rhino fireworks apes we also feature beautiful matching tool chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers and a huge network\nAcross the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and most convenient safe with great surface and warranties and you can get online financing so go what's the best", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "College Station", "day": "12"}
