Scott south pole station it's in an article and uh the University of Wisconsin is a group that I uh basically runs that Madison, Wisconsin University of Wisconsin Madison\nAnd then there's the ... brewery neutrino observatory located in the form of a mind complex near suddenly Ontario\nAnd it's operated by a group called snow lab okay\nSo we used to be a tree no detecting facilities or exist and they're in in various places around the globe but I find interesting is that they have one in an article called the ice cube and they're they're they're trying to detect neutrinos but recently there was a story in Scientific American that indicated\nThat something was happening what actually was happening in in the Antarctica the Macy ... even seal the deal on populations restaurant communication or actually a signature left behind by extraterrestrials\nOr there are bizarre particles to keep flying out of an article size and they may shattered modern physics reserved neutrinos they are there are special kinds of neutrino\nAnd physicists don't know what what they are exactly but they do know it's uh it comes about in some sort of cosmic ray high energy particles blasted its way through space in the beer\nAnd then back out of whole yet and and so this isn't an article something comes in at the top of the planet comes out of Antarctica\nBut the particles that are coming out a physicist are saying this is going to change the standard model of\nPhysics if uh we find out\nOr why these are these particles are doing or something they don't normally do I mean see\nYou know when you're looking at the standard model model of particle physics these nano particles were these neutrinos or whatever they may be they shouldn't be able to do what they do but they're doing so I mean look there are low energy neutrinos that can pierce through miles upon miles of rocket affected but\nThese are high energy neutrinos as weather\nAs well as fighting a detecting other high energy particles [noise] they have large cross sections that means they almost always crashing something soon after zipping into earth and never make it out the other side but [noise] this has been going on since March twenty sixteen [noise]\nOkay [noise]\nMarch of twenty six teams [noise]\nNow do you remember\nWhat happened in February [noise]\nI'm twenty six team [noise] remember what happened with that [noise] well a refresher memory barely there were a lot of people have thought that aliens and landed\nIn Antarctica and maybe they kinda have [noise] but uh I'll tell you about the timeline here\nAbout a month before the discovery or the month after discovered it was a month after the discovery\nOkay we talked about the species that they found there from Boston\nSo uh I mean\nI don't know if you remember back when we talked about the problem is new bacterium in an article that can survive solely up the chemicals in the air um big and live off formaldehyde other other things will be toxic in carcinogenic to us are really bad\nFor us but uh these organisms to just survive off hydrogen and carbon monoxide and they can live off carbon dioxide which makes the extreme of files a and these microbes can\nWhich makes the extreme of files a and these microbes can't survive in some of the most extreme conditions that exist on our planet these organisms are so unique they're opening up the potential for finding alien life because now that we know organisms can exist only chemicals in the air\nExtraterrestrial life could exist in much wider and Wilder circumstances\nThan previously thought it'd be ... they reconstructed some of the genomes of twenty three microbes and they're able to identify two species a previously undiscovered bacteria\nThey are they're known as W PS two in eighty three or they were living in the soil there in an article the other species these bacteria survive with little sunlight know geothermal energy and extremely limited nutrients\nIs mostly German bacteria these are the first life forms ever discovered that survive by just eating components of the air so I mean this demonstrates to how life can still exist\nIn physically extreme and nutrient starved environments you don't need all the uh the the building blocks we need to survive they found that these things would survive as well so you have neutrinos that could be a signature of perhaps something radioactive or some radioactive exhaust okay that doesn't belong on this planet\nYou've got species of bacteria that live in extreme conditions that wouldn't be able to live in the condition is around ... they may be able to living conditions on space a moon somewhere\nYou've got a Russian uh a Russian patriarch you got secretary of state you got a number of people Buzz Aldrin astronaut going down there to see what's going on\nI Believe something happened something has happened many times over and they're still trying to figure out what they discovered\nAnd those sounds was Cosby sounds you're hearing is part of the big part of the equation\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred go to Jim in Oregon Hi Tim you're on ground zero\n... doing doing good man good hey that that second sounding he played a out of Utah I'm I just recently heard is similar to that when we were hunting last week up in the ... national forest outside of pride though really\nYeah and I didn't I didn't really put it altogether it till I was listening to the show tonight and uh around the same time we heard those noises they sounded a little bit further away it sound as loud as a as what your play on the radio right but um\nRight after we heard those cells there was military aircraft in the area each time that was a single flyby and that was that was it\nWe're part about it it was in an area where we normally see a lot of animals there was none we didn't we didn't see any deer that was out there that we normally see as well\nYou know would you know in that area they were doing any kind of electromagnetic experiments 'cause I Know in the Olympic Peninsula or in\nWashington and Libya they're doing the electro they're doing electromagnetic testing in warfare or they're in in the forests are on the Olympic Peninsula\nI have no idea\n... years so it was quiet where you were and you heard that sound\nYeah yeah it was it was a lot more ... than that what you were played on the radio it almost sounded like it was kind of far off in the distance but it was definitely a recognizable\nWas it in the sky and I think it was up in the sky or wouldn't somewhere at down below\nIt kind of sound like it was coming from all around okay it was really kind of hard to place it we're we're way up on top of them out so it it you know the the sound kind of plays tricks on your ears up there but it's super silent I mean there's there's nothing around up there for miles\nSo you're talking about the ... sound the sound that sounded the more electronic yes okay well the other one does too it's kind of a rumble low rumble when you listen to it just depends I guess your speakers what it sounds like but uh\nI was I was wondering you know I Would come over on the radio but I Know that a ... who is definitely the hunger Doug way uh is pretty amazing it did sound to it just sounds like you just if you heard it for too long a period of time it'd be an earworm you know what I'm saying\nIs this just further off it was it was a lot more fate but actually the first time I heard it I thought that maybe there was a vehicle qualify and I sat and I listen I realized it wasn't a vehicle it was that hunting kind of ...\nLet me play one more time so people can get the idea of of what you're talking about here to Tim said he heard a noise\nHe said he heard the news when he was out hunting and this has been noisier broke\n\nAnd that ... that was the noise Tim right that was the one you ... and ... and where were you again what what forest what mountains range where he went\nOut out of ... we were at ... national forest it's a kind of south east of the Oregon\nPine bill painful Oregon okay um what what county is that in you know\nA lot to say that's probably still Cook County\nOkay All right well just trying to figure out I'm I'm also trying to pinpoint this this uh meaty or the the blow up a in a in a ... a man last night and a number of people said that they saw it but nobody reported it so\nHe was doing a lot of uh you know just for my own you know place of origin I got to\nFigure out what happened but yeah the sounds and the the explosions and and then the other one was in Norway so that's another thing in mountainous area in Norway too so it makes me wonder what this all is\nRight right ... thank you so much for your call thank you thank\nYou Bye bye let's go to John calling in from Texas tonight I John you're on ground zero\nOkay ...\n... is this to be some sort or word she she bought\nMe a little space ship\nYou mean like your ship that's in trouble you think yeah like a shift trap Monday was all sort of false well\nWhat the okay look what you're talking about the neutrinos there that scientists are saying that the neutrinos are coming from space\nAnd they're entering on a in the north pole and coming out the south pole\nSo it's a it's a what it is is it's some sort of a a\nNuclear I guess you could call it a lot of particles that are being released bitter that that that had never been seen on this planet ... their neutrinos that are basically\nAre not the typical model so they're thinking that they're thinking that this may be some sort of a ... signature or decay signature and that it's been left by something they don't know yet what\nOkay I I was just guessing you\nKnow I mean it's a good guess I'm just trying to figure out though if you if there was a ship or something above the planet who's leaving behind these neutrinos it could be a distress call could be help us you know we're down and or or or something you see that's the thing is that Saturday and many right now are trying to figure out how they're going to determine what counts as an extraterrestrial signal\nAnd I think they've got so many they don't know how to they don't know how to interpret them\nAll\nThe stress\nIf if your stress low all is the one hell of a distress All right you know all\nAbout anyway and Charlie Kelly spice rigid in an article in a\nNo they're originating in space but coming out in an article on the planet is somehow being\nUsed as a transmitter for these\nBeyond the model neutrinos are coming out [noise]\nPlanted the south and which is kind of funny when you think about so John thanks for the Gulf of somebody's going in coming

sixteen twenty WTO O. W. College Station Bryan [noise] I'm always used to ground zero civil Ralph's in Oregon Hi Rob Dunn zero [noise]\nI think you guys nailed it [noise] when I last [noise] yeah I I think that's what's going on down there [noise] uh I was\nGoing to talk about the inter galactic cloud that we're going through right now but I think that's a that's another topic that you should discover some other time that's why the sun was looking kind of where these days and some of the weather and stuff but\nI just had two interesting ideas of the sounds on the earth one you know or the earth is moving you know we're we're moving pretty fast right through the through the a solar system right I mean there were spinning we're moving\nWhat if there were some times it was almost like a whistle or a hum going on and that was picked up almost like a a flute or something like a fluke is probably\nThe wrong and what made you want yeah like we're making some noise when whirling around her wobbling around you know that I think that's been taken into consideration that we would be hearing something that would be like the music of the earth just like you know you've heard when I played Saturn's right out and makes its music in it now has talks in selling this every once in a while\nBut uh yeah it could be that I I thought about that when you're thinking about the horns\nBut it but he's hired different do you think all these these homes are a little different than those horns\nWell let me tie and the other thought I had worked together okay I Know there's this idea of the electronic universe that fit electrical forces maybe have more of an influence\nOn the way things work and I'm not a at a much longer distance than we would think you know the gravity is not as as a and pressure or not the only\nUh you know the things that control how how things interact with each other and so you had you know you think of that sound that sounds like also like almost like a a\nLike a an electric a discharge or a a um you know something of being a energized electronically right and that could if we had an electronic universe\nThat could also explain some of those sounds where you have maybe there's a if something part of the earth gets charged up and then it has to discharge that\nEnergy is somehow ... um I I look at that is another possibility of course you'd have to accept the whole [laughter]\nYou know way to look at the way things interact with each other\nRight and then well there's always there's always the ionosphere heaters too that tend to abuse you have heart but you have other um you you have a right and they\nMaybe they understand that there is an electronic universe and that's why those things work or scratching our heads thinking how could they just beam up something you know when you only have pressure and gravity but if it is an electronic universe and they're not letting us know maybe that's why all that stuff works\nYeah now maybe I mean that's the thing is that you you you have to kind of think outside the box to wonder why we have all this stuff going on and I think that when I immediately when they said\nUh we we got to get a better way to identify what we're doing rather than just looking after a you know a overhearing phone calls between\nExtraterrestrials what they're doing they're looking for technical signatures left behind by the machinery and the technology and and so when we have these sounds that aren't necessarily that of communicating biological entities we do have sounds of what may be their synthetic life forms\nWe may have found that may be their machines and the robots and their spaceships that most of the time when these things happen what we're seeing as we're seeing probes we're not really seeing aliens we're seeing probes we're seeing robots we're seeing a these types of things uh you know observing earth from a distance\nI think we have what's happening is the future\nAnd the past are kind of coming together rediscovering that there was probably much more intelligent or you know ... civilization here at one point and then there are yes there are other [laughter]\nMaybe future beings maybe artificial intelligence was able to uh time travel\nAnd uh then we're in real trouble aren't we\nWell yeah I mean it's going back to the idea that what if this is just one big encyclopedia we have some sympathetic daily and just watching us every once in a while they rip a page out and that's where history kind of like ... pick up and start over again and again another uh another chapter in another verse you know\nAbout what do we get our head spinning too fast here we're gonna lose or any sort of court\nChart [laughter]\nDefinitely most definitely yeah ... that's the great thoughts I appreciate your calling thank you so much no problem that they could easily but to really six Seventy three thirty seven hundred extra believes except in three thirty seven hundred hey\nAh October or thirty first Halloween and then from there we have November Thanksgiving and they certainly with family and then of course Christmas\nIf you have family members are ground zero fans and you would like them to have like ground zero T shirts OR Books or something I Would tell you go to ground zero store dot org\nGround zero sorted out or you go there and we have a wide variety of different colored shirts ride variety of different colored pillows computer ah backpacks all kinds of things that the ground zero a logo on them it'd be great for someone in your family\nBelow ground zero and also you know you go to Amazon dot com type in my name my books are there you can get my books as well\nSo they make great gifts you can get them now why they're still inexpensive because I don't know how the mark up on Amazon and I know that if you go to the ground zero store ground zero store dot dot org\nThey are very kind to actually\nSlashed prices at first and then of course give you some great deals every once in a while you go to the store you get a great deal and a ground zero ...\nReally good right ground zero store dot org and its ground zero store dot org or go to Amazon dot com type and money by Louis pick up a book it just helps everything out thank you so much ... three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell I think that you know what we're seeing here is we're seeing a lot of things from oh elements in all of factions and we have a geo engineering happening we have a you know we have these discoveries are going on and they can't put their finger on what these discoveries are but they do say that there are strange\nThey say they have to reevaluate how they analyze and what they think of the phenomena that they're they're studying\nAnd so with that in mind we we're waiting for some sort of the answer but we're not getting the answers were looking for all\nI don't think ... I mean who's who's who's giving these are they're just trying to say they're trying to discover this I mean who is\nThey already have way they\nThey discovered things they've discovered things a\nBit of force them into changing the way they view the universe changing the way they view\nStories about alien abductions and aliens arriving they all these things are now being considered because uh they're thinking that we're looking at civilizations that may have advanced than than a gay guy we're looking at civilizations\nMaybe sending robots are way rather than a aliens are way or we have civilizations that are certainly a you know sending messages through a more um I guess you could say a microbial means we're we're getting microbes\nThat that don't respond like they're from earth we'd get neutrinos that ah don't respond like the the standard model here on earth these are things that are before science would never have you been considered but now it's it's something to think about\nOh if I ... I mean as far as that goes it's it's it's there's\nI mean right now we're in it in a transition of uh there's nothing that surprises me at this point right there so there's so much that's being kept on this for many many years I mean I'm even what's what got you know even I don't think many people realize but\nI'm a when tests that did pass away and they are the government could take some of their race is files unless of course mhm mhm uh\nWho was Trump's sunk all that to those files that result got John John Trump you\nKnow I thought that was and he said there was nothing there that was that interest as close to what I mean there's a lot of things and\nI think there was a lot of things in there I think that is a lot of things about it like plus older groups groups that are uh the go underground that are secretly creating\nTechnologies that we don't know about maybe have an underground a breakaway civilizations this type of thing so yeah I mean you know we're going all over with this but certainly or something to think about definitely something to think about let's go to Mike in Texas let's go to Mike Mike Hi you're on ground zero\nWrong time first time wanted that touch base on a little bigger picture than the local oh what a former shaving one poll transmitting another poll therefore what is it just a relay station the other planets another entities\nWell that would make sense because the sun always sends out a signal to the Europe Europe has to respond beard babysitting signals to under ... other planets the planet I mean this would be like you know when they say in the Bible that a certain God's would roar certain uh planets\nWould war they were roaring maybe it's because they were closer\nAnd the ... can be heard with the auto ear that they can hear the wars in the thunders communication between the planets planets communicate that's why we have such a a you know I think we're in a store but that's why we have such a you know uniform uh cosmos is because of the fact that we we have to have these planets in line\nSo that we use them for communications another and other things\nAnd so that's the thing that we could be one big transmitter\nThere can be one big transmitter this could be the answer is that we had been transmitting out to extraterrestrial intelligence for a long time and then extraterrestrial intelligence has been sending step back to us as well\nWhere we're listening but we're not hearing\nWell yeah it's because we don't know what we're hearing we don't know what we should be hearing for I mean I played the signals uh the diet that that it's been picked up on we just hear that his Homs we don't hear them as a perhaps a somebody it'd be intelligent we don't know that it's some hitting hitting message in there on the on the a particle ever the atomic level\nThat's up for the scientists to decide I Believe\nWhy don't we put things on both poles and listen and send our own\nI'm sure they do they have these uh these projects like ice cube and others that ah\nThey're trying to a ... a controller released trying to ah gather together the neutrinos to see what kind they are whether they are or what the standard model they go beyond the Santa Monica right now they're seeing everything going beyond the standard model and that's something that a either a\nIs a alien or be we're doing this to ourselves with CERN or I mean I can just go down the list\nOf all the reasons why the plan is doing what it's doing it's not good for one thing and could harm us it where it's not harm because you have do we know of but it could be the reason why we're seeing all this abrupt or climate situation we're seeing all this abrupt or earth a seismic stuff going on I mean\nThere's a lot of things that could explain this and that of course we have to also say that they're trailing other planets in the solar system that do have as was said earlier or an electrical universe effect on everything\nMaybe we're just not smart enough yet\nOr we\nMay not be but we are getting their uh and and we are reevaluating how we go about the uh the investigations which I think is interesting\nThat's all I got I keep listening\nYou might recall I really appreciate those good out to Jerry in Tennessee Hi Joe you're on ground zero eight ... hey what's up how you doing good\nJerry in Tennessee Hi Joe you're on ground zero\nThey collide hey what's up how you doing good finally get to talk to you man hallelujah well that's good to hear from you\n[laughter] hey I wanted to just ask you what about the have you heard of the five hundred and twenty eight hurts frequency\nWhen you read tune from four forty four hundred and forty four hurts you talked about Schumann rather than usual and everything else excuse me are you talking about Schumann residents are you talking about something else yeah is it there might be a connection there was ... what ... what you were talking about\nA well anything there's I'm sure that what they're picking up is ah being picked up and uh\nIt's being hurt beyond Ron felt beyond the Schumann residents and I heard that you know it fluctuates from time to time and no one can tell you why so or the background noise this is beyond the background noise it's got to go beyond the background noise in the background pulses otherwise they wouldn't be able to figure this out\nAnd be able to pick up on the particles too I think is a major issue they're able to pick up on this or are they called the decay the nuclear decay and they're seeing that it's not something the standard model it means something else is making it\nMhm I mean ... or ... command\nAvatar he's a allege us up late and I'm from the ladies he's had blond hair and blue eyes the blue eyes right\n[noise] [noise] I've I've heard I've heard of the ... I was there hunting and this guy showed up in the back of my children sit for an alien spaceship landed in front of my truck and the guy came out I mean it was added are in my truck\nAnd I said in the name of Jesus go in the end they disappeared in the name of Jesus go\nYes and he has done and then I went online and I happened to be researching something and I saw the picture vast are and that was the guy that I saw standing over the bit of my truck wow\nDid you and there was a broadcast in Nineteen Seventy seven over a couple of shows actually shows of England where ... spoke to people but he ... it wasn't ... real on a ... I'm In the broken yeah every good for you Jim Webb the weird\nThough is ice this I was I don't know if I was in my dreams state I was camping knows you're not and I was sleeping in the back of my truck and as this UFO landed in\nI don't know I I I thought I was in drilling but it was so real I mean I saw this blue blue suit the blonde hair blue eyes and then it was a couple of weeks later I was on line and I saw the picture of this guy I'd go Google it it's it's on there and the pitcher this blue eyes of the blue eyed played in guy\nWell maybe if I can find the avatar command message I'll play it over the radio it's pretty amazing it happened a dodge it out in back in Nineteen Seventy seven in November actually real on from Africa man just broke right in and started talking maybe um we'll talk about that coming up to really fix every three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\n[noise]\nMessaging ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to\nFit into your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more\nText prepare to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P.
