forty five not dated but the year was Nineteen forty five according to a picks TV a company that is a setting that out or putting forward they claim that the broadcast came from England\nThe broadcasters probably aired right after World War two at the early days the atomic age so disturbing part of the man's announcement\nIs where he talks about the erosion or dissolution of the right to privacy which of course now we have the smart cities moving it however cameras everywhere as he said he said that TV screens will be reduced down to you about the size of wristwatch is\nWell of course back then I'm sure they had Dick Tracy or or a several other science fiction type of things to look at and say yes but what they didn't plan on was that TV screens be reduced down to your phone and were you in your hand so it's kind of like that you know he was very close of course talking about Mars and the moon\nMetals that put on a he talked about many places to get entertainment\nOr he said the big companies are not a lot of big companies ... a lot of entertainment sources he's half right there I mean most of our mainstream entertainment it's coming from big companies own a a lot of a movie company they own a lot of a TV and radio conglomerates of magazines\nBut we also have a lot of independent entertainment and entered pending programming and writing such as what you\nHear on this program or what you see on the Internet that ah you know comes from just regular people reminded me when I'm at Timothy Leary\nUh back when he was doing his tours he told me he he felt as though the future would be a time where kids themselves would be making commercials on the computers uh that would be a high school project like they'd be making a he said well they'd be making commercials for Pepsi or they'd be making commercials for\nA Adidas or or some other company or where he said that this is how it would be done and of course now we see that a lot of these uh you know commercials are made with just south of a digital in fact some movies are shut on cell phones and a lot of independent films are done by younger people these days\nA lot of TV shows are done by younger people these days is they're producing these out of school\nAnd then they're getting big companies to buy them and produced so they go back and they do different edits and that sort of thing so that broadcast from Nineteen forty five has described in in more ways than one a perfect future I'll be ... I mean we have to wait and see what happens in twenty forty five\nBut he says a hundred years Nineteen forty five to twenty forty five what he believed was going to happen when he believe was going down and I just think it's fascinating to hear\nOnce again how something for the past seems to have a grasp on what is happening today or what would be happening in the future and twenty forty five so very interesting to go back and listen to that Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that strip elites except for three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to the fantastical concepts and most people considered the stuff of science fiction and while the idea that someone can Journey Through time and change the course of history\nHideous terrifyingly tantalize I mean it's simply just not thought to be possible\nBut what is it is\nAnd and what it what what is there had been does with insight that have been able to see the future of come from the future to let us all know through science fiction that that time travel is possible and that has happened from time to time or time after time\nSo it's very you know when I finished my radio show I stay up late I don't go to bed till about two or three in the morning and why because I I Want to go home kick off my shoes\nTurn on some mindless TV I watched in cartoons I watch you know Rick Morty much you know Family Guy although I've watched it a Family Guy now watching working more a more than watching Family Guy\nSo breaking Morty and and the reason why is because some are TV is relatively dull and I'm and I'm pretty much you know trying to\nYou know record something that can watch it another time but it's not really on TV that I'm watching the you know sometimes I go to Netflix and I watched that but I I I've been to watch when I'm watching Netflix\nSo I'm Glad that I have a subscription to Netflix I'm Glad that I have all these science fiction shows I can watch and you know I can watch my favorite science fiction shows whenever I Want to call for some reason\nOr the other night I was up late and I wanted to watch something\nSomething interesting so for some reason I saw the tomorrow in the film with George Clooney it's a Disney movie which I saw the theaters which I really like it was free and I said oh yeah well watch that'll be cool you know well there's a part of the film that I forgot even existed\nAnd that was a part they discussed a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history created for the film Gustave Eiffel met Jules Verne and Thomas Edison in\nHis tower apartment to start a secret society of optimists plus ultra was founded at the Eighteen eighty nine were ... world's fair in Paris, France and the organizations purpose was to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity\nKey members of plus ultra including Ray Bradbury million Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other key scientific pictures all this was also a member of plus ultra of course\nBut it's funny because nickel itself the Tesla new Mark Twain\nAh Nikola Tesla was a kind of a uh\nI'd say you know you it was kind of a one of H.

G. wells all of these people think of all\nTheir connections and how they did have connections because I mean tests that did work for and it's in one time he was friends with a Mark Twain Samuel Clemens of Ray Bradbury was uh\nIs what a Mark Twain Samuel Clemens um Bradbury was a visionary uh just go down the list H. G. wells was visionary all of these visionaries had some idea even Bradbury uh have you read the Martian chronicles or read the illustrated man\nYou'll see that they all have this vision of the future as them up had a vision of the future of Philip K Dick had a vision of the future all these guys part of plus ultra they were aware of aiding other dimension\nWhere they could go to actually um you know get away from it all that's the fictional part but the reality is that yes there was a secret society or secret group within Disneyland called the club thirty three\nIt was a there are VIPs or a allowed in there and other people not allowed in their show and you know that does the was part of the delays society a thirty third degree Scottish right free masonry duty was bad\nAnd so put all

Stanley Kubrick who's the director of two thousand what a space odyssey and described the end seemed to a filmmaker to what\nTwo thousand one of the space obviously was about about an old man it stayed in this very posh hotel and that he was about to take a leap into another realm of time listen to what he says to this uh filmmakers Japanese\nI that clip her ... her ... or ... or ... I'm Sorry I've traveled grows out of water you know for a book or a one that's about what it was a law\nThat old man or a ... a ... own style hot in the house for a couple of my\nHeart I Want her to find\nWhy now Ron\nOur her her her\nNon non right\nHour now right now on and on\nDriver from Herman how marathon\nIn our house right now I'm I'm Around my town ah honoring a run on a on a on a primary\nAnd what\nRight now no one point in her\nOut [noise] I haven't commented on how the world\nFrom non her run around a long\nNow\nTo only got one ... um\nKnow right now on on on that one on time\nSo what he's describing the ... how he transforms over time\nWaiting in a room it's kind of like a zoo\nBit the aliens or whatever they may be the God like entities of energy use it and created this to make him feel at home like a palace is it a palace and he's waiting for the years to pass and then he goes into another realm where he comes back to earth as sort of a Superman or a king or a leader\nOkay and so\nI I look at a parallel there of what he says is the mythology because I've read Joseph Campbell and he talks about the Mona mythical hero we've had many presidents over time including Brooke Obama\nWere they said that he was among the mythical heroes very strange about you know Obama's father not knowing much about his father kind of like Superman you know not knowing much about his father that kind of thing but with Donald Trump\nIt's like what do we know about his article what do we know about his father what do we know about his family what do we know about his relationship with Nikola Tesla what was it\nThat he found in those papers that were seized by that alien group or the government the FBI and why is it that he likes to stay in the U.S like what to talk about this\nPlace where plus ultra is all over the child\n[noise] and plus ultra is a fictional [noise]\nTime traveling secret society where H. G. wells Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison and Ray Bradbury and all of these visionaries were a part of it it makes you wonder doesn't live tomorrow land is truly a bit of predicted programming\nWe don't know for sure but you get your calls coming up Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA thinks every three thirty seven hundred will be back\nWith him and he [noise]\n[noise] All right what's one of the weirder concepts of Saudi around ... forty years ago the hole and the whole mid seventies\nTo my doctor strange [noise] a no man's thing being white man thing yeah what the mutants now a\nPatch of swamp outside a little town called set yourself Florida that was called an excess of reality it's a [noise] this is a multi personal play\nWell and yeah it is really weird and it's like we were saying earlier when everything went down with Trump people were protesting Trump's policies and he wasn't even president yet\nYou remember that yeah that was weird\nYeah they were all out there and when you go up to somebody and say well why are you protesting while we're protesting Trump's policies well he's not president yet I mean he got elected but nobody knew of his policies but yet they were protesting his policies before I even had a chance\nTo see what his policies were they were already saying what he was before he even did anything and that's why he thought was weird it was almost like they had the cart before the horse or the or the effect before the cars and now the cause of this happening\nThe effects are now echoing again and reverberating again and the protests the resistance is starting up again it's just like some echo in time\nI went back and forth and fall back to that you know that lock would novel about a there is such a roar in the streets of New York at the hotel on Fifth Avenue has a lot we have to guard the hotel on Fifth Avenue\nAnd you wrote your your throat and socialism I'm surprised you mentioned in a lot of cases are possible predict a program on there was a little more optimistic that they ever they'll let looking backwards and what's at Edward Bell and he's looking backward oh oh I mean a heck of a weird\nWeird yeah let me turn down the violence on if it\nWell I I I was just pointing out she was because he was a member of allegedly a member of plus ultra that's all ...\n[noise] but you know\nWhen you get points to adjust and I appreciate your calling it let's go to Steve in North Carolina Hi Stephen ground zero\n[noise] hey how ya doing first off let me say I'm a radio guy myself have been in business for Twenty years I Love your show you do a great job that he was so much I appreciate that and um but yeah H E mails I I always figured it'd be a time traveler in fact when the when he wrote\nA time machine back in the late Eighteen hundreds he describes a nuclear war\nBefore anyone could even imagine it I mean I mean the first time we had a a at a bar I wasn't in the forties and he describes it may be five you know\nI I find that interesting because he was talking about and in and of course things to come or where he was talking about a war that would break out in Nineteen forty\nAnd it would be an evil dictator that would run that more but wasn't until Nineteen forty one that this happened and of course Hitler was the was the guy and and also if you see the movie\nOr things become it's all about the power of the air or the power of the of the flying machines and how the flying machines will advance to a point where\nUh they would use them in warfare and there'd be a be Asian would be a concern in the uh the idea of space being a battlefield would be a concern\nRight ... it's amazing how how it came to be an and like I say that there was no way that you could just imagine that stuff in the late Eighteen hundreds he he had to be he had to see something\nYeah I mean he he was a visionary for sure but it all goes back to whether or not there is a\nPlus ultra group that actually existed but there were a visionary that were time travelers like Tesla\nAnd and do stuff I pull and all these people are over time and Ray Bradbury and ... and all these guys whether or not they were involved\nAnd what not they did go to some other place where they were able to skate this world and maybe tests flu is one of the guys that made this possible and John gene Trump was one of the guys who knew about it as well and maybe even Donald Trump knows about it too\nYeah they like I say you're you're you're blowing my mind that I [laughter] it's just amazing how this all comes together I something has to fit you know\nSomething something's off I mean what got me though is I accidentally stumbled upon the mar a Lago tidbit because I was thinking to myself you know there's gotta be something more to this and when I saw plus ultra on the tiles at mar a Lago I thought wow this is this is too much\nRight [laughter] yeah it's crazy man or either\nRight Steve thank you for calling the showed and I appreciate it faced by the way it's going to Pete in Texas Hi Peter on ground zero\nHey Clyde hey so quickly a lot of trying to burst ... bubbles hair a logical type site person but I don't doubt or the law that\nThat's his secret societies to ... could actually exist neither like uh the the deep state that happens a lot into a political conversations in but could they have\nAlready were Lago where you have a the plus also on these tiles could not just be I I don't want to say coincidence but more so a coincidence that if Donald Trump was aware of his uncle and understanding the formation of his uncle had\nSure it's all it's all it's all a coincidence of course it can be all coincidence but you don't look when you're looking at coincidences and you can name three four five six coincidences it seems a little bit weird when you have the pattern going on\nThree four five six coincidences it seems a little bit weird when you have the pattern going on and and while what lock would wrote they have nothing to do with plus ultra it just certainly all seems a bit I mean most of it's all based on fiction every writings in literature okay\nWe'll get to Marilyn it's a movie that talks about plus ultra as a secret society we have a lock would writing what he wrote about with regard to Baron Trump in the last president\nWe've got all these things that are kind of secret is really sick or an ethically ah mesh together they come together in such a way it's beautiful and it's synchronous Dick and yeah it could be all of one big coincidence but boy it's one hell of a coincidence isn't it\n[laughter] it is a hell of a coincidence or just like it so I Love the people that ... all the time it's just not one to the level of uh one of the cool visual and it just all over the storyline and it just seemed to be picked up in the mood here or a book here\nI can tell you that Laura law go at it had been built long before plus soldiers showed up in in a film by Disney\nYou realize that it\nWill show is attached to John ... and then you still have a the the the\nIt was so that was ... film was John ... a member of plus ultra\nI couldn't tell you you guys know a\n... plus ultra real secret society or is this something that was just made up and it's just coincidental that plus ultra happens to be plastered all over mar a Lago\n\n... and and I I Would I Would say that it ... right but at the same time it's people probably just putting the pieces all to do with what they know how long do with the tiles placed in la la though ... long before the movie\nWill sure I'm sure it was on the movie came out last year or two ago I mean our law go just a few years ago\nYeah I mean so I mean mar a Lago laughing but along being around a lot longer than that that was like Trump second home before he became president so you know that that's something that ah it's just odd that the king as they call him and then a pilot or palatial area where\nIt's kind of like what Cooper talked about an old man is in an area that's got all of this beautiful nice and neat stuff where he's like you to do and then he's with the way by these guys came to tease and then he sent back to earth to become Superman\n[noise]\nI mean covert knew a lot about secret society we knew a lot about what was going on behind the scenes I mean eyes wide shut perfect example in the film we did that was basically revealing a lot of stuff in the background\nStuff but I just I just figured I'd I'd I pitch and thought this is even more how how the the logical online and then you mentioned it earlier someone's income in Taiwan or a short book um but I I think that's an amazing\nYeah yeah they could just as\nIf they could but you know even when I went to ... they I Know even though I don't like the ... so he said well fact check this snow I did and they said it's partially true I don't know I don't know what part is\nPartially true [noise] I don't know if I Believe ... three thirty seven hundred will be back what do you think [laughter] go away [laughter]\n[noise]\nWhat happened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems like you're constantly
