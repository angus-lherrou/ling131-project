hearing from further junk writer in the in the last hour or give me the information\nTo basically taking back as Rob was silent separate sixty years Steven giving a speech the uh uh I guess you could call describes account which is amazing some of the stuff that you've sent and all the things I I read or just passing up here's a question that ah I I mean\nJust something I Want you clarify for me and a lot of people don't notice so when these things started happening Roland or are um a number of his aunts and uncles in some priests were aware of this they were before the X. ray says that might be to a Lutheran ministers slept with the boy they\nSlept in his bedroom to try and figure out what was going on and then\nUh there were a Catholic ... a non Catholic aunt and uncle bunch\nOf relatives who were present and they made a makeshift refugee board am I getting this correctly where they put a plate on a table and it moved from letter to letter to explain who the demon or what the demon whether that true\n\nBased on the information that I found in that document they don't they don't really reference that specifically a so I've heard\nI've heard different accounts that yes there there was you know that the ants ... enjoyed using that we'd be bored I'm you know as an oracle and um but in the document and the PDF that's referenced I'm I'm not aware and there wasn't any reference from what I've seen to the actual use of the ... and\nIt was it a week or per se they were actually this is what I read from the the documents that they actually use quote un alphabetical medium on porcelain kitchen table letters of the alphabet were written on paper were underlined would ever the table moved or wherever the plate moved on the table\nAnd a quarter of ... became evidence is similar to what was done except without the Christmas lights on stranger things actually\nUh and the phenomena indicated that it wasn't the devil now\nThis said that it was the soul of the disease and then there's it's it's redacted who do they figure out what was it was the spirit was possessing the boy\nYes and and you mentioned that there was some documentation and they did right the the letters\nDown as well when I misunderstood you know about the instead of the wage\nOh it is it's kind of a makeshift we did or that's what I said ... ...\nYeah yeah and um so I think they suspected because they were trying to I I think they were really hoping that it would be the ants\nAnd then you know essentially from you know conduct in you know asking questions they did receive confirmation that yes it was the ant but they were being deceived um\nAnd um you know ultimately it was the dean and and and that there are references to the the devil\nItself as well you know as you get further into the document\nSo again this is like in the movie The Exorcist ... were first\nA father carrots or his mother was ah in the body of Reagan and remember de me don't do this to be deemed me\nOr the other spirits were speaking him he says you're not my mother you're not in there with my mother this is all a deception so probably that's where they got the idea that uh what was going on is that they probably thought the aunt was in it with possessing the child\nAnd then eventually they were deceived and found that it truly was a demon that was possessing the child\nYeah yes and um and then they were\nUm and the father does a really great job of a documentary and um they the messages that were initially you know from recording you know given the background with respect to what the family recorded but then a ...\nYear that you're on a farm in the ... and even actually um preceding their their travels to St Louis um they felt\nThey were noticing that there were you know red marks and and riding appearing on his skin on and um one one of the the word was Louis so they felt that that\nYou know that they would eventually we're supposed to go they started the signed and actually that's what they should go to St Louis and um and then contact the Jesuit order and and the priest stare for help though I'm so it\nIt's you know very deceptive and um you know and then as as it progresses I you know the\nThe word gets sinister and and I'm more and more evil and and even there's a lot of as you start we acted right out messages while they were just two styles have yet to them to share\nThey couldn't share them because apparently from what I was reading\nAnd like your your excellently pointing out a and sort of ... brother Grider he said the words were spoken by this young boy were so foul I Will not repeat them\nAnd there were plenty of followers were expressed in the movie The Exorcist of course a that's a film that was considered one of the\nMore terrifying horror movies of our day based on the story of Berlin do Nineteen forty nine point we're talking about the ruling do story with Stephen Smith dinner and ground zero questions we'd like to add to the comments were added to the show tonight where you get to the phones coming up on a Tripoli except for three thirty seven hundred\n... during the dirty laundry yeah go ahead you're German grassy I just you know just the the writing on\nThe skin and again and one important point is you know some may suspect a while the um [noise] you know that maybe I'm the child had had written and you know as as a Ruth I'm by the witnesses again the family where there there were ... priests there and they would appear without and being anywhere near\nA you know touching a part of his body and also um there were they were on the parts of the body that could possibly touch\nYou know this guy in Prince from what I understand it is and I don't want to get to grab it but I guess you know we're on late night radio and if you listen to this program so far you know we're dealing with we're dealing with demons we're dealing with how they were they racking tear up the human body and how most of the police were involved here aged quite a bit when they were working on this\nAnd trying to get this boy back to normal one of the things I've heard as it was so bad they had to\nBasically hog tied him to the bad and and they had to keep him from ... and the problem was that the the demon whatever it was would spell on his body things like a dabble in hell and a lot of sacrilegious\nReferences to Jesus Christ\nAnd at the time they were done the priest would say we command Christ with Christ command you or we command the devil demon name you named yourself and leave the body of the boy and every time\nThe demon would speak to them in Latin and then with the move to what I mean and and you know we're lucky you always saw ... soup and The Exorcist before and I understand that the boy would definitely Kate and urinate\nOver the priest and he was he wasn't you know taking a a you know regular like\nProjectiles what it was so you know they they eliminated the gross is of that\nAnd and replaced it with vomiting or in the movie but the truth was the other the demon would literally said to them that are you there he's going to leave the body of the boy and Everytime he did it the boy what do you earn eight or are you a decade on the ... and so they were covered in in in all of that while they were doing the extras as\nWell and if you don't mind that I share quickly or just from the from the journal oh and first of all I I Do want to clarify that\nThe um ... veil on line and um so uh it's open it's you know they love of the public and I will share I Can't say that you know it's it's my you know my document or to get out um or any of that means so right\nYou know from my standpoint I certainly you know\nPlease to share it but again I\nHave my library that we are developing a library of of of files and we're going to end now people why we're developing a library of files and I just want to make sure that I could use that as they put the link in our library of files so people can do the research if they wish to until I was asking\nOh it certainly certainly and then and you know from my standpoint yes most definitely but I just wanted to clarify that and if you don't mind reading quickly just from that the journalist says the most distinct markings on the body with a picture of the devil on ours right leg and the word hell imprinted on our chest and such a way that our\nCould look down upon his shut the read the letters plainly so it was horrific for\nYou know for for Roland is experiencing this but if I can just quickly add it just said that um there were also you know the arrows pointing down towards you know his his nail part in it and they said that\nThey feel that I'm\nIn further answers to the prayer because they would you know constantly prayer there were two letters go and the third\nPointed away from the crotch an indication that might have meant that the devil that leave by way of urine nation or ... though it just shows you know the level of foreign and um [noise] and uh that you know this poor boy you know\nUnder went and then also the core family that's that's you know ... at this point in time I don't believe they were there they were already in the um they waste from the house\nWho actually at the college church um there was a referee on campus so that fails university campus they actually did perform so that part of the ex over there as well though I mean that's a little known fact but\nOut here is another thing\nA John brighter had said that one of the things was most terrifying was him constantly sounding like woody woodpecker he would click his tongue and he would laugh like woody woodpeckers so we'd go [laughter] any laugh like that and it was so bizarre because they said it was perfect\nIt sounded like it was a it was it was a just say panic a woody woodpeckers laughter but what was interesting is is that\nThere was a time where ah ah he doubled over a and they woke up crying and he says\nMy throat hurts my throat hurts and they and they you know when you do for the boy and then as soon as he said my throat hurts\nAll of a sudden his voice cleared and they heard him sing or harm or la la la ... the blue Dan you and and then of course he's saying the old rugged cross and I even I even heard from um ... someone else um so\nI I think it was actually mark telling me that he also saying\nAh they also say that some old man river and what was funny is that he was performing these songs and\nAnd as he performed them the priest felt like oh well obviously you know nothing evil could do this you know they're they're getting closer closer closer\nAnd then as soon as um as soon as they got closer to the see the boy was okay it happened to get the boy would\nCloser to ... see the boy was okay it happened again the boy would you know release everything out to them\nAnd and and he would say to them you know in Latin some horrible thing about the ... about the priest or father you didn't bother you know and so all the stuff we saw the movie The Exorcist was nothing compared to what was going on with that boy you know it's pretty\nWell yes and actually he broke father Halloran knows and its reference and the PDF and um so they are many any hit another um another father that was there I'm In the nose law and cause it to bleeding severely but he actually broke\nFather Halloran snow sane and he's he's the\nI I feel more connected even though I never really had an official relationship with him or anything never really knew him but you know just seeing them around campus and just knowing you know just knowing you know seen them interact you know a couple of times that I did I just a very serious man and and um\nAgain just really horrific but he didn't really talked about it but just to know that that was documented in there and um\nThen the other thing if I may add quickly that I Do want to share um during my time of the archives um there was a um protested that would come in and they had a a\nAn old middle age a manuscript collection so you know they they collected so the a professor we're going to the archives and do his research while he he knew father Halloran quite well and um he shared a story that there that\nThere was always a sense of dread and foreboding when he would uh prepare to go to the election brother's hospital to assist father about Ernie\nAnd um it was just that I live in a negative like forest or energy that you know just a feeling of dread one time he gets that back in that that time they had street cars and he took the streetcar named it to the election brother's hospital stopped and was about to exit the streetcar when he put his foot from the streetcar down\nTo that set foot on the ground a fourth stop him it stopped in the air and he could not\nHe could not placed a down so and he said a prayer and then it released and he was able to you know put it down planets foot and just go carry on you know it's just going in the act just as I'm but that was you know that's not first came from father Halloween but it was from a very trusted source that you know\nThat I got a new during my time there and and I trust him to leave the honest\nHonest people and um you know again it was just a story that I was always fascinated me and I'm just pleased to be able to share it\nWant to read an excerpt from is we'll go to the phones ... at midnight the father's planning to give rolling holy communion but Satan would have no part of it even while the institution of the buses second one was explained to roll in his body was badly scratched in branded the word hell was printed on his chest and thigh\nUpon the explanation or the apostles becoming priest receiving our lord of the last supper scratches appeared on ruins hips to his ankles and heavy lines seemingly the protests and the holy communion\nWhen father voter and attempted to give roll into small particles of sacred host the boy was taken up by a quick seizure the devil said that he would not allow ruined to receive after four or five attempts it was thought that he spiritual communion wouldn't have known as a surprise or it would have to survive\nBut even the expression of the words I Want to receive you and holy communion was cut off by a seizure the word communion Ramon further indications during the evening it seemed to be attempt to administer the sack would have Eucharist\nRouse the devil more than ordinarily he went through is huge routine of fighting barking like a dog cursing speeding\nAnd of course everything else but he kept on longer than usual there was no quiet sleep or nothing uh but constant prayer for the child and it continued through the night I mean this\nThis is how tiring and how brutal this actresses was in Nineteen forty nine [noise]\nAnd they just yes just that they did they attempted and they tried for several days to administer the Eucharist her communion and and um they just they unsuccessful and again just as you said he'd gone to transfer and I do recollect also the you know how you know\nPhysically exhausting you know that you say they were just holding them down and just from battling that their muscles eight\nAnd um you know and it's just yeah it it just really was not what was that wasn't only spiritual side but it was physical I mean you have broken noses
