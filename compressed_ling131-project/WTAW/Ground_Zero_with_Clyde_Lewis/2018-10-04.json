mostly ... comet travel you huge speeds dude with George and beyond our solar system somewhere interstellar space but\nHere's the thing that's interesting about the more and more\nRama scientists did not stop\nThis show called alien spaceship in fact\nCity investigators Jill Tarter ... shows that\nThey were conducting a study investigating whether they're any radio signals being\nThey were conducting a study\nInvestigating whether they're any radio signals being emitted from a mom or however here's what's interesting\nWas notified that scientists were following this craft\nAnd the rumor has it that this ... been came close to being a disclosure event and why is that well because it just seemed to everything was falling into play a more and more was the closest thing we've got to disclosure\nThis is what the these are new finding these things I was reading it in science and science daily\nBut more and more rama they were gonna call around but they go to a ... long been or that

was called by the national Academy of sciences committee on astrobiology science strategy for the surge of life in the universe the meeting was held at the University of California Irvine\nVisits citing prompted a meeting\nThis all of this prompted a meeting okay and it was this meeting it was it was worth Jill Tarter\nThe woman who was interested in a more and more and it and it's moving through space she's one of the world's best known leaders in Mr ... soldiers\nShe stated that Saturday\nThe search for extraterrestrial intelligence should change its name\nAnd and what tiger said she she explained that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence generates an incorrect perception of what scientists in this field of study we're actually doing she said a more appropriate title for the fields she said would be the search for techno signatures\nOr signs of technology created by intelligent alien civilizations not to me it has been secretly these scientists you scan straight through space eagles Russian dressing civilizations may have stumbled upon something that may be a signal from an extraterrestrial technology rather than direct conversations between biological entity\n... or send a signal or more and more was an alien spacecraft they didn't tell us\nBut it was good enough to prompt meetings was enough to get President Trump to consider the space worse it was enough to release the information about the threat assessment of UFOs\nThat one little citing I'll be as big one hundred foot long [noise] whatever it was scientists will say it was a comet [noise]\nSome scientists say the comment but now those who are searching for signals in space said that something [noise] something is prompting us to have to rethink everything we thought we knew about the possibility of aliens and how we communicate with them or if we even try to communicate with them [noise]\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's your belief except for three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis was ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nWe go back to Jill Tarter\nWho decided that it was time to organize scientists get together\nAt a meeting was called by the national Academy of sciences committee on after ... astrobiology science strategy for the surge of life in the universe\nAnd that's where they did they they uh\nAt the University of California Irvine is at this meeting that Jill Tarter who's after physicist she got many years with study many years with NASA got together and said guys you know the search for extraterrestrial intelligence named we'd given to our our group of people studying the cosmos it needs to be changed\nCharter explains afraid search for extraterrestrial intelligence generates an incorrect perception of what the scientists and it's real they're doing\nThey're not searching for\nExtraterrestrial extra terrestrial intelligence they're merely searching for techno signatures\nSignatures up extra terrestrial technology and to me you\nWhich means to me it secretly these scientists you scan space for space singles from extraterrestrial civilizations may have stumbled on to something\nThey may have a signal\nTechno signature\nFrom extraterrestrial technology\nAnd it has something to do with the more and more or rama\nEavesdropping on a conversation between alien civilizations would be fascinating but detecting an alien signal with a technological fix for the technological signature may be forthcoming this may be the thing they're going to tell us but there would have to be a staff put in place\nThat would be capable of of interpreting the signal and its signature\nInterpreting the signal and its signature\nSo if a technological signal was detected who would be there to detect are learned the nuances of what the signal means well here's your answer this week\nIs hosting a conference\nAnd guess what they're going to do they are hosting a conference dedicating and rethinking\nNASA wants scientists to evaluate how far the search for techno signatures has come and what the most promising possibilities are for future future use and future study and perhaps even disclosure\nYou heard me they are meeting together\nAnd they're having a conference dedicated to rethinking the quest NASA one scientist to evaluate how far the search for techno signatures has come and what the most promising possibilities are for the future\nPresentations will include discussions of different types on techno signatures\nHow different types of technology can pick them up and what other developments like the rise of big data offered to the field of searching the cosmos for after terrestrial technology or check those signatures\nWorkshop includes many speakers who have been leading the search for extraterrestrial intelligence for decades so while we have not received confirmed reports of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence one would assume that something or some civilization may have sent a techno signature several signatures\nYou can also be assumed that perhaps a more and more\nDid send a techno signature\nAnd that this anomaly is being assessed for possible direct hit by being by directed meaning a direct it they had a direct communication\nYou know there are other things that contribute to the possibility I I don't know last year for the last ... no one last year as\nBeing June we were reporting here on ground zero there was something that happened with him more and more then again had scientists rethinking their decisions to it and that was a an international science team was analyzing a space based observations of a more and more and then they were tracking it and they found something strange its arc\nArc of the of the movement of the object couldn't certainly be explained by the effect of gravity that would be pushing it you know the sun would be pushing on it because it's a it's a comment right\nSo the object appeared to accelerate on its own\nIt was reported in some circles or the anomaly accelerated again and again and again\nThe celebration of the object was not caused by commentary out gassing\nWhen the object moved to the Jovi insist them Saturn\nA Jupiter\nAccelerate as if it was intelligently piloted in in ... in another four years are saying that it will pass them tunes orbit on its way back to interstellar space\nSo now you know the secret now you know what's going on\nNow you know what triggered the idea for the space force now you know why\nThey're rethinking their position on aliens being the aliens weird experience being biological but they are\nAnd that they're no longer looking for extraterrestrial intelligence they're looking for extraterrestrial techno signatures made by extraterrestrial intelligence\nGo to Paul in Kentucky Hi Paul you're on ground zero\nIn ... show as usual thank you\nAnd it was just talking about the the wall of technology oh can you know a scientist speculate to reach a certain level of technology and further uh today I was reading a science a guide dot org and talking about Anita the aerial or\nI Can't remember the spelling of it but it's a\nIt's a satellite that goes over the Antarctic poll not old and it registered new particles notions of fourth time still fly over for now\nAre you talking about the the discovery they made about uh gosh they said that something is transmitting out of Antarctica it's some sort of a particle that goes uh that that they say it's come through the planet outside the end of Antarctica and\nI guess yeah yes and they could change physics as we know\nIt's called the ... it's going to be a or we think it's called the Antarctic impulse transit in Santa\nYes sir Yes sir Anita ... and it can change\nPhysics as we know according to the scientist because there's this new types of particles yeah it's not a brand new particle but it's a particle acting in a way that it shouldn't be which is what they're confused about what I understand the article\nThis is a ever had in talking about the wall right I mean how many are all let me site what you were talking about is in Scientific American right your readings and Scientific American Yes sir okay ah this is what it says quickly and we'll have to go to break\nTheir something mysterious coming up from the frozen ground in an article and it would break the laws of physics as we know physicists don't know what it is exactly\nWhat they do know it's some sort of Cosby gray a high energy particle that blasted its way through space into earth and then back out again for the particle physicist know about the collection of particles that make up what the science called the standard model of particle physics shouldn't be able to do that\n\nOkay so what's going on here shouldn't be going on yes\nThere's some sort of a particle beam or a number of particles unknown to earth going into the earth and coming out the end of Antarctica going out into space again\nYeah blasting out according to the article so this means that whatever is going on\nI Will have to crash into something out there are at least hit something and say hello to something or you know re meet wall to wall meat ray of\nA meat spacecraft door that's that's what they're saying with this right that's what I'm getting that\nYeah so that's a firm that also yeah God what an amazing thing to bring up that I fall thank you so much I'm Glad you're reading meant you fit into the market and you're getting that information that's great great story there's a link you so much God what a great great call\nYeah can you imagine that there is some sort of a [noise] an unknown particle beams going from one end of the earth out to the other side and it's supposed to go out into space and it's going out and no one knows where it's headed [noise]\nBut it's going to hit something right so what is this thing is that traveling through the earth out the other end and it's trying to pick up on something some sort of transmission remember when sat and tried to communicate with the moon\nAnd we didn't know what it was it was amazing to hear the communication\nFor now the earth is doing it was something else in science you did not know what this is it's not supposed to be happening [noise]\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA thinks there three

Howard said many times you said\nAnd I think she did this when we were interviewing her a I had to go back and review that interview we did an interview with her when we were in ...\nAnd she interviewed over Skype with us she wasn't there but she wanted to go on the show when we were there and she was bringing up a these these thinking robots and these alien technological marvels and she was saying something that affects you were saying that\nThe biggest concern the aliens have we're the biggest interest the ailing raise have is an interest in our consciousness they don't have ...\nI wanted a piece that in our soul\nYeah basically are so that they have an advanced in our souls ratings are born\nIn space they have no soul right are they interested at us 'cause we have an all white and salt\nRight and they're wondering how is it you know they're wondering what was this some synthetic technology was created by an intelligence far greater than us you know can you imagine Bailey and saying that about us saying wow you know you know we're we're that we're actually that that ... what's that\nThey're they're a creation of the garden to write God's word but you know you were talking earlier about cargo cults and stuff right as far as I'm concerned the cargo calls on this planet go back\nSix eight thousand years because our religion today are based on what was left after the God left this world right\nBut see we have to get us now thinking about this we go back to the ancient religious they ran amok religions and they had technologies most of the arc of the cabinet that was the technology right\nDo back even before the Abraham religion she has a scenario and you had that the Vatican\nLine is I mean remember laws do walk a ... in South Carolina's remember\nWhat Oppenheimer said about the atomic bomb he says this was the first atomic bomb that was made in modern times he says\nThat phrase I always found that amazing that either aging houses that eight thousand years ago were writing a vet a tax six eight thousand years ago and they didn't write poems about birds they wrote flowers\n[laughter] I Love you Bob God what a great golf take\nYou there in history for the ... the star wars Bob thinking somebody died for gray called thank you so much it yeah it's true I mean think about what often I ever said when they look or that when they blew the bomber okay and think about the atomic aliens that we talked about a few days ago back on friday\nI was reading a long time ago you know what do the aliens have become your what do they want for us but they don't they don't want 'em [noise] they don't want to some of the of the building blocks for live because they can be found all over the universe is\nThe only thing they could think of would be a two things water and Cora Phil 'cause cornfield I think is unique to planet earth and water when they can get water anywhere usually in space we have probably the purest form where the foreign they need for either fuel for sustenance for some reason they need water\nWith the other one would be either they look to us for the justice meaning the aliens come here to beat us or they're here to examine us and they're here to look a silver because we have things that they don't have and they're wondering how we've been made\nAnd they also feel the same way about some animals that's why they you know the alleged Cato mutilation ideas they they they see us in the experiment on us and in some cases they have mutilated people or are they have taken him in harmed them\nInsane with animals I and you know it's not just how the mutilated horses and beer\nSheep other animals get mutilated the same way cows do so we have experiments going on with these creatures because they don't understand how were made and why we work\nThey know what a brain is being with a computer brain is they know how a synthetic bodies operate but whoever's programmed them had this as a keen interest is why we exist\nAnd they don't know why we exist\nBut what I can see where were you derive that from because that's what we do to lower forms of life right we either a lower life forms or we experiment\nOr maybe they don't see us is lower life forms they see and says some higher unattainable life for them and they want to take it apart to see how it works\nWell I mean look all that as possible but I I think we we have to assigned\nTo the concept of God what level of intelligence is God is God's spiritual since day or biological and I'm just saying that it may not always be the case that biological create synthetic\nWhether it be okay what are you guys biological plus meaning that if you use biological or if she's biological\nThen what we have is a limited God or we have a group of them died and they were just the remnants of there's a a a they're a creation that they created us they died and now we're here to take the stewardship\nAnd many people who are afraid to say well we can't play God that's the point we should because that's why they created that they created us to grow in nature and they are they created to grow in intellectually\nAnd that way they would basically leave us to do what other civilizations have done in the past and that is grow and then of course they get to a certain ah ... you know they get they get to a certain level where they can't go any further they either die off or they then branch out into space\nSo how do you handle the argument which came first the chicken or the egg\nI've heard it's the chicken but then again I don't know\nThe I Would say it's they both happened at the same time and uh because it's a creation and but then you go back to the the age old question of who created\nGod and so therefore\nYou could say it would be whether you say God as biological or or God is spiritual intelligence or synthetic intelligence you always run into that argument\nBut why do you also write biology by biology and our sense would be limited would it not\nYes way\nThere would be less limits on\nSynthetic technology there would be less limits on synthetic technology am I correct\nYes and and and but then I Would say after that there there would be even less limits on spiritual intelligence if you want to recognize spiritual intelligence\nBut that is something that they're doing with ... thinking about that for a moment they want to know if everything and I guess I can use the parlance every ... they're wondering if everything has got in it but I mean by that it does everything have a consciousness is everything you have a spirituality to it or does everything have\nAh some sense of being\nThat say and so that's exactly where I'm going because in order to determine that does everything have God in it you first have to determine what God did God biological synthetic or spiritual wow so I'll leave it at that\nWell and then of course I think that's going to be the big question and future used to be you know where did we come from why are we hearing we're we're going now it's what God do we have been watching it over or is it a biological God is a synthetic God or is it a spiritual God\nAnd it'd be spiritual than all the power to this guy has ruined everything in the planet everything in the universe and it's a man's man's intelligence that covers the entire brain and the various dimensions become permanent brain\nYes ... and I think it is the most easily explain that God has a spiritual intelligence\nBecause that would explain that God is everywhere that it's not going to have the same limit as biological and synthetic which is limited to the\n... you know travel and transport in the body if your spiritual on television you don't have a physical form to transport so you know be everywhere at every time\nSo once again being the attainment of spiritual being comes after death be payment of of what you do with that\nSpiritual being comes after death beat payment of of what you do with that spiritual being after death either determine whether or not you're going to go elsewhere what's that\nIsn't that what we mean by a soul isn't that in fact uh our spiritual intelligence it because it's something that that doesn't really have a solid form\nWell the way it goes with quantum immortality and we talked about going to be more ... before have we not yet but at the age some sort of transmission of some sort of broadcast it only our machinery\nOr whatever it may be organic or whatever we want to call it may be some form of synthetic intelligence is picking up on that signal and when that with our bodies breakdown that signal gets taken from that body and goes elsewhere and transmit elsewhere\nSo whenever you have to solve for example complex math problem you first have to define the terms so that's what I wanted to do to like\nGo jak thank you it it it it basically makes the discussion even more fascinating thank you so much right by you know\nIn a yeah that that that uh once again a brings up a some very valid points about you know we have the hallmark card version of God\nAnd you can and I I don't mean that insulting way what I mean is that we have had God simplified for us in the Bible\nSo all we know is God but due to basically determined\nThat type of God\nHe she or it is it would be either biological synthetic\nIf consciousness is the most valuable thing in the University of ... what the synthetic intelligence with the techno signatures want from earth\nThen obviously\nThis is what he's been by being made in the image of God\nGod's consciousness that we have the God consciousness and each and every one of its in that we are potentially use it\nAnd not use them all the time for bad things\nIn abusing that ability is when we commit acts where people die and suffer in ...\nWhen we have the ability to do great things in one of the things\nWe're often told that we're not supposed to opening up the door for more widened and immense perception of what the future can be and what it could be if we just apply ourselves to a more cosmic idea of where we're going [noise]\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's Tripoli six have been three thirty
