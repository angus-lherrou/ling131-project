just contribute to the the whole problem with this country now and that is we're against that were against it were against it what are you for I don't know but I'm against it John\nCarmen with us tonight on ground zero former Secret Service and talking about the bombs\nThat were sent out today um you know these are pretty strange bombs especially when you know you'd you'd figure a bit of this was a a you know this is going to be some ... some sort of successful endeavor\nThat one would go off but none of them went up I don't think any of them were a program to go off so what would you say that this is a bit of added prop\nYeah I mean a friend of mine was just reminded me too long ago a false flag I mean you use false flag almost\nEvery show almost I mean it's it's called the terminology but I mean my training goes back to eat in Quantico, Virginia Secret Service things down there to a Marine Corps a mature person strike team member San Diego with US Customs laws\nSo I've seen and then exposed to all the various types even in basic training and Secret Service or Washington DC\nBuilders incidents if they had like a some famous says\nWashington DC so that there is a incidence if they had like a some famous says it's happened back in Michigan years ago back in the sixties so they use the old\nFashioned stuff you know pipe bombs are oh that's not the technology that's all this stuff they use nowadays I think I made reference to you and all of a an email message or something about the movie the body of lies with lower DiCaprio ...\nAnd it was a CIA agent in the middle east and it's really interesting if you follow the movie but I've seen it so many times I go what am I watched as two nights ago were psychic right so it's like\nThey're using cell phones to set up for a designated bombs which are high tech stuff just like I ... in the middle east is pipe bombs anymore that stuff is like old hat I mean it's like they're they're just saying yeah they're just trying to show you they can do it now has said well\nHere's here's a question how they're able to flag a certain packages being a suspicious I mean what are some of the butter seizures and criteria that you're supposed to analyze well where you have to go through\nI'll I'll give you an example I used to work at the White House that one of the gated areas and when the CIA career came in with a leather briefcase that knows that seventies it came in with a um a daily brief and I took it an X. rated I looked in through the X ray machine\nAnd I could use the love to go all the way through it all the way back she paid for like a single paper flip a little clip\nThat's one way so they don't even get stuff that goes straight to the White House she goes to a designated post office or a male facility so they process stuff like that if it comes at a package it's like that and he was a pipe bomb and players or she might or\nDevices is going to be heavy it's going to get an X ray that's the first designated then they can use a slide to sniff it there's another machine that they use to sniff for powders nitroglycerine\nUh all kinds of other explosives ah syntax and it's another key words I won't use so that they can sniff it out those are high tech okay so they can ... if you said medic extras they can use other types of machines and as a ... or ... watches\nSo that there's a way to stand it if it's too bulky too big they are going to open it for their going to look at possibly often I've discovered packages for that said the British embassy in Washington DC to in the morning\nThey had to come out or the is the typical security explosive ordinance day would come up and they were sort of affordable X ray and if it's really a doubt they'll take it carefully with a bomb a person\nWho's properly dressed they'll put it in a special thing and they'll we'll it off with the U.S army or something and exploded somewhere\nSee what I find interesting is that you were talking about the rudimentary nature of these bombs being sent out\nAnd that it kind of makes me wonder about that ah when what was it just a few weeks ago Venezuela or their leadership or someone tried to assassinate their leader and he tried to do it with a drone or just a flying drones they were going to use it to to kill the area\nAnd I think there are plenty of other ways but then see that's why these pipe bombs I think are affected because they're there to scare they weren't there to kill their their to scare and there are there in my opinion a to a you know pork or at least change\nThe views of elections in political moves which is no different than when the uh uh the the ... one rushed me she's in Oregon\nPut salmonella in salad bars to make people sick so they wouldn't go out and vote\nThis is the same thing they did with before cabin on with the rice in the the the and they get older the vote there to give it seems to be there to be distracted and it also happened now would be just before the vote happening in November\n... did you get a look at the uh website I sent you was twenty four hours to none of us weapons yeah bandleader autonomous weapons that are located yeah three\nRats three grams or something like syntax I'll just use as a possible and and then they throw them in their thousands of them even just one and they had one that was a a different type ... by the White House\nMonths and months ago and\nThat's that's a violation of the air space over there but that's a separate discussion kind of\nRice and safety technology which means that they target you and it's got recognition on it they can take your picture off the Internet and they could let it go in there and if you're in the area it'll zoom in and it'll attach itself or shoes that thing where the\nMoney for a Senate forget it they just take an autonomous drone they said that your way and then bam you're gone\nAnd they said that you know that they will say you know that's our jak protests as they say things quite small force and they start getting up than\nProbably going to be around here twenty twenty or so when all that so that's where I started to hit the ... and um you know you in are so many other people like ah like ... went and bought it\nYou in are so many other people like uh like Rush Limbaugh and Jones and all them recovering the rice and stuff and you didn't hear about any of the mainstream any at all and all of a sudden it here right it is just as many as ... as soon as\nToday all slides opposite of my mind right away you know how far we are some you know\nIt has gone totally crazy I mean I Will say that I was also\nI think things have already gone totally crazy I mean when you have a police officer standing down at riots when you have a rice and being sent to political leaders when you have bombs beings into political leaders\nYou know sure there are no deaths or casually that we're willing to walk up to a civil war at least not yet\nI mean we've had two men were beaten to death in Manhattan during a standoff between a Proud Boys an anti by figure who's the Proud Boys the ... the beat down to the anti five members\nBut those are two deaths that will not be a tribute to any civil war and the fact is is that nobody is going to get on a TV Donald Trump is not on TV and say I hereby declare a civil war that's not how it's done\nCivil wars are not cleared civil wars are actually called civil wars after the fact and the thing is is when you're in the middle of one you don't realize you're in the middle and once you start noticing a lot of strange things going on where people are at each other they're fighting with each other they end up killing each other\nOr it's not an armed conflict\nAre always it's a war of ideologies it's more of a factions in and union then and other groups that have interest that they wanted to see their interests be heard and tap into their riots or marches they're blocking traffic there ah\nYou know there were a hostage situation that happened and you don't go down and uh you know you don't necessarily have to have an armed conflict for civil war it just that when you were in our when I was in Argentina\nUh the armed conflicts where we're between certain groups of certain factions military versus police police for instance military or their own version the national guard on the streets going from door to door taking out people in there in in the middle of the night these are things that happen all the time and this type of atmosphere\nYeah and that's one thing I Want to touch on him and if I could ask her a son who is on a quest shuttle so as well that what that rings a bell said well what that says some martial law and you know\nHow far off salt marsh ... like what what is going to take ... to ... or something like a\nJohn comment on martial law\nUh yeah it's kinda hard to hear it sounds like he's too far off\nOf this stuff is all Cold War stuff for some people need to concentrate on remember back in the forties and fifties\nThat's what they do they go behind the scenes the American public is aware of it and they're going to do that without a doubt the open which is typical pro war tech so my answer\nWas no he wants to know about martial law what would trigger a martial law\nSo yeah yeah we we discuss or stuff like that that capital soccer when he was questioned at some point because there's two systems of government\nAnd if we go to military tribunals their president has already as the commander in chief to go ahead and take action declare temporary martial law these indictments on these people or so coal untouchable\nAnd put them through automatic tribunals of it gets them put away real quick but indictments based on information than the arrests and then through some sort of the tribunal and then after that it goes off and all that she can think about that so yeah\nThere you go I appreciate the call the sewage villain for college go back to uh Brian in Nevada Hi Brian you're in ground zero [noise] bright in the ... second time he has to be right there when I talk to you okay at that time I wait it out there go ahead I bet thank you [laughter]\nSo uh I hate to be an attack of this year but I I Believe you have a quite a few listeners that are disagreeing that we are in a civil war\nThere not disagreeing at all they just don't know what a civil war is they don't know what it feels like the ...\n... what is the definition of a war\nWell civil war and there are two different things no no no no that may explain don't do I'm trying to tell you when you talked about war in general it's an armed conflict am I right or wrong or right okay so when you have a civil war is not necessarily an armed conflict\nCivil wars are not necessarily armed conflicts down before you get it wrong up your own definition no I'm not making my own definition you want me to find a definition for him just definitional ... civil war now in a war between citizens of the same country symbols that\nFor a definition of a war\nNo civil war and war between countries are two different things\nTo say no wars are not necessarily fought with guns\nFor their ideology against their ideas there I mean and and when you're talking about an armed conflict yeah sorry or what do you call it high bone between ... what do you call the rice and it's a biological attack what do you call a pipe bombs what do you call it or what do you call that\nJob that is our government working against us that\nSweating war at the government again either well it's people against the government at the police against the military to military that's what a civil war is\nNo no no that that wasn't even the people doing that that race tack constricted by the government\nEven if it is are constrained by the government if the government against the people into civil war\nBut it's still not war is war it's a tactic of war therefore it creates a political changes terrorism it's domestic terrorism okay there we go civil terrorism right which which part of a terrible war absolutely oh it's a civil war did\nSorry [laughter] anyway your definitions matter

show and he's not there and then I go back to him is not there and then he comes on my show and proceeds to tell me that my definition of civil war is not what he likes\nIt just it just it's annoying when you're trying to get messages out to people and they're not willing to have a conversation or do what the right way\nOkay little to no kidding it's Samantha Tony you're on ground zero\n[laughter] I tell you what yeah ... ... what you John Clemens right you're right this is definitely entail I mean these supposedly carried by a courier they have\nStamps on 'em that aren't cancelled they ... they went through the mail they have no markings on um one went to Eric Holder all the way back to Florida with no markings on the stamps no cancellation things nothing there pristine envelopes\nYou know what I mean it's just it's every marker the intel community and it just blows me away you know they stick an ISIS sticker on one of them you know the obvious that this is this is this is what what people are hung up on Clyde is this is asymmetric or this isn't\nYet for North and all that guy with a symmetrical warfare and they don't ... it's a really good yes\nAnd at the end of the day what it will boil down to is the police state cracking down yes they're going to use\nIt's the end of the day what it will boil down to is the police state cracking down yes they're going to use this to clamp down on people like you on Alex Jones that don't work out the the line of the the government and the establishment media they want to make sure that that people don't disagree with what they say anymore\nAnd it will give them the justification to crack down on people that are getting out there and telling the truth and then they're not telling the line that the government once said\nYeah it is difficult for people to see a lot of people think in this country that we're too big to fail there were too big\nOf a war are way more we are way more fragile than people at I mean look at the

A. G. A. bomb or make America great again they are now calling him\nThe make America great again bummer because they're attributing it to Donald Trump they're attributing it to the Republicans they're pushing it towards the conservative saying the conservative was responsible for the bombings today and and yet none of that we've done when the shootings took place of the senators\nNothing was done the bet nature when\nThey sent the rice and but now we have trending on Twitter the mega bomber this is this is amazing and there was no there's no evidence nothing uh nothing has been released in the public\nOf any kind of a of evidence saying that it it points to a conservative or some right wing extremist or something but now it's already turning on the Internet that it's the make America great again bomber\nThis this obviously happened today as a way of creating ... for the masses\nThey're falling for it\nAnd it's coming even stronger when the um on these migrants get to the borders or the border of the United states if they are allowed to and I have a strong feeling they will be allowed to because Trump will be put to test um if you take a look at everything that is happening right now\nAnd you stop the allies okay that\nYou and by the close to the same age\nWe never ... or anything like this this is the most exciting time to be alive in America and please do not ever confuse the word exciting with enjoyable\nRight because they are not stomach but they are exciting we are looking at and we have a president who get way back when okay a President Trump who declared a state of emergency\nMhm now if you look into that state of emergency that basically will bring in a state of martial law\nWell we're talking about how he an act that he reenacted emergency powers yes he did that I could have timber eleven three did that after September eleventh and uh\nHave you been jak one of our callers called in and he reaffirmed that to us he says yes theory of preventing after they did that when do we do they do the task to the emergency system in every cell phone\nWhich was another ah as a way to get people thinking what's happening now you see after all that took place you see the writing riots were happening in in Manhattan see the riots were happening here in Portland and then from there we now have\nThe the bombings uh the the rice and being sent the bombings now that have happened\nI said that there would be a final blow\nI didn't know what to do or how to count or want to point out to be the final blow someone sent me a headline today that even the Daily Beast it talked about\nEverything from Kavanaugh on with the rice and and now the bombs were the final blow and I might be while either they listen to me or or they may sent the headline out to try and confirmed that it was amazing when that happened\nI I totally I totally agree I totally agree with everything I totally agree that we are on a press that were standing there right now we're looking at a world that is teetering but\nMost people also need to understand is not only get eight to clear that state of emergency okay I'm going to say some things that a purely my opinion and they're not conjecture that based on that but this is what I see\nBut I predict may happen All right\nWe have what could be as many as five hundred million guns in private hands in this country that is one of them any military and more than most military combined on the planet part of the reasons the United states has never been taken over is because\nNothing like that exist on the planet\nHow many what percentage would you figure of those could be as many as five hundred million guns belonged to\nGun toting conservatives who are huge Trump followers how many of them would welcome US Marshal law if ... rock the so called out of control and stuff like Democrat progressive in to line\nWell okay I mean you I agree to a certain degree but here's something else okay so while you're talking about the guns\nYou know that the other side is talking about collapse of the economy just to make Donald Trump look bad they'd be willing to sacrifice the economy so we have one of the willing to take up arms we have another group that's willing to sacrifice or at least\nThe economy so we have one group that's willing to take up arms we have another group that's willing to sacrifice or at least destroy the economy and or to prove a point about Donald Trump\nEconomy's going to go down either way\nAll of us who look no the air is going to be something that's going to there's going to be a reset I'm not telling you it's going to be in six weeks it may be six years there is going to the eagle monetary reset and one of these days you like your geography and we will discuss that that is a there are so many fold out there and say\nSo there is going to me it was the only thing is what I had heard by will look very good sources to deliver the making is that when Trump got what they were going to collapse economy by the second year of Hillary's first her\nWhen Trump took office they realized how much more money that sucked out of your pocket my pocket and basically decided at that point a lot so that would exist now that the ... a lot of collapsed economy until Trump let off\nA lot of conjecture this is what I heard this is what I see now\nTake a look at what's happening with international thanks for the last couple of days takes a look at their stocks\nTake a look how many of 'em are jumping out of windows\nI look at the point is dropping because of geopolitical tension and the geopolitical down right now is hurting us the stock market but I don't know about going to be a major collapse but\nI over discussions today from a from a maintenance man you are our radio station is in bankers hall it's all the bankers around me was that was over hearing a lot of businessmen today and they're just saying ah you know be ready for a tanking because\nUh you know and and I actually heard a banker used the word civil war he says the civil war we're in right now is going to collapse the economy and we need to be prepared upper gas prices go up advice to go up and the economy to fall and I said well if I don't want\nTo eat those all the Federal Reserve will collapse the economy it will be there at politicians it won't leave those puppets who sit on the board of directors of the Fed's ... will be um the child so on and so forth the word will come down when the economy goes down and they won't be anything we can do about it\nBut I Believe Sean does have a play and again\nThat's another show but I think he expects within the end of his first term or they're going to the second term to see a major global um bubble ... thank you\nYeah there are certainly something that uh you know the economy of ah one thing that I've avoided it ignored because\nAt one time you get very yeah were you see a major collapse and another time those that were that collapse coming from and usually if you if you get really really directed you get really defined\nIf a guarantee that nothing's going to happen so I'm standing by and watching the the slow trickle down fall with what we have going on but the the violence the symptoms of violence the problems we're seeing\nA certainly are are part of what I said before a with regard to how the military would define a the the beginnings of civil war civil war itself infringe national poorer polarization with obvious\nNew meeting place for a resolution increasingly divisive press coverage of information flows weaken
