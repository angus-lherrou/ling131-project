want me to\nWell I'll do it out at a given price scored on a one yard touchdown pass from Kate in Florida making seven and I think they decided that wasn't long enough and so it was darker Stewart taking a a a an interception back forty eight yards back at fourteen\nAnd we're taking a a a an interception back forty eight yards to make at fourteen to nothing at five twenty three the tigers for four times and the opening quarter\nEight thirty five yard touchdown pass to Devin prize pushed it up to Twenty one another and then sent personal going across the middle of content passing pulled

another ten yards spring parents and it moved to thirty five to forty two to nothing with Devin price catching a fifty one you order and uh then Julius our getting at thirty two yard run to make it forty nine and nothing and then just before Hampton and sonic with no time remaining and don't have time\nIt was random guy taking a twenty yard field goal and that made it forty nine to three I was thirty or we'll go with it and and ah thirty are zero to make it forty nine three that's where we are right now and you were\nAnd the lions will have a first Jenna thrown twenty five yard line or in the third quarter now\nSanctions can hand it straight ahead that scar Dina said he powers forward and then gets shoved back at the end of that they they might've pulled the ball is but not the case don't cutting the snow got it but he goes into heartedly gangs about five yards on that first downplay hurting us has been the best well getting more than that again six on that one\nHurting this has been the best officers they've had so far just running straight ahead it at a left right guard\nWas good to see him back in the ball game in the second half after being pulled in the first half due to that looked like some kind of little injury\nYeah look like he got a little banged up on one play but he didn't have any trouble getting off the field or anything no\nHanded to him again no to keep\nThis time they gotta look why this without this thrown away there were doubled coverage on the outside insects didn't try to throw it to Marcos Marcos and nobody he had no way to get it into him there were two tigers over there waiting for the past to be thrown it was thrown but it was over everybody said\nHabit that mature ... sophomore quarterback throwing the ball away when he obviously had nowhere to go and it was under pressure\nStill checking it around though electric lines drawn to as we mentioned bill for the future this is not a team that you think is likely to go to the playoffs this year\nEspecially with my German getting when they still do have Montgomery\nOn the schedule in Montgomery ahead though that I\nJust dropped back pressure comes light pass across the middle good delivery catches made after the forty yard line first time we've seen or we've seen in a little bit before wide receiver but I don't know the swan is caught a pass but this time of Britain's one who's gonna return man all night check next to the yard line that will be a first down for like ...\nAnd the third quarter and a consolidated holds eight fifty five to three advantage we are at\nNine fourteen clock is running and it's a first down for like great\nIf they continue to run card Cardenas has been the hand out to him on first Down's been almost a given\nThis time they throw a pass to the outside quick reception tigers arrived there to bring down the parents catcher who's who's rhyme Lipscomb might have gained a yard I'm not even sure he got that far they'll spot that football actually out to the forty one yard line so you get a yarn on apply\nJust a quick delivery everything comes in\nYou know quickly but it doesn't look like it's a hard ball to catch when Sexton throws and everybody seems to bring those things in pretty plainly\nSecond down at nine Sexton\nWhat Cardenas to his left\nA hand off that he gives to Cardenas including slips his way through the metal pretty good run this time he was trying to sweep it to the ride but he cut down sharply I don't think it's within Alex is a\nA system to uh\nTo uh spend a whole lotta time running around the corner and I think he wants to cut it up and go north and south\nDown and seven\nAnd almost eight that they need to pick up first and\nWhich is surprising because Alex looks like he's got some quickness and he could get to the outside but of course console does have some speed\nWatched them a little on Hulu and he does I mean he's got some things you can do they'll throw a spring pass to him as well\nThere is a drop pass across the middle passes incomplete try to go to his tidy and and he was playing time in that time who is dating sweating but it was behind swinging well behind him closest player there was a tiger defensive back then the other punting situation\nAnimated punches away we'll be Carter berry and he'll take it away to a new consolidated dropping back deep for the

sector setting up for a handout but no they'll play fake and they'll go to the right side and that is Floyd at a receiver he's going to be very close to reverse down maybe a yard shortly after the thirty seven yard line had to give them thirty eight to pick it up\nIt's always got a lot of weapons do they yeah they do celebrate the tigers are ... and a lot of those guys are out there in open spaces that's the thing and you know and they get other guys out there to our it's not beyond slipping into the slot becoming a receiver\nDating for Dora long stamped out\nAnd he's just burning some of the clock it was a high snap and they do handed to Howard Howard spot around and he's not too far beyond the sticks but he does every first down\nThat might be the the shortage play in a while it

there and here's how it up the metal cuts back to the left he's got the thirty yard line\nGot another block and he was going to take it all the way down to the end zone and one more time Devin prize ought to get some kind of extra points for the block that he throws down field\nStores to touch down in the end zone what four fifty two to Joe and the third quarter it's now sixty one two three second consecutive way that they've given up sixty one point slate gray\nYeah David cross drove his defenders to God that was defending him he's twenty yards down the field and when he sees Julius our

through the board they'd been with the forever but that's when I was able to open up to them\nAnd they speak to report for many many years in the last several years that they've been able to
