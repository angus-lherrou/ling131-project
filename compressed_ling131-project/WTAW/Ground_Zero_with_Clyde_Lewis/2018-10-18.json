Congress dollar range from lifting [noise] thanks for calling I uh I I was wondering how\nYou remember the episode of the outer limits like it was the eighties versus series\nCalled there was an episode called trial under fire and there was a presidential election and all that occupation day\nSomething strange happening on the moon and the president's whisked away a bunker well these events are true to the uh the the theory of ... you know real life is stranger than fiction\nI'm thinking perhaps the timing of this asteroid are easy to do is right in line with some of that story line if you recall\nBut there are a lot of things and you know people people tend to\nRemember certain science fiction stories and stuff like this goes down in the one I remember was Harry housings bird versus a flying saucer everything didn't work and then they started getting signals and finally the aliens arrived and they just wreak havoc on everything you're saying you know you know we want to speak to your leadership\nWhere it looks to your son for warning there'll be a big sun burst and not let you know that something's about to go down and I mean have you I don't know if you remember that scene but they go\nPeople of earth attention look to your son\nFor a warning look to your son for a warning after after sun spots of explosions on the sun you will see armada show up and you'll be ready to surrender to us it was just amazing how they they they pulled it off and of course when you lose the war of the world's it's about a asteroids coming from the from a Mars\nAre hitting the planet tonight it's a shutting down due to be some nights at something hit the moon and then of course the budgets for protecting our\nOur planet go up Ninety million dollars a year we got rockets that can't work we've got ... telescopes in X ray telescopes that aren't working something is going on it's bizarre\nIt's in the in a strange time to be alive and I can't thank you and run it through enough for reporting that actually matters\nI appreciate your calling in and I think your genes thank you so much that the genes calling it a night to go to John in Ohio Hi John you're on ground zero\nThat guy I don't if they were doing good\nAnd there with that our caller show got off of work like the topic and I had to call it you know what I'm saying I I go outside on my breaks overtime always watched Lone Star seeing the Mona night looked like Mars or ... or one next to it but as I was watching\nIt looked like something less than I thought it was another star but it started to move\nLiterally from the mom looked just like a star\nMove and then just vanished I don't know what it was but that after her to show that night I had to call and tell you what I say that I felt like it confirmed or I saw it and I\nHad no idea what it could have been what I saw that movie and I just\nSo you saw something moving away from the moon was heading towards Mars I mean there's a red dot in the sky and that is that you see the red dot in the sky right when you look to the southern sky\nRight yes yeah directly across from it I was glad I did mine about two o'clock from the moon when you say Yes sir yeah okay\nSo the the is about two o'clock for the moon you see the ... you see it there and then you said you saw something pull away from the moon\nIt looked like something just looked like a store or something just took off from the ... I I never said I don't know how to explain because I'd never seen nothing like it I just I felt like they showed like retarded I seen it just it just it moved away from the movie is directly yes because it just looked like a star I thought it was another\nFlorida sky or something that does but it is a little did I Know there's a a a meteor shower and area of the night but it wasn't it wasn't that quick made it like\nThey did is supposed to be a meteor shower tonight I heard there was supposed to be one but last night there wasn't supposed to be one day I I don't know maybe ... yeah I don't I usually Janine and I go to these meteor showers we go out to rooster rocket we watch them if we have time so I was supposed\nTo be on here in Cincinnati tonight but it wasn't like that it was just a slow steady stream it just it looked like but I don't know how to describe like a rocket and just took off from the moon and it was it was the oddest thing I've ever seen in the sky\nWow well at least we got you as a witness and you saw something in the sky some weird UFO\nYes sir thank you John for the call I really appreciate it and like\nI Want to remind you that uh if you want to listen to this program\nAfter if you want to go back to the program after we're on SoundCloud\n... dot coms I was ground zero media listen to ground zero dot com available to people especially when we go into the later hours run listen to ground zero dot com\nAnd uh\nYeah ... it just to keep our eyes on what's going on your keep your eyes to this guy's too because I think a lot of people are curious as to what's going on\nI mean I don't know it just like all the coincidence I mean think about it I mean a lot of people are probably thinking that this is all not nonsense but you wouldn't read what's going on mainstream media is not going to talk about this\nCertainly aren't going to talk about in in ... we got to get used to be ideal they're not going to talk about it and just because it's being talked about on the show like mine rather shows it's not conspiracy theory this is happening okay tell me why\nWe have two major telescope shutdown\nTell me why it's so use rocket couldn't go to the I asked that tell me why the rovers shut down as well all three of these uh ways we can see the space of shut down right\nYou to shut down last night because someone said they were pushing a video by really about something hitting the moon last night\nAnd so they wanted to take it down and they had to shut it down to\nGet on the Internet before anybody saw unless you've done a good job because I don't see it I didn't see the man of the uniform they're talking about but there is some footage right now they put on my Facebook page Facebook dot coms ground zero\nWhere you can look at this should be some night did you did you see something passing across the sky for the two main Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that Tripoli except for three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero and we'll be back\nOf the man in the military uniforms saying that somebody's going to hit the moon but until then we have not found it\nWell I ... certainly certainly don't want us to not allow said I Want to ask for all I don't know I was that there are still pretty savvy so he said it was like\nThank you Margie thank you for calling this program was go to Jason in Ohio Hi Jason you're on ground zero\nThat evening Clyde hey I've got a theory about this remember about three years ago up in Antarctica they discovered something but they never really told us what it was right at the religious a leader from Russia there are rumors that President Obama\nThat up there I think maybe what happened up there as they discovered a shift for a city or something and they've tripped like uh oh like a distress signal mhm and then you know the sunspot Arizona facility solve the ships coming in and around the sun and they shut that down\nAnd that made me last night the ships or you know around the mood or whatever and uh they went ahead and shut all that down and shut down YouTube and everything you know maybe it took that long for a signal to get all the way out the space\nAnd for whoever contacted the come all the way back in because you know you set the little uh the short radio burst mhm and uh\nThey they actually backed by the way I'm Glad you brought that up Nineteen more detected last night or in the ... observatory in Australia Nineteen more obese fast radio burst were actually\nSent and someone had sent me a story that Russia has said that uh they are now calling them the flashes of solar cells cells they're not calling them or they're not calling fast radio versus what Russia's officially said they believe that they are flashes from solar cells of extraterrestrial ships that is what Russia says\nWell and that may be so maybe they're trying to contact they a signal that was set off\nAnd they're not getting a response so you know they're they're wondering who sent a signal and what happened and why it's been so long\nI mean it's just a theory like any other theory but ... I mean it is kinda strange that everything that's going on and everything they're trying to hide from us and uh you know I just thought I'd bring that up and mentioned that since you're all that\nTall I appreciate that yeah it's a very strange night in any theory or I mean\nYou know everything is all about ah right now hypothesis and speculation everything's hypothetical until we prove\nNumber of things about what we do know is is that two of those uh telescopes were shut down the so he was rock and he's not going to be I assess the rover on Mars had shut down a we know that they shut down to sunspot observatory on September sixth no one told us why it was shut down we including as to why we shut down\nWe now have a budget of sixty million going to protect the planet from\nIncoming asteroid the shut up to a hundred and fifty million dollars a that was overnight they got\nFunded overnight for that and it's almost like why do we have to increase the money but it's not really that big of a threat well now I think they're thinking it's a threat because it's something that happened last night the fact that you to shut down without notice and people are saying it's because some guy had a viral video saying something's going to hit the moon\nAnd they didn't want anybody see it\nYeah it's absolutely too much to be a coincidence you know there's definitely some gone I Will probably never know exactly what\nYeah and another thing to Jason have you been noticed I don't know if you're on the Internet that often have you been noticing these UFOs that have been seen in the sky they're not UFOs the rockets and there'd been like these errant rockets flying all over China and California and all these places\nYeah yeah that's kinda weird because that's a little out of the norm for you know your regular UFO side in or whatever\nYeah these lawsuits that yes there were these rockets going to and what are we trying to hit out of the sky I mean are these ... missiles to bring out or to take out UFOs or whatever I mean there's been a lot of that going on to I've been posted on those pictures they've been UFOs\nIs it will do this UFO it's not a UFO you can tell that these are rocket ships these rockets or missiles being fired\nA ... a there was one over a South Korea I saw some lights that were up ... said that could have been rockets one over China and won over California and I think the one where California was another rocket fired by a either basis or mosque so but other than that we don't know what they are\nNow but there's an awful lot of activity going on and you know for them not to even mention anything and I'm sure where that comes out you know YouTube will have a a some kind of excuse to what we needed to update in the middle of the night or anything like that and I think it'll all be crazy bogus\nWas there and certainly jeopardize our work last night we didn't know what was going to solve the simple because those are the simple shut down but then we started hearing about you know a guy who was there and I had another I had a guy like you said send me a a sent me an email did you get this one of the guy who's\nThe military guys if something's going to hit the moon no that didn't happen I didn't see it I didn't even know was there and then comes the story\nThen comes the shutdown and going on that's what he was talking about All right Jason I appreciate the call All right thank you very well but it's going to Mike in Pennsylvania Hi Mike you're on ground zero\nDay as good a got a little different take on this we connect the dots stuffed you said about what's going on in it and they're grown to ... ... square clouds therapy and\nObserve or could it possibly be\nThe ... so the planet access to the end or you know or they well\nIt's just moving into you know or they\nWell as a matter of fact did you hear what they were reporting in the news about three or four weeks ago we just showing it was called the goblin remember the goblins story [noise] uh no I didn't\n... well they have discovered a planet and uh they call it the goblins and of course before that they discovered Vulcan\nSo ah what it is is that it's a dwarf planet or about two weeks ago that because they were hunting for planet X. by the way and ah they found is a ... a long way to orbit this uh this dwarf planet beds along gated orbit they're calling it the goblet okay\nUm and uh they they said that uh uh they they don't know they're they want to call the planet X or not but it's not new bureau okay\nBut they're saying they were looking for planet actually found this planet are called twenty Fifteen T. G. three eight seven about eighty astronomical units from the sun uh\nBasically this ... this is between the ... that's an astronomical unit is so uh Pluto was thirty four astronomical units from the sun ... about two and a half times farther away from the sun is Pluto right now so he found this planet called ... and they're wondering what you called planet X but it's not\n... it's just the goblin that's what they're calling it the goblet\nThat's interesting well maybe it's not these movie or the world's maybe it's these movie one worlds collide\n[laughter]\n[laughter] yeah that's true it's off the Mike thank you for that that's great that's great yeah what\nHe does win world guide or a was that movie called melancholy or I don't remember that movie villain calling boring movie I mean it was it was so boring until the end I mean I wanted I wanted to be an interesting film because it was about the earth colliding with another planet\nThat's how the movie ends and so rather than sitting through the boring boring movie of this girl having you know problems with their marriage or getting married and not want to be married and\nThen I don't know just boring boring film but the the the depiction of the planet colliding with earth\nWas so intense it was intense and in\nFact they were saying oh it's not going to hit the earth it's going to loop around and miss us by that much\nBut no it hits us\nAllies with it I couldn't imagine I just can't imagine what it would be like to collide with\nAnother plan you imagine that this crazy [noise] I don't know ... six seven three thirty seven hundred a triple a victim at three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero we'll be back [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nThis online banks for closing on how they even have documents for science for home equity loan only I didn't what ... ...\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on line where themes foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like\nThis police officer I Know about title fraud so I register with home title walking discovered some things had already taken over title thank God I found out on time\nNo bank I don't eat that program or insurance protects you\nHold title lock will for pennies today hold tight lock puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on it helping to shut it down find out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free which sign up this at home title luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com\nMessaging database ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career in case you access to a world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text prepare to seven nine six four or five", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "College Station", "day": "18"}
