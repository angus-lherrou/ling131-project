remember I'm Nick Redfern the writer\nWrote a book that I read\nAnd it talks about the ... family or the or the the elite Collins blood line and I thought well it's just crazy man that whole Collins group or the Collins elite or the columns Thirteen or whatever\nAnd then of course a one day I met for spring Meyer another a person who writes about the blood lines of the women are the families and he's going up on the ... family and I'm thinking you know okay um what proof do we have and uh someone said to me he was well you know every time\nYou know they write stories about vampires other write stories about you know I'm you know different types of secrets aside all families that kind of hit that the Collins family and he pointed out dark shadows they pointed out all these other shows that you know yeah OK common would I understand that and\nYou know everything else and so I just kind of like the and I thought man what someday I'd want to talk about this because I think it's interesting\nAnd I'm Nick Redfern gave us a call the other day and I told him I said you know I Know you just wrote a book about aliens because he did he ... he wrote this book about aliens\nAnd I said I'm reading that right now but you know you wrote a book a long time ago about the call and sweet and you wrote about how their family they go all the way back to the druids and um\nAnd how are you know their names of the yo Colin\nHow would you say this ... or ... or it's old cue and actually subscribe to OCU I. L. L. E. A. I. N. O. coil in or oh Collins and how they establish themselves as the elite family and they're part of the Thirteen most powerful bloodlines\nAnd you know when you're hearing about it will eliminate conspiracy everybody says well what about the Rockefeller's what about the Rothschild and it's all but like they were talking about okay\nAnd I remember coming to Portland and someone said you need to go to Astoria okay and I said why because the asteroids the extra bloodline you know who they are no\nSo I studied all about the asked your bloodline and how you know the asteroids were also kind of a band parrot bloodline and all these mysterious families the Bundys and the Collins and the ...\nAnd I and some of the names like the dupont's for example they were involved with ah the say on trying to bring forward been council of benign which of course these nine demons or these nine agents that are here they want to bring them forward from the Easter\nAnd I got to thinking about our to crochet and I got to thinking about how he\nAbroad forward a character called lam which was a bold creature they called the monkey was and then you have ... Parsons Ron Hubbard and you have the Bible and working and John B and Kelly what they did I brought them up during my ground zero lounge or a ground zero Halloween party that I had the other night\nI don't think people really understood I was talking about but the idea of the uh the ritual is um and magic and creating the monkey ... or at least creating a Gen or a gala or or something\nBut how about the idea of creating a vampire or creating a night stalker which would go out and in order to a ... in order to satisfy the creator\nBenign stock or has to go from house to house taking people against their will sometimes removing things from their body whether it be their vital organs for their blood\nAnd taking it back to some strange group some strange elite group in order for them to have good health you know what I'm saying I mean we were talking about the unite the ambrosia group\nBut now they've gone forward they said okay well we'll have a clinic in New York now and people volunteer to give blood and people who volunteer to get shots eight thousand dollars gets you a shovel the blood\nOkay\nBut when you're dealing with secret societies okay when you're dealing with the nature most powerful nature of these secret societies\nIt's hard to pinpoint just where the real uh called power of ancient European bloodlines comes from and the traditions of the oldest high kings of Ireland that had at their disposal\nThe holy ones are the surfing the ... the ... the calling snakes in fact the colon ... name again\nMeans coil or also ah what coils in the woods\nUm and then of course leg coy lay\nAnd beans physician so you have the the ... physician in the woods or the one who carries the snake on the poll hundreds [laughter] okay\nSo a combination of probably the most primitive Gaelic words of ... and would render a little something like the blind medicine man of the woods or divine holy man or more accurate and likely title for the first druids\nBasically snake oil under staffed with the cross bar the blood letters and the blood drinkers who knows but still it's fascinating because we're looking at the ... the ... the colon Collins families\nThey represent literal tiger's actually titles there are the first ... drew a dynasty the divine medicine men of the woods the vine holy men who drink the blood and bring eternal life [noise]\nBut of course\nMeans night stocking demons that have been some and and had been summoned for well over for many years thousands of years\nThe culprits according to rent for his contact with paramilitary groups that take the blood in Oregon's from cattle and humans in order to be utilized an ancient sacrificial appeasement rights\nTo incredibly old DDT the type that can offer something in return supernatural powers type that understood and harnessed may even be weaponized\nSounds like a and then when I was was reading about that it sounds like the gym or it sounds like you know I'm I don't know the idea of just summoning a gym or among kill us are creating a monster in order to\nAttack\nOr the sort of thing it's a [laughter] it's\nPretty amazing actually go to um go to leach is that your name leach highly ... million how you doing buddy\n[noise] ah [laughter] you are making my skin crawl extra Louis Howe so ah [noise] I Will eat shares my last name right\nI Am or what way descended from Collins okay ... ah was on and you make coast ... wow uh that's where the majority of my family is an doors from mhm\nUh\nWell still trying to collect my thoughts 'cause there's so many pieces that are kind of Wyoming together in my head um ever since I was little\nI have and fascinated and ... with the damn hires a ... they didn't scare me at all I Do I Want it to be ...\nWell keep in mind is I mean the Collins control them okay\nThe comments controlled the vampires\nSo whatever you know you wouldn't want to mess with the cones family\nOr the uh ... because they control the vampires they were the ones that control life and death they were the ... with the medicine men they were the a pop and carry a workers they were the ones that were able to promote health or take away health they had the power of life and death in their hands\nSo they all has been over there was that you don't have\nTo I got away from the old wanting to be a vampire thing yes but I still had white\nAnd attraction that was a um and also the the ... the same way that kind of made me think of ah the old school doctors that would use ... to\n... to end or purify you know there's the old are your thing mhm they're used us yes uh-huh\nWell sorry I'm I'm a bit of a jumble at some of them and um but yeah the whole dark shadows staying coast maintained and my family is tall and\nYeah like my my dad's mother ... is a Collins and my dad's dad is a ... wage so\nWell you know you know what your your name itself view if you ... you know when you're talking about leeches and blood and\nAnd that sort of thing it's just the idea that the name itself bleach okay is actually taken from the water itself\nMeaning that um you know if if your last name as leech a of course I'm it's the it's from the word uh uh well it means leach means the what the leeches they use for medical purposes but it's also meaning\nThe war is like taking the boardwalk or look which of course is the\nIs the old word for those who work on the lake or those who work on the water\nSo right I'm yet to leach of ... is this thing I'd say a flood yeah the leads takes the blood away it's what it is the right to the doctor applies leeches for medical reasons and then from there it was like whatever or whomever worked on the water also got the name leach is well there's like latch there's which would you courses\nAgain another a strange\nA ... a creature of which is of course a resurrected a zombie like being a witch\nAnd then we have leaves lay magical one yeah a magical magic old a ... that does not die um it comes back from the dead the ledge though I mean it it's interesting and all those names in the ... come together the ...\nAh leach which ah connections of you know that which takes the blood and not which uses the blood to live forever it's it's the same origins of the name\nAnd again I'm not sure of all of this it just in my head but it seemed like stuff was falling together as your talking about the colonies and controlling the ... ... everything else and then you know the whole each Collins\nAm ways that I Am part of ... and the fact that as I said a water and English Irish yep\nAre ready to marry and then all coming over to the east coast places like Maine and others\nAre the Delaware and other places where they came and they and they and they actually settled there that upon settled there are other ... people came in a lot of them in a lot of these ah looming all your bloodline families settled in places like Maine and a Massachusetts and all these places\nYou know I was born and raised in a much skating callers because I don't want to be part of the aluminum ... family [laughter] you started throwing just together and I'm like oh God no\nWell blame that blame that on print spring Meyer and blame that on a Nick Redford because ah I read this stuff and I just thought it was interesting because it just made me think of dark shadows that he'd be sure dark shadows and Barnabas Collins so thinking yeah of course okay [laughter] so do I bet you recall like go to Garret in Delaware Hi Garret you're on ground zero\nHello Mr Lewis good evening I was just calling because I Am from Delaware uh-huh\nAnd even though I'm not part of the blood line I actually spent a lot of time down to Wilmington known public library which is a monument that dupont spilt sure ... square it's Wellington Delaware mhm yeah and I'm there I was telling the\nSo called clean or there's a lot of this still symbols all along this building is like ancient Rome and build them basically with the columns and everything but along the top there is\nYou know I'm kind of shocked that it's still there there's a swastika and in the dupont's defense this was built before Hitler's rise\nRemember that the swastika and this is something that was interesting I saw something on the Internet the other day I think uh uh I'm just trying to figure what somebody was showing the swastika and saying this evil similar not\nThe swastika Lewis show the Hitler swastika which of course the reason the difference between the ancient swastika and the Hillary swastika is very simple the swastika alone is an ancient symbol or the Hitler\nWell the swastika alone is an ancient symbol or the Hitler swastika is tilted it's tilted in such a way that it looks like it's marching job you see a following and tilted whether it's bent over the it's a bent cross tilted that is the swastika there's the symbol of evil the other swastikas there's engine symbols of peace\nAnd well being but when you take a look at the the ... the swastika was provided by the Nazis you will get a swastika ... was killed it just check it out to be the the artist of this wants to give it to submitted to Hitler he was also a doctor I Believe\nAnd all he did as he took the swastika dangerous symbol if you just king that a little bit oh humid that look of a of a bent cross it's a ... it's it's the symbol of been crosses wanted it\nI can assure you this one is not built the only other thing is that I Know some people from Philadelphia and they told me some scary stories do possible was some kind of murder\nMystery they were involved with where one of the dupont's was killed some people over ... he said is because of the the wealth of the family that they just will it off I don't know if that thing to do with the vampire blood

thinking to myself [noise] but that's one of the reasons why as I said you know what I'm Sorry about predicted programming and horror films and what are the biggest horror films to come out one of the scariest horror films come out what's hereditary\nI don't know if anybody's seen it yet but one of the things I've noticed about a lot of horror films lately\nIs they come up with these demons that no one is heard of and and what they do is they present them as these strange demons that are being worshipped by people when it gets frightening I mean when you're looking at the none\nOf the movie the non it comes from the movie the contract talks about a demon called vow like\nAnd I've talked about the the ... valley in people you know they don't they're not aware of the demon valley they don't know what it is and what about and there was another movie can't remember the name of it but they were actually I'm dealing with another demon that was a a course deep and the demon that was part of horse park man\nAnd they released added the demon that was presented was one woman things coming Malia can't remember the name of the nation in the ... the ... the movie or something about Mali\n[noise] and then of course hereditary where the the the or the demon or the devil or whatever it is\nBut it is a that is the secret\nA is a demon origin that is called ... and you know people that I go and who the hell is pilot and why should I why should I be worth his time on this yet another example of a surgeon who if you do what he tells you to do\nIt will grant you whatever you want it'll give you whatever you want and this is what worries me is because we we're in a time\nOf supernatural conjuring a rose Mary Ellen guy Lee and fill up in broken wrote a book called the vengeful gin and\nIn the book it's an excellent study of the entire gym phenomena from a historical supernatural cultural perspective\nSo there's one part of the book the focus is on a trip to fill up in broke no made to Saudi Arabia Nineteen Ninety five and during the course of the visit it broke no learned of a secret long term there will be secret long term a chance an attempt by the special unit US military\nTo conjure and capture Jim ... and broke no was told by accustomed to prince ... bin ... odd that the purpose of the program was to secure the U. S. government a technological device that would open up a wormhole\nWhich would allow the gym to pass through a dimensional doorway so they get people thinking get their minds taking about perhaps the wave computers thinking about um a CERN and what they may be using what they're doing with the ... computers\nAnd and how people like Jody rose it said we can bring things through and they're not necessarily aliens but they're not necessarily demons you hear the same theme running around with the Collins elite you'd save been running around\nSomething is being ... brought through the wormhole so what could they could they be June and could they be brought through some ancient van period June or I'm not sure so many names are for these creatures I mean\nBut a hundred by mankind something that we cannot they did once they're unleashed they do the bidding of the one who ... who greets them\nShow while visiting Oman this guy this in\nBroken Arrow guy filled it broke now heard a story of the governments of Oman and the United states both knowing about gin and knowing that they have to deal with them because if they're unleashed it creates\nA creates a blood letting them sort of ... it's like the power to the gym creates a bloodline concerts they can control the whether they can control all kinds of things with the gym\nAnd they think about ... the blend in well with everyone else you don't even know the difference between a a real June or a human or in the gym because they they basically occupy the same look in the same space they can they can ... people okay and so they have\nTo be a exercised in a special way\nIt's not like the same Satan versus a priest type thing that you're dealing with you're dealing with something else it's kinda like when we talked about the big box without depicts are a lot different than demons but they have the same attributes in June too can be\nGood or bad but a lot of there will be used in warfare [noise]\nAnd it can be ... through ... and they can be you know [noise]\nThe I I'm just telling you I mean these kindred computers and these are the way computers in CERN and all these other groups who wish to open a wormhole they wish to open the abyss and bring forward\nThese demons of the structure of these genes and that they can come in trouble you fix him at three thirty seven hundred that's ... three thirty seven hundred will be back\n[noise] [noise] [noise] mine\nAnd I mean mind [noise]\nBut the difference between a binding smell on Trump and the hurtful spell that they put on Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh was supposed to feel something in this and Thomas Sheraton who basically as a practitioner and south he warned us he said\nIf they do this to justice cabin on the children will be harmed what he said he said the children will be harmed no sooner did he said is that we had six children die from at dinner virus\nWe had all these children became paralyzed with the other virus the internal viruses that the guy than there were a mimicking polio we had the young girls who plotted to kill their classmates and drink their blood\nAnd now we have the shooting going on and from there we have the shooting of a synagogue and we have the bombs being sent out and I don't know if we can attribute that to the spell for all of these things after that one day a casting a spell on on on justice Kavanaugh all of these things happened right after that\nCan I say one more thing sure I'm even saying for it so that they're listening to you for a couple of years now that they go oh it's going to Penn\nA fall guy on these things happen because you said when the um ... when they had the bomb was placed last week you said let's wait two or three days to see who takes the fall for it and they brought out to sea there say off as the fall guy\nAnd the same thing with ... of a gentleman I think and gasoline still ... and they came into that it gives the FBI mhm what they have the FBI or is all one leading investigation they put them in control of everything\nSo always foiled terrorist plot I up by the FBI knows exactly how they're going to come out they know exactly where I go on and it's always been that way so yeah\nI like playing federal you know\nExactly and and you know and they wonder why people ... false flag in the the thing is that people people abuse the word false flag because what they\nForget is is when they say that it's a false flag they forget that real people are dying real people are being harmed by this and so it's not necessarily a false flag a false flag exists when you find out\nThat someone is been pinned as a fall guy for the actions of their own government so if they're thinking that their own governors behind the synagogue shooting and they bring their own governments behind the bombings attempts or they think their own governments behind the rice and\nThen it's a false flag but I Would say this I Would say that people are motivated by other reasons not just government but there are motivators and motivations that are deeper and and far more sinister and it's in our ... and ... type of way where we're looking at the center we are looking at\nA group that is behind the scenes probably operating without any uh attention from the deep state that are doing these types of things and they are far more sinister and far more dark could have been around for a lot longer time\nThan ah than what we're giving credit for and that's what I'm seeing here in the end do you think\n... hours and a sigh a have a sold their soul or are they they did a CIA FBI as that's found a way it is to control their minds make them\nI think what what they've done I think what they've done and it's obvious to me that some of you know when we look at a crises we look at gas\nThe government or at least political figures find a way to exploited in one of the things that makes me totally sick and and it's really sad as it after the shooting in the synagogue\nAh where are these these people died it's a horrible thing and it and it's terrible\nWhat they have done do is they have now taken and they've created new speak out of it all such as ah using nationalism and an acquaintance would not see as them which is something that uh once again is is part of a weapon I sing words it's it's a it's the black magic way of\nWeaponized sing words and another way they weaponize words as they're saying if you say anything bad about George Soros\nAnd if you say anything bad about globalism it has a dog whistle for anti Semitism and it's never been that way I mean maybe some people hate George Soros because he's a Jew and if that if that's the case and\nThey may have a little anti Semitism going on but George Soros is not\nA good guy neither is Henry Kissinger and there's several other people that they deserve our scorn for what they do but that doesn't mean we're anti Semite see if we pointed out\nAnd and not only that but the idea of globalism being a Jewish conspiracy some people may think that because of design ism but it's all about imperialism and empire building the global his agenda is empire building and if you're against empire building\nIt's the very thing that we're against in World War two and so to say that it's anti Semitism\nIs once again weaponized words and that's evil\nI just have a feeling that we're going to drag to election day ... day\nI I I agree I mean they're just going to happen\nI agree we're going to try that areas it his building up yeah it is is very scary and so we should be prepared for anything under thank you for your call what a great call\nA let's go now to go to Brian in Wisconsin Hi Brian you're on ground zero\n... thanks for taking my call you back up you're a woman named the theme an
