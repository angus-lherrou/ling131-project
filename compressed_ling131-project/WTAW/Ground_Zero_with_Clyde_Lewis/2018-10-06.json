back to action here the second half get just under way as the kicker for the Montgomery Bears drop it in water as one of the most dangerous kicks it all the football and that's when you pull it really high like a punch and you give your kick team ready at the time to recover and really covered the uh\nThe uh receiver and pillows up\nKick that ball perfectly Devon price just happened to pull it down and the tigers lab but at the twenty six yard line on near disaster to start the second half of play digress for the football now penalty market goes down let's see how the second half of starting today up\nAgain this is the game now that is the new rule in football when the ball is set ready to play right after the kick the clock\nStarts ticking and so with that the tigers will start now with the first in Fifteen it was at the twenty sixth they back it up five yards [noise] twenty five six years our score consolidated at half\nTime and it was a very long halftime show both the band's doing their thing here but both of them running really law\nLate and getting a third quarter under way out of the gun goes came for Dora has a running back to his left tripped right one of the short side of the field and he pulls the trigger on a first down has a receiver it's just out of reach you wanted Brian Darby that had beaten his defender deep the bears just couldn't keep up with an oil Spurlock was\nEating his defender deep the bears just couldn't keep up with an oil Spurlock was on the cover on down the coverage there but the ball is overthrown and now brings up a second down Fifteen I guess that tells you what kind of approach the tigers are going to\nSay I am ... bears deep is just playing band demand and Darby who's one on one with his defender and nobody else was within twenty yards of all he ... he was being beat by about ... cake just over through\nThe door out with a gun Julius Howard to his left\nSplit receivers to both sides with time put ... in the pocket he there and get out once again he has a receiver that ball is in complete it will bring up a second down they continue to pick on ... and I got to give the guy credit he's saying\nNot in my neighborhood and sold ... doing a great job of coverage once again but that ball was just a little off blood as he wanted balance Jones and I will tell you if there is a player that has really stepped up the game balance Jones is a force to be reckoned with just the as\nHis name quite a few times in the first three games and called it too much to not think that the second or third time but [noise] it ... part of the office are coming into this ball game\nOn a third down Fifteen a little bit of an era snap Dora flushed out of the pocket looking for a receiver nobody there\nAnd now fires the ball down feeling completed as a horse and Fifteen and I got to tell you that opening drive was an absolute disaster the tigers taking his first because they won the coin toss the elected to the furtive a second half but on that it's going to bring on the Bertie to punt the football away what looked like a really ugly replay\nIt was ugly replays took the ball or consult tigers took the ball up your own twenty six yard line with a [noise] a delay of game penalty moved it back to the Twenty one and three and complete passes it we're just not good passes\n\nAnd now it is Jay Leno Washington back deep to receive a kick from Colby ... pretty standard about the ten yard line a little bit of a high snapped goes over his\nHead there is a scramble for\nCall and I do believe that the Montgomery Bears came up with it McCurdy unable to come up with the ball and disasters strikes with a bad snap again [noise] but at the seven yard line yes that\nWas a little bit high summit Bertie puts his hands over his head and it just goes to his fingers nonchalantly looked like he was just trying to reach down to pick it up in Montgomery ... dove onto the football and they take over the console seven yard line\nFrankly what does it matter yeah like who is three yards maybe your yard or something like that I'm In Colby was down there with it but if he fell on any doubt at that point anyway so Montgomery comes up with it after the ... uh tigers fumble the football the way\nBack into the pocket to the end zone an incomplete\nIntended on the far side and it was cold more as the intended receiver [noise] and with that is causing complete it brings up a second down gold fending for the consolidated tigers will save your Stewart [noise]\nStops the clock eleven twenty nine remaining third quarter it is a twenty five to six ball game but the recovery bears make some noise after the turn over by the tigers\nAnd it brings up a second a goal to go to line of scrimmage it right after seven yard line [noise] hand off first manned middle of the line stood up at the five scrum moves to the poor are given forward drivers there and maybe the three yard line\n[noise] wow that was big bold back with the ball [noise]\nAnd with that Daniel Davis is running with it now brings up a third and gold to go with the poor yard line and this could be a major stance for the tigers and this could be a huge momentum shift or once again if they're able to stop the McHenry bears full house back but it all upset I formation [noise] twin receivers\nTo the laughter tied into the lead handed off up the middle of the three yard line he stood out driven back no go the tigers hold on third down\nIt'll bring up a horse and goal\nThey go a really hard run right up the left\nHand side and that's led off into Levi jade de Williams the left guard plowing the way but it falls short of the first by about a two yards are shorter the goal I should say by about two yard they hurry did a line of scrimmage same type claim it looked like they were going to run before handed also no but the rollout\nAnd the passes there and they had a complete the tigers sold on fourth down Linder was there that but it just fits a play on or intend to receive retailer truck and with that the ball goes over on down to the tigers I like that\nWell that's a momentum changer for the tigers because they sure looking lethargic going off in\nA coming out when you think the but the spring to kick or to receive the the ball and the second half if that would be a big momentum changer especially going in a half like they did come out gay no yard penalty in the foot deep is comes up big consult takes over on their own\nTo yard line well it sounds really bad but they're taking over as saying is that going to be the two are the three of the one official standing at the to the yard marker appears to be at the three ... is very hard to tell will give them the two yard line I mean it could be a lot you think that's bad it could be a lot worse I mean the government could have scored\nOut of the gun and it all to Julius Howard busted plays hit and drop it the one that looked like catering was wanting to go to was laughing Julius kind of hesitated\nAnd then they wind up going just slightly to the right\nThat was not a well run play at all it was trying to go off the backs of\nConor hitch sort of random Wagner on that right inside but tiger is having trouble making the connection [noise] so no gain a second down intense [noise] goes out of the gun rolling out\nOffensively averaging three sixty two fur ball game but they're deep and seems to be the real problem they rank seventh and the district giving up four hundred and forty nine yards pregame however holding the consolidated tiger off into came in at the beginning of the

...\nGive us to Bradley Bradley tries right side of the line now left nothing doing and make Neal is going to come in and make the final hit on him and pulled it down to the turf\nBattle Neal was a hit if all lost on the play of about a yard and a half maybe two and this will bring up a third downplay meeting twelve for the first line of scrimmage was justice side of the thirty a yard line thirty seven yards\nLiar so if you get down to the twenty six was the first day interesting to know it seems like the only penetration to the ah [noise] but ... says getting in the middle of the field
