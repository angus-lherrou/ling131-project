I mean I don't know if that's going to start World War three but it certainly pushes the very very difficult spot\nAnd his jacket pointed out yes it could destabilize everything and you know I I really didn't you know pay attention all that much in the case until someone had said you should talk about this because of what it might mean and what ... what am I Do to force the president's hand I said well\nThis is obviously something once again this is provided by groups like gladly oh the deep state operatives they're all over the world and uh it's it's more than just taking down a president's thinking down in the entire country and that's what this is all about\nSo ah let's go to Peter Indiana Hi Peter and ground zero\nTake like what's up I\nI think he might be over thinking this a little bit I I I I Do like your deep state thought and everything but I think this is a plot by the hardliners and in Saudi Arabia and the Muslim Brotherhood will hobby is just get rid of Mohammed bits on law and I'm not sure that they're not in foods with a ... at the same time\nHow how does this affect or get ... get affect him why does it affect the president at the deep state thing you'd have to be because look if it's if it's\nAll about a Muslim fighting and fighting ... or whatever you want to talk about then you know then why did they kill the guy who who once wrote about al ... in a favorable way why why did they were\nThe words the body he may not be dead he's part of the Muslim\nHe's been dismembered that's what they say that's what they say but we haven't we haven't seen any cereal okay what what is this power with the Muslim Brotherhood that\nWell the Muslim Brotherhood who wants to retake back ... NBS or whatever he calls himself as well to wanting to normalize westernized\nWell if they want to do that they failed miserably what they've done now they put President Trump in a very precarious position he's like jak so he's been between a rock and a hard place if we decide to to push Saudi Arabia bill up our gas prices will you\nWill be in a world of hurt and not only that but we'll see our economy ...\nOr they could sacrifice their president Mohammad bin saw him on and get back in our good gracious well at the same to al\n... back in August so you really think that it's going to happen on do you think they're going to execute him\n[noise] I I Would think that the after he and ... and a lot of them in their\nHistory former remember Peter he's a reformer removed her former yes and that's where they don't like they don't want reform I don't buy it they want you don't buy it well\nI don't buy that he's a reformer at all I don't I don't buy it you know I mean look these guys wield a lot of power they will they they did is because they have all the the oil and they have all this they have all this stuff we basically been kissing their answers for a long time\nAnd we gave it to them after World War one and and and the thing is is that now they pulled something or that someone has pulled something in the deep state to make this happen\nAnd it's it I I kind of agree with jak it's there to make Donald Trump making stupid decision whenever he got down to be done and they'd be damned it'll be damned if he doesn't\nAnd I think Trump is alluded to something when he said today that rogue actors ... they may have been at\nI think really actors as do speak for deep state\n[noise] it it could be or be rogue actors within the Saudi Government they want to want to undermine been so long [noise] well\nI I Will just have to wait and see 'cause I Know that uh uh I think that Saudi Government a CNN has been alluding to the fact that Saudi government's been wanting to come forward and say that yes they killed him\nBut I mean I I just don't this is one of those situations Peter ... we just have to wait and see how it all plays out 'cause right now it's ... my my my feelings are that this is a deep state up a gladiator type operation where they had done this because it puts President Trump at a very bad position especially before the election\nAnd the fact that I said before and I said I think it's it on the ... Jones show I said that I think our next step is to destroy the economy and secure a war footing and actually that's our next phase so I mean this could do it\nLooking at I think we have to look at turkey here born in the in the shaky footing or two on his own with his ...\nDropping like Iraq right [noise] and he's got a to Z hardliners in Saudi Arabia yeah and and it's possible that this is a a a\nForm of a coup tests within Saudi Arabia that we build interest curved to ah serve to help a turkey get back in August ...\nWe'll see what happens here we'll see what happens right now I don't it doesn't look too good Peter thanks for your call thank you ... they get Tripoli except for three thirty seven hundred will be back\nIn time I mean mind [noise]\n\nLaw is not going on it's not happening but then you go okay well that can't happen but it is happening look at all the diversity or I mean like that's happening with the Arab by a little up or you got all these\nA fraction of the people that are just pitching a fit about everything and then the country if you look at things will be stabilized everywhere\nMoney we are being labeled ... all the countries all the countries that ah you know want to hold onto their sovereignty and their freedom or being destabilize it might the United states is a big ... that's when they want they want it done\nIn and look at our our ... our economy yell one hand there by it's like even Trump try and say oh we're doing great but then on the other hand you look at or losing jobs for some of these plants close and now we're losing fat or losing all these laws and\nAs long as the years is shutting down certainly a sound but we have a great economy and you know another thing I'll tell you this do you know how you judge there there are three ways you\nJudge economy of of words going one how much is a Big Mac to how much is it to go to a movie and three how much is the lottery worth tomorrow yep\nThat's how you join in the lottery the lottery is over or nearing a billion dollars the economy has gone to help these people wouldn't be buying that many lottery tickets it'll be the case that\nYou I mean that's what I'm seeing you know in in everybody's looking at the fact that all the\n... and all these people you know saying oh Trump's you know not doing this in in eight states not doing this but if you look at the way things are going it set up for basically like you say I kind of a a global\nSituation and I do believe the Trump I'm not saying he is the goal like I said the leader of that\nBut he has something to do with that I mean you look at when he was going through I guess said in the Republican nomination in ... that I mean everybody really thought he was a joke at first and then he is and now he's president and all the stuff\nProbably oh I see him as a joke I I was very I thought it was a contender I mean I I had I had my doubts about whether or not he wins but a ... year old I mean\nThat's what I'm getting at I mean you will not say a total joke joke but I'm just saying he he was not a contender in there really and then all of a sudden he's president now and they look at what he's saying he's actually doing it but I think part of it as far as the stabilizing all of the country and over\nAgain I don't think he's a no I don't think he's involved with the stabilizing the country the country was already\nHaving a ... have you on the street who are always no no no no no book storage please\nYou need to stop focusing on Donald Trump and you stop focusing on Hillary Clinton you need to go beyond that you need to go beyond where we started seeing this stuff happened after the nine eleven attacks like you need to start looking at the socialism was being pushed on the American people after that\nThe idea of the project or the new American Century the neo cons were pushing that issue of expansion in the middle east and all that and put that into perspective Donald Trump is probably fully aware\nOf just how fragile things are right now he's he's acting presidential at least he's trying to his\nWas appalling in it\nWell maybe maybe the ... baby doesn't understand he doesn't understand is who's in control I think he may think he's in control I think the American people who voted for him to be even control but I don't think he's in control\nI think the deep state has been ... and they're not going to let up but he's still fighting like hell because he won't go down without a fight because of his ego and that's fine but you these shows that he if you if you get angry enemy you bully him he bullies you three times as hard\nAnd people want that and leaders they want a leader who's willing to fight that and that's why they do it but it doesn't make it right it doesn't make it wrong it\nJust makes Donald Trump Donald Trump and it doesn't matter how much bullying you'll do in the inner how much money do in the end it we're screwed we're screwed and that's the point and and won't matter they're crumbling all those great wonderful things they're going to throw that all on them like slot Kobe getting\nThat he he you know you're like say you're thinking that he's the one that stinking everything's great but he's actually on that's helping each state has all this\nHow is the helping stabilize housing I don't even effective at night it'd be doing it\nLooked at the divisiveness in this country right\nNow ... through the divisiveness not Trump the media is doing that the media says Trump's visit draws on Trump's is\nOn the chest and go into all these little\nHe has made a little more wrong with him going to rallies I mean what more prominent horn rallies it I Would I'm getting\nHillary held rallies in really held rallies ... Brock Obama held rallies George Bush held rallies why what's the point\nThat you did not see all the problems with those rallies you did not see all the protests you did not see all of his\nYou know because they kept telling me how did you know that when George Bush went down or when he went down a ... I guess ... Pennsylvania Avenue the parade they have in Washington his\nCar would beg the whole time nobody saw that 'cause they kept the cameras on the fact that he was the ... the uh the limousines were being egg\nYeah I mean as I say though and you look at Trump's and everything's doing it's the whole situation that he's a stabilizing the whole I mean the world is\nNow the stabilization happened before the elections\nWell I'm not saying they that's how it started I mean that's how he got in there I mean all these stabilizing and I think what he is he's giving credit here smart he's taken advantage of the situation\nHe's he's given credit smart he's taking advantage of the situation to set everything else on nearby so worried about these elections come up that you know all of a sudden all Democrats can you know it'll throw him out of office no it doesn't matter who go in there\nI ... I think you drove through my friend and I think I think he's more clueless and George W. Bush was I think you\nKnow and again I don't I don't think so I think he's in everybody's getting credit I don't think so and I think he's\nGoing okay because he's already said one time he thinks he can be the president for life and it's a situation where that's what he said look for in this global situation there set him that it all that's doing it stabilized in our country and it\nI gotta say it'd be it'd be makes himself president definitely he's not gonna last Fifteen minutes after that\nWell but see that they're even that's part of the agenda I mean a thinking and and like I say I I I mean it's legal situation it's it's ... it I mean he's making millions and Amy as God somewhat\nHe's not making any money off of being president\nOh you'd be surprised\nNot only that he doesn't need it he doesn't he didn't take the\nSalary ... they didn't do their salary of it well even if\nIt's a joke compared to what he's making for all all of his interests and everything is okay what do you look at what a mate last year\nYeah he's a billionaire we knew he was a billion or we voted him in\nAnd look at what he made since we put in their\n... following his bank account I don't know what his name was he made maybe he's not doing their entire mainly is I mean\nHis family is going to make money anyway I mean this is the thing is they were all like look what he's done here look we've done here you know look at him look at what he is look what he does look I Would just stand there and he's oblivious he's oblivious he's he's oblivious I Can't get enough he's oblivion\nThat's what they said\nThat he's a delivery is George George oblivious\nHe just said how do you think he's got he's at he's a smart man that makes their body think he's\nA smart businessman and that's even arguable but what I'm saying is that the president I think he's clueless I mean you've got ... I think he's just doing what he was told\nNo yeah yeah I think you know I don't I think you have to work\nThere are people that are helping him in this situation\nTo directly meal with their directing him as\nAn artist there there there's some things he says no to because he is going by his conscience I think Trump goes by his conscious more more so than people think he does I think he goes by his conscience more so than people think you know and that makes him\nIt it it makes them effective as a person who can engender some sort of competence with the people and that's fine I mean I've been ... rock Obama had that same power\nThe only problem is is that Obama ... you started writing up laws in whims and things and continuing the the oppression and I think Trump has an exercise any of those things yet 'cause I don't know if we know we have what is it is disposal or if he does that mean supposedly chooses not to use them you realize you could jail reporters were lying about it\nIf you want to see how it\nShould but see that that the pitch but if he does that they're in right now would not be the time to do that\nRight now will not be the time to make any rash decision about Saudi Arabia but he's going to have to because he's being pressure to do it and then they know that we made the rounds with the gas pump we may see some problems with inflation of economy we may or may see some stuff go down and this is why I say if the deep state move it to the deep state movement\nA worldwide on world wide scale and analyze them in your in your ear think it's all you know give him no I don't get any it again it's against the United states\nIt's against it and it's a whole lot of different things and he's a part of that said no I don't buy it\nI don't buy the drums a part of it not because I like Trump I don't like Trump but I'm just saying I don't buy it\nBut he ... he", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "College Station", "day": "16"}
