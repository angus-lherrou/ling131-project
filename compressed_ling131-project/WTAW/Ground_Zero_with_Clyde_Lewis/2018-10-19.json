I mean that's amazing isn't it is it ... the matrix there's gotta be\nWe're getting to the meat and potatoes of everything right now because it's very easy to break the programming and it's only a matter of recognizing it\nAs a matter of recognizing how consciousness works in in of itself so as we said there's two types of consciousness on the board you have are Ghana consciousness which are are can be like into a world of Warcraft game with a player actually sitting there the computer and you have the non player character consciousness that are part of the game they were created within the game they were created within the matrix\nNow the organic consciousness can be overlaid with all these different programs um through traumas through a programming through the television this and that\nBut when you start to deconstruct all those layers and you start to ask yourself who am I before I came into this matrix I we're all infinite which I I think that that that's what organic consciousness all feels on one level or another\nWho were we before we we came into the matrix when we can reach down into that level and I call it the rock consciousness that's where the notes just comes out that's where the understanding comes out that's where the ability to be able to look at these programs and see them for what they are um actually starts to starts to come out\nSo first of all it's about recognizing how these programs work they are working through the airwaves but they're also working through what I term are cons um little entities in the background some people call him demons or the black magicians will call upon them so on and so forth but there are ... programs that are working in the background\nThese are cons what they do is they whisper all of these negative thoughts into your mind\nAnd they they have a direct link into the mind and the more that they're whispering into these ... into your mind then they start to be able to affect physical reality because now you're getting all of these stock program stop loops um and so on and so forth when you're being put into these data states when you're sitting there in front of the television and so on and so forth\nSo when you start to get these start loops if you just recognize wait a minute\nThis isn't really coming for me this is coming from some type of programming um that's been injected into my brain let me go deeper than that let me go beyond that what do I see when I take a step outside of the matrix or take a step outside of whatever situation that we're looking at whether it's a political situation of spiritual situation a day to day situation\nHow can I see this from a three hundred and sixty degree perspective once you do that and all of a sudden the programming breaks and when it does and you start to see the world for what it really is\nAnd you start seeing elements in the media or in the political atmosphere that are good some elements are bad you don't come from a place of left or right anymore instead you just come from a place of what is right and what is wrong and the way that I defined right or wrong it's very simple lighting darkness\nIt's natural law it's it does argue hurting somebody argue impeding upon somebody's freedom or are you a damaging somebody's property um if you take a look at the situations around us and you asked yourself does this piece of legislation there are about to pass\nIs that impeding upon freedom is that impeding upon life liberty you know these basic fundamental principles of freedom then you can take a look at the piece of legislation for example as what it is\nInstead of saying well my party says is and so I have to believe this are my party says that um so I have to believe that and then pretty soon realized that this whole divide between us has been systematically programs within the matrix to keep us fighting with each other while they continue to manifest all of these realities that they once\nBut really the power and lays inside each and every one of us to manifest our own reality\nAs I said before I have the CIA document in my hand called 'em and now it's just an assessment of gateway process and it shows you how to manifest the reality around you\nSo by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality what I always tell people as we look at the the huge mountain it's in front of us you know when the truth or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but that's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nIs just change ourselves but what we can do also as we can pick up a rock and move a single rock and then we can show somebody else how to move another rock and pretty soon that entire mountains starts to change that strong\nLittle by little you know I always used to be a slogan a you know getting the truth about one minute time and it it just seemed to me that that was that was spinning back then but\nNow it's the idea of breaking through this except that emotional biased and getting that out of the ways that we can get down to the bottom of what really is true that the dirty ugly truth\nBut it's supposed to set us free but I say hey you know what what you find out it'll pick you up in the in the process so you've got to be careful of what used to do what you think truth is and get rid of the confirmation bias is all part of the program and it's all part of exploiting the NBC and everyone ... six seven three thirty seven hundred will be back\nAnd he's looking for a big mess schooling or some sort of drug and eat and a meal has hidden in the book in his book ... the drug\nAnd the book is called ... civil recruiting simulation it's a book by John ... and basically he's talking about this he said you know their relationships between reality symbols numbers or how society looks at them and how they're used as ...\nAnd the thing with the ... the symbolism of cultures and media and constructing an understanding a shared existence that through the book is about it's about how they tried to create a shared existence in the collective there are programs would know the words the numbers the codes\nAnd if you can crack the codes and get the cheat sheet you'll be able to master a B the master of the game not be someone who's just in ...\nDid you know that the entire cast before they were even allowed to read the script if the matrix had to read that book first\nYeah it's an amazing book I've read it to its jumbled yard a eyes I recommend this book is another ground zero mosque street it's called ... and simulation it'll help you understand the matrix a hell of a lot more just like ah the ah the just the gamble book about myth power of myth also helps you understand Star Wars with a lot more\nTo go to a Jimmy Jimmy a Jew in California you're on ground zero go ahead\nHey ... what a great show tonight while and Christians ... thanks for letting us all behind the veil tonight\nI gotta say I'm I've been a listener for a long time but I think this is one of the most cogent discussions I've heard about the nature of reality especially a new guys abroad and the and PC to the category of\nA human existence now and I think to ... you may be talking about is is a humanity and another itself because you know through the through the hyper reality programming that we received through a\nFacebook and all I'm we're pretty much a reacting on emotional responses are based on whatever feed we're getting from the matrix\nAnd uh ... uh I really wanted to thank you guys for bringing a this conversation to the table on on ground zero and that is and I was wondering is there someplace where because I Know I I I heard about a video that you guys did I'm over in Egypt earlier in the show\nAnd I was wondering is there a place where we can see the videos or is there someplace where we can get a hold of you um you know maybe you guys have a website or something\nYeah absolutely we're working on a film called re sending the matrix Iowa ... in the great pyramid which details are journey into Egypt\nI'm working with this sacred shut Monica um brew that uh we actually had four hours in the ... some of the great pyramid completely alone we just a minute or hour there when deep deep deep into trans\nAnd um you can get that film at resetting the matrix dot com\nUm there were some remarkable things that happened on that journey and it was all live streamed which was incredible and of course um we have a radio station CF are alive dot com or you can listen to beyond the veil as well and you choose dot com slash beyond the veil thank you very much for asking that\nYou know things you damaging thank you ... ... ... I wanted to ask you sure on on this post modern as of this this term hyper reality of the book that you just\nBrought up is also I'm highly this the psychology and philosophy behind this or that book because I think one of the main scenes in the matrix that a lot of people overlook is the scene where\nUm the ... goes ignorance is bliss ... you know he saw behind the curtain he got behind the scenes he went on a facade he's he realized he was an eating steak\nIs really just eating gray slot and eventually he got sick eating ... and he wanted to go back into the simulation yeah just pretend that he was eating that steak even though he knew it was gray slides\nBecause what a ... says in the end we prefer the simulation or the real and that's what we are doing now we're ... we're looking at the simulation\nAnd most people are believing the simulation they believe what they're told that he started speaking the script and people started getting script fatiguing eventually it's going to destroy us because no one is going to know the truth in reality they're just going to prefer the simulation that's why sex box exist\n... virtual reality sex exist that's why you're finding sympathetic I people would rather be sympathetic gay either with human beings is because we prefer the simulation because they can control the simulation reality or whatever it is we are doing in the matrix is not good enough after program themselves outside to become in PCs\nCan I read one sentence listen to this hyper reality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement and steady instead opting for artificial simulation right an endless reproductions\nRight you know exactly right and that's another guard is\nHitting a you've got the hardest hitting show on the air ... you are the alternative the alternative thanks for letting me call and you guys great show\nYou appreciate that very much is very good thank you so much for that kind of in Texas you run with Christians Riggio go ahead\n[noise] um I had actually yeah I wasn't listening from the very beginning so I just came in with your thoughts about the the magic and the person sending the message about it and I was curious about that so I looked it up at one point and basically I was from like the the random\nSo let's say that at one point and basically I was from like the the random number generated a fortune when you post and people would call out like what the end you know you got\nRepeating numbers that was supposed to be significant ... and so people with those names and they would call out like what they're what what they thought the end of the secrets and if they were right it was that as much as it then\nThe tape a mean was already I mean you know used and then they used it and then Donald Trump was getting elected right and they thought eat almost like a medium\nWell yeah well they another affected me ... for the church the sub genius\nYou ever seen that it's a guy smoking a pipe you was taken from an ad and they use it as a as a a a representation of their religion\nAlbert II Newman was from a to Z ad from the Nineteen twenties and he became the agriculture mascot or whatever you want to call it a mad magazine so yes sometimes means can be hijacked sometimes they can be used for other purposes\nThis one seems to be this NBC one seems to be very original but it does a very look uncannily like a monkey was among the was would you be\nAnnounced chemical magical ... or at least a representation of such\nAs well and when I was ...
