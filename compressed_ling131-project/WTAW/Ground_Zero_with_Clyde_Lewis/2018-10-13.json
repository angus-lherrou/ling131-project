and that's never going to work out good for anybody it isn't nice skate on the plays the squeezes out what about five yards or so\nAbout five yard no that's more than that that's about eight yards on the play inside the twenty five down to the twenty four\nSecond down seven needed for the first foreign Lamar consolidated one running back maybe Williams gets it right up the got again\nFollowing his lead blockers inside the Fifteen yard line and he is down to that point but not before he hammers inside the red zone at another first down thanks to the good tough running or the one hundred and Ninety five pound running back and save it Williams I'm what I'm saying you can specimen he is a tougher on her and when you need three or four you can do that all night\nYou know thank goodness issue came off so now he's got to come out of the ball game for a player too and uh\nWith the little more consolidated busting some of the ball and the consultants team we don't need this big losses bogus\nJonathan McGrath will come in and lived up in a slot to the rise of running back ... castle Barry Castle Barry gets the call he's hit as he crosses the line of scrimmage at the heart to yard gain on that one it'll bring up a second down at about eight tigers had a bit of a blood coming it will Harris was all over him do coming in from defensive and nice read on the Florida will\nDoes was telling Williams also in the ...\nSecond down eight line of scrimmage Thirteen yard line for Lamar moving it left or right deep and tiger territory trailing by seven to eight em consolidated\nI'm second down running back will remain the undead castle berry they throw far side competent yard line picks up a block east pancake good about that but it'll be shorter the ...\nFirst I call it the tin yard line picks up a block each pancake good about seven or eight shorter the first flight to so now the tigers who last week turned it over to Montgomery at the two yard line an elder from storing\nAre gonna have to really tightened up here because now it is a third down three with the line of scrimmage up to Thirteen yard line and I get the feeling\nOf all the extra points have been good you may see a field goal by regular papers that don't make it but I think this is for\nDown territory especially if saving William sort of come back yeah they will leave castle Barry enough to have back on third down quarterback keeper Harris as a whole it's a five yard line and I think he's got to get the first inside the five should\nBe a first and goal to go with the ... ... nothing fancy about that camera regrets and Jim ... are still a whole to now they made their move on the right side and you didn't need much there's a lot of people in that side of the line Josh Ellison comes

I haven't\nSeen anything yet to convince is be we went to the moon only TV [noise]\nAnd believe me they do a lot of things with TV\nAnd a lot of things they did was be fooled people do a lot of things on the movies that do that is why first ban is in theaters [noise] as they can make it and they can make it back then to\nRead this or this little space race a little more interesting and you know I I just would say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge or race than I Am compared to like the fat kid\nGoing up to the the ... guy saying hey I'm going to I'm going I'm going to run a race with you and I'm going to beat you\nAnd then in the ... and the and the the guy must going to say OK guy give it a chance and so one day the guy wakes up and says wait a minute he ... he won the race how did he do that and that's how I think Russia saw this thinking we were before we were more successful in the United states was and now they're doing this how they do it how would they get Ben on the moon impossible\nYeah genius does it get bluff everybody went down\nYou know if ... if it was a good ... was genius Michael thank you for the college true it was a genius if that's if that's the case go to Doug in Pennsylvania Hi Doug your own ground zero\nAnd you don't find good show as usual thank you\nYeah I have a hard time believing the whole thing I mean the technology that can engage label took a car up there with him in road around yeah [laughter] yeah I Know it just uh the money that it would it take to get there I was sure would have been a lot cheaper to fake it\nAnd I think that's why we're not going now because you get out there and here there's money there is you know equipment parts and stop playing there\nWas that was the thing I remember I remember when we went to the moon is really cool and they started talking about the shuttle program\nAnd I thought to myself well why is the shuttle so so important and it doesn't make any sense to me I thought he was the shuttle came off to me like a bus it's like hey we're going to drive a bus around the earth for a couple of orbits and then we're gonna we're just going to drop it like a rock through the atmosphere and I always thought to myself ... that's pretty lame\nYou know we went to the moon I mean why is this such a big deal and I and to this day I Can't have anybody tell me why they show it was such a big deal it just\nIt wasn't a big deal it was like a a space plane big deal\nIt would have been a big deal if they would have used it to build something like a some sort of space ship to travel our solar system or something but\nYeah I Would have been nice if they use it to build something in space but got nowhere near the moon you go to somebody you say to them well you know how far does the space shuttle go into space they wouldn't know they didn't know that when like three hundred and foreign miles in space they didn't know that and then when you say well how far away as the moon they don't know that two hundred and fifty two hundred thirty no way that\nYou know about that that was my dog\nWell we're going to hear da da da\n\nDa da da da da da da da da da da Silva\n... dog [laughter] I Can't take care of by the by\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven I was going to Kevin in Ohio Hi Kevin you're on ground zero\nThick cloud based out of this lesson to thank you thank you or\nI Can't prove to that we're all of them are\nUh I Can't say that this is who was supposed to have been on\nWho the Iran a dad was an air force is gr force and here\nAre near uh thirty out here they are so we're on a trip out west and we spent some time with us\nThey've got ... who was on a couple of missions and was a supposedly walked on them into a on a policy and you have to stay in a mission ... uh yeah I Can't prove they did or not because I've been there myself at\nSt period and then say hey\nWhat did did you talk with him about it\nSo yeah yeah quite a bit\nYeah I remember in his son was about ... it's aimed at the time we were there and a kind of felt bad for him because it seems it ... when your dad than into space and then on the ... ... what do you do [laughter] ...
