it's a\nIt's based on a few you know mitigating facts is based on a few things okay but if you say I have a conspiracy I have I have put together the names and I put together the ideas I began to the ideology behind the conspiracy\nAnd\nIt's amazing way of looking at how we are headed and which direction were had ... on our current trajectory our nation's\nDynamic is going away completely and I think people know that the dynamic of what America is and what it's supposed to be has gone away\nDo nights ago I called my show new justice no peace and attempted to point out\nTraditional way we think of civil war in this country is crowding the fact that we are already in one and and and well no one will attribute school shootings that beat the gate shootings Las Vegas the tax exempt\nOn and then and well no one will attribute school shootings that pizza gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of a civil war in progress\nOur leaders both left and right now ... now that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the November midterm election\nAnd this isn't me you know ... up the the emotion\nOkay 'cause I was putting so I put something up on my Facebook page oh yeah I put up with Hillary Clinton said it is no there no more time to be civil I put that up on my on my side because what that is that prompted in New York Post to put up civil war\nOn their headline\nSo yesterday the headline on the New York post civil war and I talked about civil war the night before the post posted their civil war headline so and and they were pointing to what Hillary Clinton said the Christian on the poor CNN when she was interviewing her and she said something to the fact that\nUm you know we don't have to be civil to a government that doesn't respect us\nOkay so but the Trump of course President Trump and warned that there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections you stated that the rights of Americans were under threat from quote violent people and quote now of course\nThis type of rhetoric is be expected because the media paint him as a leader who advocate violence I'm not saying this is an excuse and I wish I didn't have to practice everything or do foot noting in order to make a point but this is what we have been forced to do\nYou see the arguments are such that they cut deep both ways the media pays the president's threatened violence as wishful thinking on the president's part is if they know as a fact\nThat this is what he wants to be able to magnify it in order to make him the poster child for his dream right wing views however the extremism became even more intense\nAfter CNN's Christie on on the poor sat down\nFor an interview with Hillary Clinton Clinton told everyone watching that the time of civility is over she says you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about it\nHe said that's why I Believe that we are fortunate enough to win back the White House and Senate that's when civility can start again so there you have it\nA declaration of civil war in a license for violent see the motive of course he's getting what you want by any means necessary not that the vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and ... and the instability you could create the change the direction of the votes\nSo Donald Trump says there will be by there will be violence if the Republicans lose Hillary Clinton says no civility until we win\nNow that doesn't sound like Cold War I don't know what does okay\nAnd and I mean the New York post agreed with me yesterday and what is most disconcerting is while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected they failed to expound upon the comments that Hillary Clinton made no one not even an interviewer stopping asked her\nIf she was saying could be considered reckless or fueling the fire it was already started consequences be damned a civil war has to happen in order to take over the Senate\nThat's what that's what I got from both of them\nFrom says violence if we lose Hillary Clinton says violence until we win\nNow what should we do what should we do how are we supposed to vote either way we're screwed right he is a quagmire\nThis this this is a quagmire this we are we have two leaders okay\nAnd and Hillary Clinton is the leader I don't care what you say she's the leader of a group of people ... she's the leader of the resistance OK she says we will not be civil until we when Trump says if you when they are they the Republicans won't be so\n... we're at war with ourselves\nAnd the mob namely those who have been attacking politicians namely\nThose who've been you know creating the road road blocks okay or those who have been pounding on the doors of Congress during the cabin on hearing all of this mob\nMentality is is right now being contain but one day it won't be contained K. and one day the mob will rule if the mob isn't ruling all are already and you have two people that should know better\nBecause what they're doing now is they're meddling in our\nOwn election this is meddling OK Hillary Clinton is meddling Donald Trump is meddling they're both meddling\nAnd they're giving threats of violence if it doesn't go their way [noise]\nThis is what is terrifying okay this is why I say civil war [noise]\nYou can't convince me otherwise I been in the middle of as I see it I feel it and it's not going to the people aren't going to die yet there's no charging for your guns none of that [noise]\nThese are the words that start War Within countries which are believed six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA fix every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero we'll be back [noise]\nSocial your comment on that merits language and secondly anyway even a ... I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is just try to get back to some civility and just try to make it even if we have to go disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see a return to civility lessening Tijuana now there are working out our differences that are not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now [noise]\nWhen the Republican Senate denied\nThe right at President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland a heard\nI think anything that they stole a justice on the line\nI think they did I mean to keep a Supreme Court said open for a year or to deny it distinguishes Europe they couldn't vote even down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reason or we're not going to vote for him but no they don't wild\nAnd that was such a breach a ton of Africa and the constitutional responsibility of\nThe Senate to advise and can count on nomination [noise] that you cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nHouse hand or the panel that Clinton that lady can start again that\nSort of civility can start again is when we get this then\nOtherwise the time for civility is over but you notice how a Christian of CNN Christian on divorce ed or on the board said that\nUh did you notice the mirroring of of what's being said here this is a left wing conspiracy as opposed to what Hillary set about a vast right wing conspiracy\nSo okay so let's just eliminate for the moment the idea of a theory roads Hillary's theory or whether it's Kellyanne Conway theory is a mirroring of time and it is a conspiracy\nBut who is behind the conspiracy who is joining up the emotion in Syria\nTo put us into this moment in time where extremism is even more intense\nWhere we have to gin up the extremism and get everybody angry to everybody you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you\nCare about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\n\n[noise] see I see that as a declaration of civil war it's a license for violence\nAnd the motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary and that is what it is you know consequences be damned you know this is what we want to this is what we need this is what we get\nAnd it has to happen in order for us to take over the Senate\nSo her claim\nThat civility can return with the Democrats have power is the mission that something is up if Donald Trump is saying well if we don't win there will be violence than he knows just exactly what happened\nRecords the mainstream media will continue to expose or at least exploited for Donald Trump is saying because they want that\nTo be used against them if and\nWhen violence breaks out\nAt the election and we've been talking about the final blow for some time\nAnd maybe this is it maybe we're waiting for that happening in November maybe we're having later on but the response is what shows me the response to way Hillary Clinton had to say I mean the New York post headline yesterday declared civil war\nAnd published a number of articles pointing out the silliness of the country and civil war over the president is they have and a woman that resent the fact that she lost to a gym said running for the presidency\nAnd all of the resentment of those who oppose her\nNow if you're one of the unfortunate wants to go to Facebook in reading your spleen on the matter you were either shadow band\nOr you were one of the unlucky ones it with an algorithm stick tonight I'm being jammed so you know those are you there are listening and you're hearing the jamming I Know when I'm getting mean Facebook said\nThat today they purged over eight hundred US publishers and accounts\nFor what they say was flooding users with politically oriented content that violated the company's spam policy\n\nNow the timing couldn't have been more obvious in my opinion and they're certainly wasn't up to swell of criticism against Hillary Clinton Facebook of course and I think that they utilize their thought bullies or the thought police algorithms to remove any and all speech that would treat any bad press for the former secretary of state\nFacebook said it was removing the publishers and accounts not because of the type of content they posted\n\nBut because of the behaviors they engaged in including ... Facebook groups with identical pieces of content and using fake profiles not not not only did they removed sites that we're focusing on the comments of Clinton\nBut they did so before the midterm elections\nOne of the pages nation in distress pitched itself is the first online publication to endorse president Donald Trump founded in twenty twelve mass more than three point two million lives in over three million followers according to a Washington Post review on Thursday\n\nIn recent posting photos to criticize journalist for failing to report on Trump's approach to China and shared linked to a story that are called representative Maxine Waters demented\nThe page affiliated itself with a website called America's freedom fighters which appeared to pursue its own content and duplicate press releases run by others about violent crimes in gun rights all alongside a sidebar of ads\n\nSo that was the response at least from what I can gather that Facebook decided they want to remove eight hundred pages there was another um\nAnother page called ... press had more than seven hundred thousand followers and posted ...
