town but we're the only one that's locally owned and operated WG a W College Station Bryan\nI'm by Louis [noise]\n\n\nSo\nMale [noise] we've already you know we talked about bail many times the connections to the underworld [noise] and um [noise] it's always easy\nTo develop\nNotion that a lot of what's happening behind the scenes as cleverly obscured in some moments the open conspiracy of obvious but those were the planners in control of the world are driven by a cult relationships were powers and principalities that divide explanation we can call it\n... and control the world are driven by a cult relationships with powers and principalities that divide explanation if we can call it some sort of intrusion whether it\nBe a well in this case uh see panic infiltration I'm I'm sure there are plenty of people out there listening you would say well sure clients you you you see the devil and everything but you know you cannot fire even argue against the notion\nThat we are up against an intergenerational pathological governance by powerful individuals that certainly pulls possess what would be the knowledge in the information\nThat is used and also the blood rights and the sacrifices and and and the tools necessary\nDo will power at the expense of their fellow man\n\nWe could argue that what we're seeing is some a cold driven body of leadership that has an obligation as someone or some thing they can be seen as hauntingly identical to whatever demonic devil is short or or say panic covering or coal you even dream up\nI mean there's some sort of synergism\nWhich is basically a term meaning that there's a joint rule\n\nA joint rule of some kind of dark synergism\n... and beyond the general definition of trying to tell you send our kids have been synergy\nHad been used to denote different political processes in various contexts increasingly germs have been used to know ruled by secret elite sort of synergy that may be in power\nHas this alliance and Indian and it's not necessarily those associated with the president is not necessarily those associated with Congress\nNot necessarily those associated with anybody we're seeing on TV because it's talking to us about\nThe rulings talking to was about the scandals I mean they're just basically puppets that are answering to delete priesthood and some claimed that they are the ...\nAnd unfortunately the word ... brings everything with wide brush and so it's impossible to pinpoint just who may be responsible and who's pulling the strings here but someone\nWho claimed that this is our age put that bail arch at the Washington DC mall and they did just that day before the hearings took place well you up you know if I Want to be so bold as to identify some say panic alliance\nThey basically would somehow influencing the rulers of the world we can say well it's a little bit naughty plot\n\nAnd we could identify it as some ancient devotion to the God of fortresses because the Saturn the cult of bail I mean look the gods from the sky the gods of air bail is the God of a of the sky Baylor's or read all of these established connections with bail\n... we we now have to take into consideration there's there's a curious parallel between this and other false God's worshipped in earlier times it was when both\nThe ancient people's turned away from the upper hand of God and went for some of these a pagan following a you know God's through the air\nAnd a lot of uh you know a religious privacy deals with\nAllowing for this anti Christ philosophy to enter into many of the established governments religions what have you creating minions that will that will ah do the bidding of these ... these powers\nAnd so the anti Christ with the anti Christ power with his Dark Tower this cancer\nWill grow\nAnd and what it will do is it will grant certain people that lead us the ability to work in tandem\nWith this dark sinister state\nAnd I talked about the dark stayed a while ago but the idea is to divide up the areas of the earth\nSo that\nThese beings or whatever they may be the confidence drinks sure I've been talking about\nThey can take over and we give them honor\nAnd that is the goal\nAnd all of these groups [noise]\nAll of these groups focus and then give their devotion to give their heart and soul to death and confusion and despair [noise]\nAnd so everything going on in Washington right now surrounding the arch is doing just that [noise] and those who are in power [noise] those were making the decisions those who are saying this is this and that is that our grading the division of the people creating such an anger such a division [noise]\nBut who knows what comes next [noise] the only one who truly does\n[noise] the confidence strict stir with confidence troops do we know is the devil and those who are in his employ Tripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred which Tripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nWar between God and the devil in the future is this is this some sort of eschatology on a charade or play or some melodramatic play that they want to play out that the revelation of the Methodist what is going on I mean we're wired for this right\nAnd show to regular observers that don't know anything about the background of the arch\nThey'd say well what's the big deal\nWhen I say well look at the coincidence look at the coincidence\nAs to the arch of bail erected in Washington DC the day before they decide to go and have the testimony between Ford and Kavanaugh\nIn what the testimony represent and what Kavanaugh represents as chief justice when he's confirmed\nThinking about what it all mean\nOn September twenty seven the testimony delivered by Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Judiciary committee took a turn that was unexpected and quite perverse\nSheldon Whitehouse the senator from Rhode Island used a portion it means a lot of questioning time to ask the Supreme Court nominee about the definition of the devil's triangle\nOn there were so many things you could ask you about but he decided to ask about the devil's triangle and for most Americans who came of age in the same years is Brett Kavanaugh well you may not know where that term means but\n[noise] you know barring sounding a little crude and in the city is I'm going to tell you it's a slang term for a three seminars you try\nTo Kevin I told the committee that is that British the term was different devil's triangle he said was merely a drinking game three glasses in and try and go he said he said it's like playing quarters\nHowever the devil's triangle is often referred to a sexual threes them or two men have sex with a woman and not touch one another as otherwise you'll be considered homosexual be considered gay\nSo that what the definition is whether it's\nPersonalized my cabinet I mean something totally different or probably repeated by Sheldon Whitehouse\nThe devil was honored in a way that somehow describes who is in control of the powers of Washington DC the power of bail the God of sex the God of man and the guy to power and the God of child sacrifice that God a dead babies the God of abortion\n\nAnd what they aren't you bail represents everything that the saga for Kavanaugh situations revealing specifically accusations of sexual perversion the fight for power and the cause against child sacrifice in the form of abortion\nIn the end debate over whether or not\nConfirmed bread cabinet boils down to the issue of sexual misconduct rape abortion\nAnd how his confirmation in the Senate is going to have a tremendous impact\nOr have tremendous implications for the future of our country groups like Planned Parenthood for example say the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as a potential threat to what they called reproductive freedom however the focus on Kavanaugh's confirmation has been primarily on the multiple sexual misconduct allegations\nGoing back to his high school but remember if Kavanaugh is confirmed you'll have a lot to say about abortion you'll have a lot to say about what the future holds for overweight now is just a coincidence\nThe arch of bail represents all of those things I talked about in more they arrested in Washington DC just before one of the biggest\nThe biggest hearings ever to decide the fate of our country there was no coincidence here no coincidence at all I Believe there are darker forces at play here\n\nAnd you will see when the end result happens how dark it will get\n\nGood at Bradley and Pennsylvania Hi Bradley you're on ground zero\nHey ask if you think that the same on organizing this archer avail is the same group that's obsessed with it and the government\nLike this so what do I want to say let's have states like a dark is the same that's obsessed with putting nine eleven out there it's like like what that emergency alert learn presidential or the other day\nWell I Would say that uh yeah I mean look the same people\nThat are behind all this the same people to give advice we can you know and and people like Carlos from California's you'd call it an eye and give his speech about the ... 'cause this is pretty much in my opinion how has the ... written all over it OK people in these\nI guess you'd call them secret societal say panic groups within our government within a places of power they know what these symbols mean to people and even though consciously you know people say oh it's just an arch no big deal but subconsciously we're wired\nFor all of this we're wired was symbolic ...\nAnd ah there was a study that was done again to prove that you know cellular a generational cellular hand off from generation to generation generation\nThat trauma and certain things are in our cells that triggers certain parts of means subconsciously to the body so when you're dealing with something when you're dealing with a symbol that symbolizes everything that I've talked about in everything is being talked about\nAt the for Kavanaugh hearings you have to take that into consideration some sort of say panic power ploy\nIn Washington D. C. and it's being done for a reason it's being done is a beacon to draw in those principalities from the air the bail is or isn't the bails him to lose the present always and all the symbolism comes together\nAnd it it goes beyond cabin on it goes beyond forward believe it or not they need it and I'll get into that later but see this is the beginning and the end is going to be dark obviously going to be dark because he was placed there to do guaranteed a dark ending\nBut you think that looking at the origin of how the arch fail if he was he wrecked it terrorism don't you think that's a tale itself\nWell yeah I mean you know when you look at something that ah was first destroyed with what it was basically a temple dedicated to the war on God and then it's destroyed and then\nThey look at it as they destroyed this monument we shall redirected and we will put on it but it's about peace and freedom and now it's never about peace and freedom regardless of who tore it down it was a symbol of what I said it was\nIt's a symbol of bail the horn God child sacrifice sexual perversion all of these things that are being talked about in Washington DC today and all the things will be ruled upon by the FBI and by the Senate when they make their vote\nYeah [noise] or if that was all I got a\nThing or anything he'd rather just go to Jean in Michigan Hi junior on ground zero\nCry sharing a carry on K still hold on for quite a long list I stayed out all the ads I kinda like state or fail out on top of the opposite but\nOh look at my college students are now on top but there is no absolute\nThe church it ad ... and ... I Believe is to my black churches so I'm really makes me think that in the meantime alive we'll go to the to the kids will be considered lie and say that when you\nKnow the area you're innocent and guilty until proven innocent now the other way around right\nWell and I also think about that scripture and due to Rami if you\nYou really think about it we're talking about any any time and civilization or a group it turns on his morality\nHas no promise no problem and so when morality is turned about and we start you know we start taking the the the I guess the orders from the competence stricter which is what I called\nThe devil is the confidence stricter when we're just starting to take our orders from the darker powers and the darker powers or a play they leave their symbols and signs everywhere and if you pick up on those symbols and science and you'll be well aware of what's to come and that's why I say repair for anything because for the for the short time but this has been happening\nI've noticed certain patterns I didn't talk about because I felt it was appropriate to talk about them because of of some of the things I picked up on\nAnd so that's what I'm delivering to to not you can take it for what it's worth\nBut trust me with all these are powers would play as I say prepared for anything\nBut yeah well I agree with you and let's say interesting to hear Saturday Night thank you\nThank you thank you Jane and it and you know and and this is in fear mongering this is pay attention because you know a talk show host talking like this people will think he's crazy and I don't care if you think I'm Crazy\nYou know I just have a lot of knowledge about the cold and this has got the cold written all over it certainly has to be worried about the future of this country because of what you know symbolizes they're actually\nSome money the power of bail to return again in that power is what ... is an editor pies and directs the anti Christ in our midst\nRed peppers new temples\nThe leaders Supreme\nHis infertile Madison [noise]\nFor boys six to three thirty seven hundred\nAs Tripoli six seven three three seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero it will be back [noise]\n", "station": "WTAW", "city": "College Station"}
