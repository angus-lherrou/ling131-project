final salute to these American heroes who perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign\nAnd Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and send it but this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans perished over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you ... said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more of those on the ground and the air and on the the I mean this is this is you know why we fight or to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties and it you know this is you know in addition to this\nA comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to\nA flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east so this isn't just a one off for her uh this is the pattern she advocated is shut down Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that this was common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited\nTo Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\n... absolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in our internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer top recruit for them to try to flip the Senate majority\nWe knew about her radical cats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks you're right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day\nBut unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another and social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have a ... a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not Sunni and unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played it costs us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now and she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com because we really do need to help to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they're aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten too good to know you in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think you'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but um that's happened more than a loan on her\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defense\nOr fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not so it\nWas a very you know that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American\nSoldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case ah I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh luckily we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make sure that our values were ... were set up for it yeah\nWell I really wish both on the way the president a new one here I'm a bit more to making Dolly if you're not paying attention to this race in\nArizona you need to pay attention first in cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha McSally doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose the torture as well\nI see where the line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a ... or getting radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best plan for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely with President Trump a it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to\nSecure our border and close the loop holes that the cartels are taken advantage of it has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in and ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now\nAll they do have been down there many times\nRedo yeah they're released into the interior of and I think sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recall\nFound in five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded and this is not Czech president John Fong if the Democrats for obstructing a closing loopholes and securing the border and the president as frustrated adding I and you need to use everything he's got to cook it to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then use the word building and funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes there\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell it's on I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on a house bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being next construed either Democrat they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people in that family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice and fourteen ... no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now is creating conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that and and towards something that gets more choice people\nMore flexibility at the state level of them are free market get the federal government you know to not be doing that one size fits all top down penalty packages mandate it's been cold\nAnd so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ing that vote I I voted to protect people with preexisting condition oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country\nAnd an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate\nThat'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier\nGoing up against the very radical leftists in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much ah Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race far and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks hon appreciate you signing a flashlight on that in an advocacy and if people want to how they can go to Nick Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and help and donations that we can win this thing and some I\nThink you rod is in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you ride\nA yes or a resolution on your show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the person that\nThat actually a presented when he was on trial is okay and the reason why my concerns is is because magic closed is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done it can ... they want us out of the transparency and so we've given transparent shaped like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever President Trump actually nominates they've already got a team investigating that specific person do attack on a smear campaign\nWell that's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that one oh one one or two one oh three one oh five one oh nine that this is it you know and you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats now are trying to urge caution on blue wave and temper expectations", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "College Station", "day": "22"}
