Gingrich is with us eight hundred nine foot one Sean has a number will in Palm Beach Florida Today\nI Want to go to this issue of this this reporter this guy with the Washington Post today or is not an American citizen\nLived for a long time in Saudi Arabia and it looks like he walked into the Saudi count council a in\nA counselor in in Istanbul and it looks like he was murdered now Mike Pompeo is asking the president to give the Saudis a couple of days they say they're going to get to the bottom of it but I don't really have any doubt that this guy was murdered and murdered by the Saudis and I doubt it happened without\nThe crown prince and other top people in Saudi Arabia knowing if that's the case\nYou know I Know Democrats want to pressure Donald Trump into doing whatever they want to do and making this the biggest litmus test but let me remind people\nThat Hillary Clinton in the Clinton Foundation took millions from the Saudis she never brought up their horrific treatment of women killing gays and lesbians she never brought up one time the persecution of Christians and Jews in Saudi Arabia\nUm and the same would go for a look at how they treated Benghazi but with that said we already know the double standard exist what are you what do you think\nThat's why I think I mean I think first of all that the president is right to be cautious\nOr do you indicate clearly that we don't necessarily know all the things that are going on in that I I think there will be very foolish\nFor us to a break a relationship with Saudi Arabia which is the key to containing Iran a but but I think we have to get to the bottom of it let me also point out to ... oh I'm just now working on a novel for next year called collusion in which the Russians\nAre decide they want to push in the U.S Senate or\nIf I were writing a novel about a Saudi journalist being killed and\nThe circumstances are just strange that that they're going to kill him in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul knowing that the Turkish intelligence services monitor them all the time they're going to do it with a team of Fifteen people um\nIt's almost like if they did do it and I'm not saying they didn't I mean clearly something terrible happened and and clearly\nInvade them do it on their sloppy and stupid and you know ... ... it's unbelievable the position they put any of their allies and you're right we have this on President alliance against the Iranian had Gemini with the Saudis Israelis\nEmirates Jordanians and Egyptians and it you know now that creates massive complications\nWell in but if you look at it you know we've said pretty clearly we're not going to tolerate the Russians poisoning people in Great Britain and she led to very specific sanctions\nOr I couldn't imagine a circumstance where if we do in fact decide that the evidence is overwhelming under the Saudis have the least promised secretary of state compel that they're going to give him the fool reports now again or they may well be lying but\nIf in the end we discovered that there are key people in Saudi Arabia and all I suspect it will be sanctions but the difference is one thing to have sanctions it's another thing you know to go wild and break up the the alliance and the relationship and the Israelis have been very clear\nThat they regard Saudi Arabia as such an important a defense against Iran or do they have urged us to be very careful and this process\nWe got to go but um this is the speaker uh it does complicate things but people do remember that our arch enemy a but a line with U.S Russia the former Soviet Union to beat Nazi has a\nContract and I think sometimes you just said you know we have taken steps against Russia in concert with the British\nOver killing ... trying to poison several people but we didn't we didn't go ... I think we may have to take significant steps ear and sanctioned some people and blocks and people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly are the crown prince had better clean this up or he will not be allowed back in the U.S for a long time\nI missed the speaker thank you for being with us we got to take a break by David shown and Carter Page will join us as the deep state gate gets a little deeper eh my buddies they do see we're going to get a lot of your calls and we have the other news of the day and what do we do about the caravan Nineteen days out of election day\nWe're in Palm Beach Florida Rush Limbaugh tonight for the full hour on Hannity as we continue\nOn the street because they were in a sanctuary city now the sanctuary state of California\nWith a with a sanctuary state free health care for all legal or illegal candidate Gavin Newsom out there in California you know talk about ...

Mexico to stop this onslaught and if I may have to do so I won't call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they won't open borders that existing week laws\nOf salt in our country by Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and leaders are doing little to stop the flow of people including many criminals from entering the United states through Mexico in his third Tweedy emphasize the importance of the places on stopping the migrants\nFrom ever entering the country said the assault on our country and our southern border including the criminal elements drugs pouring in is far more important to me as president than trade or the new trade agreement that he has with Mexico and Canada hopefully Mexico\nWill stop this onslaught at their northern border is that all Democrats fault per week laws have been trying to fix it now for a long time\nRight eight hundred nine four one Sean is our toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program Dan is in Michigan Dan Hi how are you welcome to beautiful Palm Beach where here Rush Limbaugh for the full hour on Hannity tonight what's going on Dan how are you\nA ... a um oh I Want to just go back to those documents that that are not what the inspector general you know the final core documents that a couple of weeks ago Trump order to be declassified right right okay [noise] and then Rosenstein came over the White House immediately\nAnd I didn't go over from what I understand there was a phone call\nOkay but I Want to paraphrase what Rosa saying basically I'm a I'm going to truthfully point and what was the same basic called him up\nAnd said look this president myself and my buddies are trying to impeach you put you in jail\nIf you release these documents is going to prevent us from impeaching your your tail and put you in jail and it's probably going to explode and face and you aren't going to be a free man so which do not released the because we still working to subvert your presidency\nAnd then after Sean after the phone call Trump find out how to do all this stuff about Rosenstein and the stuff that was after the phone call\nWhy wouldn't Trump realize you're trying to impeach them put them in jail college inspector general say get that to the White House sit around the oval office in these two things released arrest\nFrom my understanding is there being extra super careful that the president still committed to the classification\nOf releasing the the unwritten ... acted visor wants these are the main things we need we need the Pfizer warrant applications want we need the gang of eight material to\nWe need what's known as the thrill twos or the reports Bruce or especially with his contacts with Christopher Steele because we already know because of some of the leaks and communications that Christopher Steele\nThey already know because there's some of the leaks in communications that Christopher Steele who under oath and under threat of perjury in Great Britain and in in Iraq and tore even he couldn't stand by his own bony fake Russian dot CA that he was paid for\nYou know you've got all these people now that now the orders and want to talk or Glenn Simpson pleading the fifth Rod Rosenstein not only not turning over documents is time to talk to the wall Street Journal but no time to talk to a the members of Congress and hand over the documents\nSo I understand it's on track it's a little more complicated than him just saying released it release it the second lawyers are on it is is the latest that I heard my sources\nBut I think I Hope that they get released before the election because I think the American people deserve to see it\nYeah it well to try to put them in jail he needs help himself\nWas and I I Will tell you this has been a soft coup attempt\nThere's no doubt about we know what the insurance policy is\nWe don't delete strategy is we know that they knew there was no Russia Trump collusion even in the words of Peter Struck there's no they're they're Lisa Page even saying no we had nothing\nThat's why they started leaking the the phony dusty I information all the left wing or just in the news media they never told them that it was on verified are uncorroborated\nLike they never told the pies or courts that it was on verified uncorroborated they tried to lie to us manipulate us would live from Russia or the Hillary paid for before the election\nAnd they tried to take down a duly elected president after the election so you're right um but I promise you I'm On a listen I can walk and chew gum

Bush nobody said that and I just thought something was a boy there was something about Donald Trump and you look at here we are almost two years later and Donald Trump remade American politics and just look at how many politicians are trying to out Trump\nTrump I mean you got Elizabeth Warren this past week I mean she really stepped in it because\nShe had you know obviously he really got under her nerve and she\nTook debate you know she did the one thing ... I'm sure some genius who now looking for work said hey I've got a great idea you're going to have your big presidential rollout let's do it three weeks before the midterm elections when all the Democrats are just trying to stay\nOn the offensive because we're ahead and what does she do she makes a big announcement hey I might be one thousands Native American that is just crazy because people are trying to out do Trump\nBecause that's how I noticed the accurate one one thousand twenty four Native American ... percent European but the thing is the first minority woman ever\nTenured professor at Harvard I mean she did it for organizations she was a part of she did it at U. Penn when she was a I guess teaching their wrote this this was a disc for her was a calling card stores\nAnd ... and remember Shawn you go back to a a month ago before she imploded like this uh you know the the mainstream media regarded her as perhaps the one democratic standard bearer who could\nAt her age with her stance take on a lot of the Bernie Sanders positions of and and she was a senator and she was relatively young so ... and then she does this so now\nIn the past week essentially the mainstream media kind of turned on her it's like they they called her up that was a dumb idea why because they want to find somebody who is a viable alternative to Donald Trump and they can win and with this kind of baggage she's not going in place\nWhat do you think as you look at and we look at polls every day and I watch Fox and friends and I watch you guys you do a great show\nThe polls every day and I watch Fox and friends when I watch you guys you do a great show you the number one new show on cable news by far in your hour and you have been for years and then like me you've almost been there from the beginning not quite ... how many years that you've been on the air at Fox\nI actually started a two weeks after we went on the air\nSee I have two weeks seniority on you\nSay oh I I Do know Rick regarding\nThe current congressional races I happen to know a America's favorite political correspondent Peter juicy who uh is at this minute I\nWish I had to buy ...\nLet me interrupt here you've got to be so proud of that kid he not only is there a great great kid that I've gotten to know and yeah he's been on my show many times in a great reporter I mean he's a you've got to be so proud of that\nShowing you've known him since he was can I Know it's crazy crazy it is crazy but a ... it looks like his mother [laughter]\nHe's got his mother's hair I'll just say that I'm\nPeter told me that he was a you know he's following the elections very carefully and he's got a source of income both sides of the aisle one of the guys who is in charge of buying the ads for the Republicans in Washington DC said that over the last two weeks they see a essentially\nA five point bump across the board for Republicans and they're basing that that they attribute it to Kavanaugh\nBe attributed to taxes and they attributed to immigration\nAnd so given the fact that uh the enthusiasm level is higher boat suddenly applicants are spiking\nAt exactly the right time the big question is and I know a Newt Gingrich I think he resigned with us like you said in the election comes down to to think Kavanaugh in the care of in in the Caribbean and of course of course of action by the United states hey Mexico do something about this or going to have to put a troops on our southern border and shut it down\nWell I think the caravan is it really does highlight the case here and I got to tell you something the way the Democrats abandon I mean when you become the party\nOf all we want to raise taxes we want to open borders we want Obamacare we want to impeach Trump a and I'm telling you if this is not the agenda as it's going to work and in hiding who you really are which is another problem but what was in the book is phenomenal what what was the recipe you Brian and ...\n... the the the cookbook is all about foods that make you happy and you you look you're a Hannity's or corn beef and cabbage because it reminds you of when you work\nYou and you have one older ones and it's my ... my favorite show it was so full of it but go ahead [laughter]\nUh Brian's that takes him back is his bombs meatballs Inslee is her mom's a chicken demand we've got a Sarah Huckabee Sanders pecan pie remember the famous pie last year people\nSaid that she hardly talk to you know she really does but her secret behind but she she crushes them with a hammer which is appropriate I remind my mind is my mom's pot roast month power although it's religious\nRight Steve dizzy I started cooking one morning thank you for being with us stayed hundred ... all one Sean has a number listen if you're like Linda and let's say you're Twenty years old and you're taking a vacation of a lifetime and you're in Mexico\nAnd you kind of a little bit hammered you might have be a little bit of ... and you haven't won big party and then some guy says what do you like to duplicate this vacation every year for the rest of your life", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "College Station", "day": "18"}
