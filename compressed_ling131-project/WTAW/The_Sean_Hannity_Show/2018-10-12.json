can actually see this video you can see it coming out of their own mouth they're the ones who are selling it so we are confirming the suspicions what you just said we've confirmed that and again it's

what the president staffer thinks the Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe said quote we don't say this out of these walls\nHe says will be a good Democrat and what that means he'll be a good Democrat that means that he's going to vote with the Schumer wing of the party once she gets elected kind of see they don't want them even the Democrats don't want them to be Chuck Schumer democratic so all this is pretty amazing stuff Sean and uh\nYou know it's just we're confirming what was known for years\nYou know you you think back and you you think Peter Struck and he talked about smelly Wal Mart

the voters and and again and so if people think that it requires all this espionage it doesn't you walk into the office after the question staffers all tell you the same thing\nThat most people we

courage to admit that those who have been leading in California for so long now\nWill Gavin Newsom stands with the lobbyists and the insiders found time someone stands California's keys\nI'm John card\nAnd I want to be your governor\nRight so is it possible that there could be a California miracle out there now one other an addendum to this is there are number races house races\nEspecially in Southern California and that would be even our friend Dana Rohrabacher seed and Darryl ISIS old seat\nThese are really important speech it as much as they could determine the\nThe balance of power in the U.S house of representatives go anywhere from Los Angeles straight on down well frankly the whole state of California you have to get out and vote for these congressional candidates because otherwise Nancy Pelosi could end up being speaker but\nIs it possible that there could be a California miracle anyway a Republican John Cox who is uh I I think you're surprised so far a lot of pollsters nobody thought you'd get within single digits ever\nAnd one poll how'd you within five\nA thanks for having me on a Sean and you're right\nI was listening to your earlier remarks about a Florida and everything and uh you said help is on the way that's actually our message to the people of California that\nGavin Newsom political class has resulted in the highest housing prices the highest gas prices water is being rationed in California you're right he's proposing new open\nAll the way they should rationing the water because of the delta smelled so I went out there and never knew this district is a great guy and if you're in the in the San Joaquin Valley I was out and I did a show from there a couple of years ago when the farmers who couldn't farm because they were saving water for those little itsy bitsy fish called the delta smelt\nThat's part of it Shawn but they haven't built a reservoir out here in Thirty years imagine\nCalifornia if it hadn't built a road in the last Thirty years can you imagine what the congestion would be like it it's all\nHorrible anyway and but they haven't built a reservoir and we built one desalination plant that shook Twenty years because a lawsuit and regulations and you know we've got to do more just sell nation we got to do more recycling we got a Bill Maher reservoirs that's all the rest Jordan but the political class you're right they don't want to do that they want to say\nReservoirs that's all there is to it but the political class you're right they don't want to do that they want to save a little tiny fish which is wonderful but we got to live\nWell farmers got a farm and that is such a big part of the California economy I mean you're growing oranges and avocados and and all sorts of other\nYou know strawberries and and fruits and vegetables you may not know this about me but I Lived in Santa Barbara five years of my life when I was broken and have you on what I was a porous guy in ten apart by the time but\nUh I Love the weather out there and when I had my first orange picked up a tree which I stole a it was like a bad thing I've ever had in my life\nUm let me ask you this so you have a Thirteen and a half percent state income tax rate out there you are a sanctuary state not a city whole state\nAnd now the avenue someone's free health care for everybody is is he putting up a sign that says if you get sick come here will take care of your\nI saw that the Newt and said that all the other governors around the country are probably pull it for a new so so they can send anybody who is ill to California\nAnd our taxpayers will pay a their health care you know that's ridiculous shot I mean even for months that they didn't want single payer health care but you know new so is\nBasically just offer anything free to anybody and in the process what he's doing is he's going to make California even more unaffordable than it already is a\nI the people know that this guy mismanaged San Francisco you didn't fix the homeless problem there he's personally compromised he's a\nMuch empty suit was put in business by a billionaire Getty family and I think people want somebody like myself I I struggled I built a small business I've got results in the private sector a and I think that's what people are looking for\nHow come the people of California then maybe I should ask the same question to myself because we're not far behind you in New York state with nine point nine percent high the highest income tax rate why did the people of California to take a Thirteen and a half percent\nIncome state income tax rate and and there's no rebellion out there why are they taking that crap\nIt's beyond me and a lot of people are leaving Sean as you might know California has had an exodus of people\nTo ... New York New Jersey in Illinois what everybody's saying in Texas and Florida and in the Carolinas you can come but if you're going to bring your dopey dumb liberal policies with you know stay home [laughter]\nI don't blame them I talk to Greg Abbott about that is that they are they're they're they're ruining the politics of that stayed although I think\nThey'll still survive lets it we've got to make sure that California is affordable that it's open for business Sean our education system is now buying with Mississippi for one of the worst education results in the\nMountain to be the best ... you'll be the best you know look I don't know\nWhat the I don't know what your odds are I Will say this I I really hope that the people of California pay attention because you know putting a businessman in their California is one of the most beautiful states in the union and its spin literally being destroyed from within by politicians\nAnd I hope the people of California rise up and realize that this is happening to them and the idea is Gavin Newsom of putting out there are so dumb and so it cost prohibitive that it's going to end up being a disaster for everybody and there'll be just the further mass exodus of tax dollars nobody's going to want to be there so I Wish you luck on\nThe if you look around the country and look at Maryland Massachusetts uh you know a Nebraska Arizona Kentucky they've elected Republican business people who have spent a career solving problems delivering resolved making life better for people", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "12"}
