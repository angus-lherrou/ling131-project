the right\nMinnesota campaigning Sunday saw man kicking her yard signs a taunting her into one thing other GOP candidates\nAnd she said please stop he refused things an anarchist could do whatever they want\nSo the politician did what every red blooded American would do she tried to catch the incident on video and then the assailant was having none of that cursing at are backing or into the street and tell her to go kill yourself then walk to a nearby BP presumably to stop stock up on\nYou know whatever she does a mountain dew whatever it happens to be the go to source or whatever but Anderson gave chase in her car the man in charge there to her again leaning through the window punching her\nYou know I I mean it's unbelievable\nAnd that's fine incident came two days after another House Republican candidate Shane ... was punched in the face in St George township northeast of St Cloud is just campaigning in a bar in a restaurant with a larger guy approaches them described the conversation as Amy a bull until the guy\nLiterally and invoke the hallowed name of the middle class the man we can only assume didn't wish to hear another politician talking about or whatever\nIt's only punches the Republican in the face\nOh getting their faces oh ah create a crowd you know follow them\nInto a grocery stores gas stations department stores restaurants they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnthony Scaramucci is with us by the way next week he's got a great book I've been reading it I got an early copy it's phenomenal and it's called the Trump the blue collar president ah I Know it's too early to talk about the book but you'd tell some amazing stories about who really Donald Trump is where he came from and\nAnd his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot reading and how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know your your your match you know a lot of very interesting things and one thing I always remember that the president he may hit hardest Sean\nA buddy always hits second and the often hits last I've never seen him unilaterally come after anybody it's only after the attack him\nThat he doubled down and starts to counter punch you know so Elizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas or a Republican candidate in the primary Jackie him and he fires off the nickname\nYou're sort of the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy until you start shooting at him then once you start shooting at him he's gonna hit you with the full force\nAnd just sort of gives a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nAnd let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and\nHe he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street to the heat and ah and I know both I mean\nYou know yell and yell at me he yelled at me after the cursing gotta remember like\nThe the guy Ryan Lizz have legs are total wire she basically faded\nMe into the call but then he's asking me to do a profile with them and then that's when I have responded with the exploit it but you know what it is what it is ... ... what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less\nStreet Anthony I Need more Harvard Anthony but you know what ... what makes you great on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close is that we both have a little bit of that in a story when you were a bus\nIn ... when I was washing dishes bussing tables you know I was a cook yeah that's right but you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life\nAnd I don't know I mean I I think a lot of us that are blessed and lucky and successful I met too many people that forget what they come from and I'm not going to forget where I came from and I'm just style and so it's not in ...\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story a law where we were in these aspirational working class families in our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents into the American dream\nAnd so ah what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way you see if we can make that happen for people\nThat were similarly situated or currently similar similarly situated the way we were\nIn the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks of never broke my boiled cheats on the president because I really do believe this horse in the right place and I really believe that uh you know she is the right\nBut that is in line the proof is in the ... I mean when when you go to Robin ... eight years adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more poverty\nYou can't get three they only president never to get three percent GDP Growth the worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we got four point two percent for the second quarter GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter\nYou know now we have four million more Americans working eight million out of off of food stamps and out of poverty I'm thinking okay finally the forgotten men and women\nThe young Scaramucci's in Hannity's now doing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nI you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing to do\nI you know ... and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing to de layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back on shore of the United states I Know you talk a lot of that uh the re engineered now after the U.S MCA now\nUh Shaun I'd gone through that you know I'm trained as an economist and I'm running an eleven and a half billion dollars on that I Am\nA that is going to have monumental positive benefits\nTo middle and lower middle class families\nThe re engineering of that trade agreement because it's just the configuration of the cars just the uh the manufacturing point and the price on labor or that's been agreed to in those agreement is going to mean more disposable income for working class family and by the way you know where was the establishment politicians\nThinking about those people over the twenty five years of NAFTA shock well where where they\nKnow where a quick break right back will continue more with

back is there a shot that Elizabeth Warren could lose her Senate seat in Massachusetts that's next [noise]\nThe criminal justice system being racist front to back she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're a one percent or but she also herself deducted fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes That's Elizabeth Warren\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons deducting their use the underwear as if that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear [laughter] and they put a value to it\nYou know I've always said the Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pays forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else the tax cuts to the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they want to eliminate eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter of about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people now this is right after a congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even was critical\nOr she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I've actually\nPut two billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November six with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years from Rhode Island\nAh in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this was by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever and sports ...\nAnnual hall Ben up by bend a bus that a lot so beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through this I don't know what to tell them\n[laughter] look Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not enjoy my race Curt Schilling indoors but most importantly\nBy the way where he ... he needs to endorse you [laughter] and we need to get that ...\nIs the most hated man except for the New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a nominal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wife who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight [laughter] well look at you know Sean a lot has changed since you've been here unemployment now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty nine that's that's for the whole country but Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two dozen Seventeen that have given our state\nMore money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like a Nancy Pelosi and that she if she had her way would undo that\nAnd raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent with the the baseline and she's not sure she hit Ninety percent might be too much when she was on ah MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course\nShe wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a third teaching which six trillion dollar price tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like uh people\nThat do you think so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nRight government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs ones government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know Elizabeth Warren complains about the cost of college\nCourse she charged three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard uh but you know the fact is when government becomes the ... of the loans or whether it's a student assaults or not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive the cost of the year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it was competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between Lola pay attention to you know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here\nOver her to become president you got to reelect her and you have to deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well in eraser\nThanks Sean if people want to get involved it's not too late deal for Senate dot com GI ... es all our Senate dot com if you want to get involved or help out\nTwenty days till election day just promised me won't turn out to be Ben Sasse if you win
