C. M. O. radio Kansas City Marty it's your turn\nEither thank you very much ... in your last newsletter you're talking about the inverted you same to measure that\nBy a federal funds rate versus the ten year treasury note I read another article this youth or some other author\nUses the two year no versus the ten year old that I read yet another article that said we can't use a two year versus the ten year because of current international money flows I said what he meant was that a lot of foreign buyers of treasury notes are skewing that\nAt a relationship\nOr if you look at the two year versus the whole year it's pretty close I mean they're getting pretty close but if you use to use the federal funds rate versus the ten year they're not that close at all so I Would like to hear your comments on it is your life\nWell I Can't comment on the others that you quote but I Will certainly speak for myself there was a reason\nThere was a reason a really good reason that we mentioned in the um uh the August investment letter that we used the um we'd like to use the federal funds rate compared to the ten year treasury you remember what we said there\n[noise] uh I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to but I did read it [laughter]\nWell I'll read the paragraph actually from the I'll read the paragraph from the August investment letter\nAnd uh\nThat will shed light on it let me read it word for word because uh normally take a short time\nThe interest rate spread is one of the ten components of the leading economic index compiled by the conference board monthly\nThis component measures the difference between the ten year treasury yields and the federal funds rate\nI'll read that portion of the paragraph and ask you if that sheds any light\nOn why I have a focused on that particular metric\nOf so okay so if we get our inverted deals or with a two year of the ten year\nNo see that's not what I said well no that's that's not what I was talking about I was telling me about the question you asked which was why did I use the federal funds rate versus the ten year treasury yields\nAnd\nAs I said in the investment letter in August the interest rates spread which is what you're talking about is one of the ten components of the leading economic index compiled by the conference board monthly\nAnd this component measures the difference between the ten year treasury and the federal funds rate does that answer the question you had about why I selected that particular comparison\nI'm somewhat but\nUh so if there was a negative view for with a two year and the ten year that would really worry oh\nI don't want to see a negative yield curve anywhere\nI don't want to see a negative yield curve anywhere but my focus would be right now on the short term rate the federal funds rate versus the ten year and the reason I like to focus on that is that that is a component in the leading economic index\nActs like thank you very much for your time\nThank you for calling now\nBottom line that all of this is\nYou'll curves of matter and we always get the same crowd this same\nComes out of the woodwork every little time this happens they come out of the woodwork every single time this happens and they say\nThey come out of the woodwork every single time this happens and they say oh this time it's different uh this time it doesn't matter because ABC indie\nWell let me be clear I think it met I think\nThe yield curve is important you know I think the yield curve is very important\nAnd so if you get into a situation where you get an inverted you'll gr for example between the leading economic index you'll or method which is the federal funds rate versus the ten year treasury\nI think that's a big deal there are a lot of other factors that come into play that such a lead times lead time on you on the inversion become very important at that\nPoint and there's a lot more in addition to that\nBut if we're talking about the basic do yield curve inversions met er yeah I think they matter is there a way that measures yield curve in versions that is consistent with the leading economic index yeah there is federal funds versus ten years\n\nWe're

that come into play on this I Would say that um the principal factors that make the ten year right go up\nWould be a inflation expectations which is really a market factor of Federal Reserve monetary policy is you know they're on a dual track right now raising rates in the quantitative tightening along with it that's certainly a factor\nAnd I would say those would be the major factors what is the Federal Reserve doing but when you look at federal policies in response to what's going on\nAnd so that's where the inflation expectations become very very important\nAs inflation expectations increase the Federal Reserve tends to further tightening monetary policy [noise] so you have that going on as well but with the fed on a dual track right now we're in uncharted waters on that policy this has really never occurred before\n\nOkay thank you very much\nI think you'd done yeah and I think that uh this is something will have to continue to monitor I'm On the one hand you know some people might say gee now why is a fed chair Jerome Powell on concerned are particularly I'm concerned about inflation right now\nWhen the consumer price index is two point nine percent year over year and the answer is because that's really not the one he is focusing on he and his compiled raised at the fed they are focusing on the core personal consumption expenditures index\nAnd that has been very very close to the target level established by the Federal Reserve that target level is two percent to point out\nWell it's been like right in the one point nine percent area recently and based on the uh estimates that are out there are some people expect to get up to the two percent level when ah when the data's released on the revised gross domestic product\nOr this coming week there will be the revised ... number one data there'll be revised number two data coming a month later and so that's just quarterly data though that's not the import all important your your number so when we take a look at the fed policy\nWe have to consider okay they're raising rates okay they're throwing debt onto the market in the form of the corner the tightening program as they remove it from their balance sheet in very large numbers trillions\nActually over time and so all of these factors come into play and uh that's why it's really important what the fed chair says about\nWhat's going on with inflation and what are you saying right now is he is not\nEspecially exercised about the rate of inflation that's because he's focusing on the fact that we've had this personal consumption expenditures core inflation right in at one point nine percent area perhaps to go to ... percent soon while he's OK with that because that\nWas the level that the federal open market committee established as its target back when figures were lower now the reason and this comes up all the time the reason they don't want to go below two percent\nIs because they really fear deflation\nIn the eyes of the fed one of the worst things are going to happen is deflation because when you get deflation than the opposite of inflation happens what happens with inflation was inflation you're paying back your debt with\nThe pre she aided money and networks in your favor against your debt payment\nThat applies to the interest and the principal with deflation you're paying back your debts and increasing cost because the value of your money is going down [noise]\nAnd so that increases the cost of your debt [noise] you're the value of your money is critical in this case [noise]\n'cause you have the PlayStation [noise] your debts become more expensive and your interests when that's become more expensive the opposite effect of the places\nOn your desk and humid [noise] more to come stay with us [noise] right here on Monday he's money [noise]\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars have some experts say another crashes coming ... you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins that IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us are precious metals right now at eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying from coffee\nTea or smoking powered swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shades even better there is no messy strip search traits that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just swap you're cheap for five minutes and you're done to try and power swabs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night you're white white smile will have your friends\nTalking about how great you look try at risk free\nUh so uh you know you have to consider is if you made a four year forecast on the market\nIn Nineteen Ninety eight it probably would not have been they asked him the five hundred being an eight hundred right because it was in the mid teens there when we got around year two thousand so making a four year for kids do more of the market's going to be as as a ... a activity\nBut uh certainly I think at this point you have some time here where you should be able to um to hopefully benefit from having some money in the total stock market index in that account\nAnd uh I I Would just be sensitive to the fact that you don't want to get to the point where I let me ask you would you be writing tuition checks out of this account\nYes well then you want to see that's what I'm Talking about\nYou want to manage that account and such a way\nThat uh you're not going to get caught in the bear market at a time when you're writing tuition checks you don't want to go there so you want to provide some liquidity provision in that account it's going to enable you to have that money available for tuition without having to sell out of a beer market\nHypothetically if one were to occur at the time ... years down the road\nWhere you needed that inquisitive and I think that would be the most important\nPoint lawn checking in from the gate great paying us radio in the mile high city of Denver, Colorado let's get Jim on the line in Vallejo gym it's your turn\nTo a high above and first of all I Want to thank you for your your uh not sharing your knowledge or with everyone it's like I Can't tell you how much it's appreciate it [noise] ah my my question is\nI Want to transfer I Want to balance my portfolio to ride around fifty fifty and ah that means I've got to move over from\nA non Ira\n... ah I have a total stock market non Ira total stock market into a bond fund and I'm concerned about possible tax consequences\nThe ... and\nIt's about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars so but I have to pay do I have to pay taxes first of all and would I uh\nHave to pay taxes from the time I started that fun or on today in today's current him out or how would that work\nAll right well let's talk about this account now what type of than the count is this three hundred and fifty thousand in right now\nIt's in the I'm a total bond market\nOkay which is another issue I well I'm sure with you 'cause you've suggested or a short term and my phone company recommends vanguard they recommend that I don't do that\nYeah well I like where they are they're they're not going to agree with everything I say and I'm not going to agree with everything and they say you can take that to the bank um so you have three hundred and fifty thousand dollars right now invested in the total bond market how long has that been invested their\nNo I I Want to transfer over three hundred and ... it's been in there for a least a couple of years\nAll right let's start this over what type of an account is this\nA both are non Ira accounts\nSo this is a personal ... this is personal money yes okay\nSo you have a three hundred and fifty thousand you have the three to fifty thousand dollars in personal money is that right\nRight I Want to transfer it over and I want to\nLet me just let me just go step baby steps here so I can get this straight so we have three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in personal money where's that money right now\nIt's at a ... a total stock market\nIs that what you mean more so this is stunning talk mark yes and how long has it been there oh\nYears and years and years I'd say OK so he has gotten Fifteen Twenty years\nAnd years and they don't extreme ...\nI'm Sorry so it stunk extremely well you have a low cost bass or so yes it's really done well well if you sell any shares now have you use the average cost basis or have you used a specific costs basis\nI'm not familiar with well when you bought the shares did you buy them all at once yes\nOkay well then in that case that the by definition that is specific cost basis because you only made one purchase how much money did you put in do you remember\n[noise] no I don't but um I'll take it was somewhere around\nOh I'd have to save somewhere around seven hundred thousand\nAnd now it's up to about a ... a one point seven five million\nSo I Want to take off your only taking your only taking a portion of that\nYeah I'm taking a maybe a third or thereabouts me I was little bit more\nSo a well three fifty out a one and three quarters would be a\nBe a lot less than a third it'd be maybe twenty percent something like that so I'm here's the deal\nSeveral ... many years ago you put approximately you can look it up but you're guessing seven hundred thousand and the total stock market index is that right\nYes okay yes\nAnd uh and some very well screw into one point seven five now all this time that you've owned that fund\nWhich I guess is the vanguard till the stock market index correct right I Know around ... you know I own a fun I Know this one well I've owned a fund for a long long time\nSo you've received dividends on that fun on a quarterly basis and in some cases over time capital appreciation what has happened to those distributions that they've paid out to the shareholders\n[noise] oh I keep I just keep them in that in that find\nOkay you reinvest them I reinvest uh okay\nThen in that case your costs basis is not as simple as that would have been because by reinvest thing you have created new cost bases each time you've reinvest it so what you might want to do is um\nShe if you could develop and they might help you at the ... family\nUm she if you could develop a new might help you at the ... family if you could develop or maybe they've already provided you with an average cost basis is that okay I\nDon't really know you're going to have to know you're going to have to know because when you make transactions gym and a personal account\nYou're going to be subject in your case to federal and state taxation on the game\nAnd uh your maximum currently under current law your maximum federal tax liability and the highest bracket would be twenty three point eight percent of any money that you take out on the game\nThe only ... percent ... well that's just federal I didn't get your state yet what twenty three point eight percent would be the highest rate you would have to pay if you're in the top bracket\nUh on any games that could be less if you're in lower brackets it could be less than that but then on top of that you're going to have to pay state tax on any gain you take out now in the state you live in the ... the top bracket would be about forty one percent\nAnd I'm In the lower ... probably know among the lowest uh\n... that's ... that's going to help you that's going to bring it way down because if you're in the minimal brackets you can get down to very very low percentages you want to figure this out with your tax preparation expert or your enrolled agent for your CPA to find out what kind of a tax liability and we're going to have cars you want to reserve that money because you're into to pay that money out\nTo a Washington at the end Sacramento in the form of taxes by if you take these games this year you'll have to make those payments by a while of that's part of you as part of your tax\nPayments that you're making one year two thousand Eighteen return you don't have to file your return to the next year but you may have to make estimated payments depending on how large numbers are that's between you and your account or your enrolled agent or a CPA but whatever I think bottom line here you might have some tax liability and I think if you do take three hundred fifty out\nI think it will at some tax liability 'cause your money has well more than doubled while you've added in there and by the way even taking the average cost in most of your cost is going to be based on your initial expense of approximately seven hundred thousand dollars\nSo I I wouldn't I Would ask you to go through all of that as far as the other a part of it going into the total market no I Would not do that\nOkay how are you mentioned short short duration bonds bond\nFund yeah yeah and you know if you don't want to if you don't want to do that there's a really simple way for you to do it you can do a a a letter of the\nThree six nine twelve months CDs equal amounts\nIn that case you could spread it out roughly close to Ninety thousand and three months six months nine months twelve month when the three month comes through your role within twelve month that keeps your three six nine well sequence intact you're fully FDIC insured when you do this I wouldn't do it any other way fully FDIC insured\nAnd uh that way you're not taking any risk with the money because you have FDIC behind you and because it's held the maturity you're guaranteed by the FBI see get back your principal and interest\nOr as long as you're under the insured amount so that's the approach you could take no I Would not be going out into some intermediate term duration bond funds because I I think that the\nUh I personally think it's not a good thing to be doing it this time I'm not doing it I'm not recommending it and that's why I Would rather be in the shorter to ration", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day":
