E. and north to Alaska\nMoney talk is the program that helps you to learn how to become your own personal financial manager manager and that's a really big deal because that makes it possible for you to manage your personal finances\nFor the rest of your life that's a very very big deal if you empower yourself to be your own personal financial manager for yourself and your family you have accomplished\nSomething really outstanding hey somebody has to do it otherwise they just throw you to the sharks you don't need that little sharks swimming on by\nRight here on Monday talk you can learn to strategies and the tools to achieve personal financial freedom so that if you're not already there you can join the money talkers literature there\nSo that if you're not already there you can join the money talkers litter there right now residing in a land of critical mass\nHey we appreciate your joining us thank you very much for making his a part of your weekend right here on Monday talk\nOn the money's talked broadcast we have talked in the past\nAbout the issue of valuation valuation is a very very important part of stock market analysis because there's evaluation range and there's a\nValuation normalcy within that range that prevails most of the time personally let's look at the historical range of valuation and we're measuring this by a widely used\nA item which is called the P. E. ratio that stands for the price\nDivided by the earnings ratio\nSo one method of valuing a stock or the stock market is to determine what the PE ratio the price earnings ratio is and then to compare that with\nHistorical norms and then also to compare that with some of the critical variables that have an impact on the P. E. ratio most especially things like inflation expectations and interest rates\nSo when we take a look at the historical range of PE ratios as they would apply for example to the standard and Poor's five hundred index we see that over the very very long term the range has been quite wide for example\nBack in Nineteen Seventy four when the stock market was in the throes of a brutal bear market that lasted for close to two full years\nBecause the bear market back then that led to that very very low historical valuation figure started in January of Nineteen Seventy three in fact it started right at the same time that the peace treaty was signed with\nNorth Vietnam bringing an end to the war in Vietnam so we're back to January Seventy three and the market right at the time the peace treaty is\nOf the does that make sense I mean I felt with there's no there's no capital gains and I guess I can just agree by them and or the other counts as that does that a wise move\nWell I think that um here's the consideration there let's go back to the basics here why is it that investors benefit from having stocks in their personal money\nAnd bonds and their tax privileged money the answer is because the interest that you are in on a taxable bond\nIs subject to taxation in your case a lot of taxation in New York City or the interest that you've earned whereas if you put it in a tax revenues to count then\nIt's a it's not going to be that year you're not going to have to pay income tax on taxable income because it's in the tax privilege to count whereas with your stocks when you have those in your personal account you get the benefit\nOf the law if you hold it for a long term you get the benefit of the long term capital gain rule which limits your tax bill the somewhat although I have\nTo say in your case in\nYour case in the top bracket you it'd be paying long term capital gains at the federal level including the healthcare tax would be ... you'd also pay the state of New York in the city of New York so in your case your your tax bill in a personal account I could see it getting up probably\nIn the vicinity of thirty percent right [laughter] so so you see because you're in such a very very high tax area\nIt's a you know probably less of a factor here's the consideration do if you're held it for a short term then you get married because you're going to pay the top rate if you're in the top bracket plus New York last in the city\nYour way into the forties now to make it even worse for you to make it even worse for you you are losing the duct ability of your New York state\nIncome tax you're in New York City income tax and you're in New York state sales tax\nAny property taxes above ten thousand dollars so New Yorkers are getting the chef\nRight so in my case it really wouldn't make much difference of a\nWell because of your very high tax bracket is not is not a dramatic difference\nOkay and west question should this ... at my I have a forty six the allocation of decided and ... years old does this seem too many socks does that seem like too much to me stocks\nYou have a forty percent equity allocation\nForty percent of equity a\nYeah I think at that age I probably would not be troubled uh assuming you have a favorable market outlook I Would probably not be troubled by okay\nI I could live with fifty fifty but I Know that people in the ... but\nNot what I that's not what it is not what I said David Oh thank you for ... let me thank you\nYeah but that's not what I that's not what it is not what I said David Oh thank you for ... let me thank you for calling a I Would be comfortable with the allocation that you have right now and I do appreciate the call let's get out the Santa Fe New Mexico listening to the great K. K. O. B. radio Albuquerque Paul welcome to talk\n[noise] hey Bob good afternoon that's in a I appreciate you listening for a long time and I know how you feel\nAbout the federal deficit and how it has such a good effect on the national debt and I would I I personally think that Republicans were very critical asking this tax cut because they have always been so critical of the opposition\nUh for the lack of interest in the dead now I think the Republicans have just been very hypocritical because the effects that this tax cut will have on the debt and I just I Hope I Would like to hear your commentary on it\nAnd see if if you if you say the same thing that I Do think about\nThat you know thank you Paul I must say I have not been hearing anything at all out of Washington\nD.C from the GOP you about the annual deficit or the national debt I haven't been hearing anything at all it's basically been radio silence on the subject of the national debt and the annual deficit let's get Chris on\nThe line in San Ramon Chris it's your turn\nHi, Bob thank you for taking my call good to have you with us\nThank you um my question basically is whether it's wise for me to use that money manager I'm I'll tell you my situation I'm retired I have that two and a half million dollars a for investing and currently I have a lot of ads in portfolio three\nI'm but I'm a little bit uneasy about putting all of my money into that portfolio um and it's just I I don't know why exactly I think it's an emotional thing putting so much into seven money um mutual funds so I recently met with a financial adviser\nAnd um she gave the game a couple of points I was just wondering if if he would comment on them um she of course thinks I should do that a manager and I'm One of the reasons why she said anyone with over five hundred thousand dollars\nOr should be an individual stocks as opposed to mutual funds because of the fees involved the risk of over diversifying and the inability to Harvard law says harvest losses and maximize games\nUm and I was just wondering if you had a comment on that question is also the fees that they're going to charge which I think our little high at one point two five up to a million dollars but um besides that um do you have any comment on her and the other reasoning that that she is\nWell I think it's an adult rated nonsense let's take a point by point what's the first point you're like me to comment on\nHow well the face for mutual\nWell a ... a million dollars a one on a quarter that's twelve thousand five hundred dollars what are you getting for twelve thousand five hundred dollars\nWhat are you getting a well I guess\nThe ability to move the money around faster um\nWell whoa whoa whoa I I don't even know what that means if you if you have a portfolio for example of index funds you can as a general rule you can call up the phone family and move money at will on the telephone or even better do we go on line\nMany people do it on line so I don't even know what that means moving money around faster\nAnd has no meaning particularly pointed out that it takes a day to you know ... and if you get the prize at the end of the day when you saw a mutual fund as opposed to the\nMedia are are are they suggesting or they suggesting this is incredible or they suggesting to you that you would receive a benefit because they would be able to de trade as opposed to trading at the close of the market on a given day\nIs that the implication that they would be day trading within the day and you wouldn't have to wait till the end of the day because of that is what they're saying\nThen that makes no sense at all to me\nWell that was one of their points I think they were sort of pointing out getting off the market if we if we're predicting a drop in the market we could get out more quickly I think that was\nOr do they do they have a history of having successfully called drops in the market of that sort and then re entering after the drop\nHas been complete or near ... near complete 'cause they have a history of that there's been proved to you document\nHow would that be proven I Do think she has\nA there's a good question there is a good question there is a good question well look obviously are obviously Chris this person is a sales person right and ... and wants to open the account so that the fees can be accrued to the company I understand all that\nI I don't know I I haven't heard anything from this presentation\nThat would suggest to me that I should shell out twelve thousand five hundred dollars\nWhen I have a situation where I have a portfolio that is predominantly invested in index funds a portfolio that has performed very very well\nUh yeah I've been giving me a single reason\nThe over diversification is not\nI don't even know what that means what the heck does that mean if I owned a total stock market index\nThen which you do by the way and muddled three then that means that I Am I essentially own the length and breath\nOf the companies across America uh I don't even know what I mean to me that sounds like something for the I'm On a negotiated over diversification if I have the total stock market index\nAm I Am I ... I might well diversified of course I'm very well diversified if I might overdo versus what the heck does that mean this has money to [noise]\nThis is money to [noise]\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars value some experts say another crashes coming ... you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but we've gold and silver coins and then I arrived from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical golden silver can hedge against inflation calling us are precious metals right now at eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book you'd want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores in Brazil on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright an editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author ... should get that seat hunger advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nI was and I'm going back into portfolio number one [noise] of course I'm going to do the dollar cost averaging at this market but I'm Wondering what they really be\nConsidered as one account or should I really consider them as she was separated they can because it's one of the Iowa one supplier and though they're all they're all tax privileged accounts that's correct Yes sir\nI ... I Do like the top down approach and I would view them as one portfolio\nNext question find me very quick as I said past nine years I have not this and then I'm just getting back on my feet and then but let me let me add something also because of you I was able to um stay home and take care of my spouse has helped\n'em and because of the things that ... I think that\nI'm On the four percent robo of er which still if somebody is making and it's an example fifty thousand dollars a year ... percent Detroit's or is that true that a lot of programs for it's like you were mentioning you need to have like two million dollars in able to\nUm based on a four percent of all of which will have about a thousand dollars and come to you\nI Would say that in order to generate an annual income of fifty thousand dollars a year\nYou would want to have a portfolio of approximately one and one quarter million dollars that would be one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if you were able to engineer a four percent withdrawal rate on that principle then that would give you an annual income\nFrom that particular set of numbers of\nFifty thousand dollars a year I think that in the beginning you could start with the four percent withdrawal guideline you want to review it every year you want to make sure it's working but I think it is a reasonable starting point\nAnd that would mean on a million dollars that would generate approximately forty thousand\nIn gross income and William first of all I Want to thank you for your kind words and secondly I Want to thank you very very much for calling in from Burbank, California and of course our program in Burbank, California and throughout the greater Los Angeles area is on the legendary\n... ABC Radio\nLos Angeles as we go to the great state of Minnesota Roy it is your return\nTaking my call Bob I really appreciate your program I thought of this lady that called in and you're told her how to save twelve thousand five hundred dollars\nBy not doing something your program is invaluable to people I just enjoy it so much listening to all the different questions because boy I tell you you learn a lot by hearing the answers that you've given the reasons why\nBut here's my question I Do subscribe to Bob drinkers market time timer and my question is this\nI Know one portfolio three that you recommend that total stock market or is there anything wrong with having the total stock market and ask them the five hundred yeah and the same retirement account\nI guess what I Would say or would simply be that yes in\nThe five hundred is part of the stock market index\nSo that if you owned a total total stock market index you already own yes and the five hundred\nOkay very good thank you I think you really you don't have less than ... many times that I I never heard anybody ask the question about that I just thought hey I Wonder what the answer would be to that so thank you very much and have a great day\nThank you Roy and Roy is right that was a great question\nDoug is on the line in ... hello Doug welcome to Monday talk\nBob I'm I'm a longtime listener sent her son it's a long time ago\nTalked about the acceleration is also a program where they tax Social Security benefits\nAre under ... and it was upgraded the Ninety three whereby\nEarning thirty four thousand and joined us earning forty four thousand can add eighty five percent of their Social Security benefits exposed to federal income tax rate\nAlthough I'm not mistaken Doug they basically subject all income\nTo state and local taxes in states that have state taxes so whether the income is from Social Security or whether it's from um let's see rental income or whether it's from a salary or whatever it may be if it's income it generally is taxed\nAt the prevailing rates of the state you live in\nAnd what it does is stretched out\nYour Social Security benefit to Fifteen thousand if my thing is about thirty four thousand or my joint four thousand that triggers your tax\nA thousand that trick on my Social Security that I'm\nAbsolutely correct but again this is in the income category this is money that is coming in to you in the form of additional money coming in from your Social Security account so this is income because then the\nWhole ... of course he did on Saturday and\nOf course you did and that's the reason you qualify for those payments but it's it's classified as income and when you classify it is incumbent become subject to the prevailing federal and state taxes under current law\nWell that's true but don't you think that what you don't want to benefit\nI think it's double taxation all income when you when you have federal and state income tax\nOn the states that had that which is a forty one on everything and forty three on earned had that yes of course it's double taxation but it's double taxation on income and that is prevailing across the country\nI'll give you a triple taxation Philadelphia gets triple taxation with the Philadelphia wage tax New York city triple taxation with the New York city income tax so I'll I'll take your double taxation and I'll raise the ... the triple taxi\nThank you Doug received the call very much\nLet's get Jay on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago Jay it is your turn welcome\nThank you I was wondering if you invest in five hundred a total stock market as\nWell uh it's a market risk investment it's a stock market risk investment a zero risk investment would be an FDIC insured CD or a U.S treasury held the maturity held the maturity especially a treasury bill which is short term\nThat would be zero risk investment but if you wanted to take a stock market risk investment that reflected the risk in the stock market at large that would be reflected in the U.S will be five hundred\nBecause I'm I'm a recommendation quite a bit and\nOh no question about it in our active passive and let me thank you for the call Jay thanks for calling\nOr there's no question about it that in our act to pass a portfolio we have a significant application to the market at large by using index fund investing no question about that and so that means that a person that's invested their is willing\nTo take the risk of being in the market and has the tolerance for risk to be they're very important points that I'm Glad

investment funds so does this mean that if I buy an old for ten years in each of\nA referee setting or for example you have to be five hundred index\nAnd during the same uh during this case and the same ATF is being actively traded by speculators will migrate during the life like it would be in a mutual fund or do you think about that vocal was referring to eat in general with the uh\nEasy

fund remember that a mutual funds have three forms they have no load mutual funds loaded mutual funds and exchange traded mutual funds which are called the ...\nSo they're all mutual funds so what he's talking about is\nThat people have traded in and out of exchange traded mutual funds and it's been to the disadvantage to do that trading or because they haven't been able to match the by an old return in that protected and fun that's what he's referring to I see I see\nIf you were a by an old investor for ten years you would learn what the fondue earned and if it was an index fund and yes and the ... century or what the S. and P. earns\nBut if you were trading in and out which is what he was referring to chances are you buy at the top sell at the bottom and not do as well\nI got it

considering that travel around the area where there and\nHow investments how investments and the u._k.\nUm I'd say that fairly Saturday\nThat's good I liked that for a self directed IRA and what I Would do is I go to one of the low cost\nCustodian outfits that have a lot of funds that you can choose from and a lot of no load funds to choose from and I'm Talking about a vanguard or fidelity or someone that has a large stable of low cost to know load funds to choose from they can be your custodian\nAnd you can invest according to your self direction\nOkay and what's your thoughts about diversifying into real estate or other ventures as go ...\nI'm not a I'm not a fan of gold but I certainly would um would\nWould consider owning your principal residents if you could do so do you turn on your principal resin\nI but I don't think the other and living around they argue that\nWell you can live in your own civil resident you can ... um no no I'm not talking about it than I already know I'm not recommending that you put your ah your real estate and you're right you're right no I'm not making that recommendation\nNow there are some that have used real estate investment trust in a IRA accounts and you can do that and I know for example a vanguard they have a a a no load fund which is an index to real estate investment trust\nWhich has many many different companies already IT companies in the index and certainly that's something that if you choose to do so in your mix you can include that but um in terms of putting a rental properties that you would assembled\nNo I Would be disinclined to do it that way appreciates call Kate thank you for joining us good to hear from you\nFor information on my investment letter that spot breakers market timer investment let her go to

the years I've a question for you that you talk about routinely investing into your employer sponsored retirement fund but my question for you today is\nIf I have the funds to maximize my employer match\nUp to the match but beyond should I just go to the match at company match and then do the Ross and then returned back to my company match if I have the funds to do so\nWell that's an option or certainly want to go up to the match I mean that's the no brainer part of your question absolutely want to go up to the match to take full advantage of the free money\nThat the company is giving you in the form of the matching program now or whether you go to a raw or traditional i._r._a. really there is going to the beyond that is going to depend also and whether you want that deduction right now are you in a high bracket\nI I Am\nAnd that would be thirty seven percent so that would be the same as getting a thirty seven percent a tax deduction on the money you put in that's a lot of money\nOkay so that's why we feel that I Would consider that I Would I Would consider that thirty seven percent as of now or if\nYou wanted to diversify more indoor or you could but I think if you're into thirty seven percent top bracket or as a high earner and then I I think that's a really nice instead of going with the traditional ... as long as you qualify under the rules [noise] this is

number one W. B. E. N. radio buffalo although David\nThank you for taking my call I appreciate it um\nBut my question is if I'm pursuing with opportunity and um\nI actually I mean I think that costs money on ... on it or not that I like totally but let me think um I did see the income has been low so [noise] you know\n... or ... what's your take on something like\nThat I'm not going to totally a ... thing it's like an ... no I don't need it they'll just eat\nWell my understanding is that if you are how old are you David\nForty odd\nMy understanding is that at your age if you take money out of your IRA you're going to have to pay a penalty on a withdrawal for not being fifty nine and a half and you're also going to have to pay in Buffalo the prevailing federal and state tax\n\nNow there is a way to potentially reduce your tax burden on that by setting up a seat core and establishing a corporate retirement account\nAnd if you do that if you do that and what I'd recommend because this might be beneficial to you well I Would recommend is that you sit down with a certified public accountant in your case and see if they can be helpful to you\nShow\nBy an hour of their time purchased an hour of their time\nGo over it and see if they can be helpful to you because they may be able to\nUh to help you to set the account up in such a way that you can use the money and reduce your burden because right now without that if you just take money out of an IRA at the age of forty five even if you're using it in your business or to fund anything at that point you have a premature withdraw openly and you have\nFederal and state tax in Buffalo so that's what I Would do a definitely a invested in an hour as a time of the or certify public accountants to go over that let's get out\nTo the show me state of Missouri and Tom is on the line Tom it's your turn\nTo thank you Bob I'm seem like there's been articles or above the death of retail and so forth and I'm Wondering if uh [noise]\nIf that continues if if we could see a situation where the S. and P. five hundred could become the S. and P. fifty or the S P five and where hundreds of companies could just drop\nOut by by having Amazon and Walmart everything\nWell I Know sometimes a must feel like we're heading in that direction I can certainly understand why people would get that feeling I think some people were surprised when Amazon went out and acquired whole foods and the\nUh the Justice Department had very little to say about it uh I I think that there's as long as the Justice Department is inactive\nIn that area then they can just you can acquire as many companies as you can afford to acquire as long as you don't have any uh interference from the Justice Department I mean that's exactly what you saw when Amazon dot com took over whole foods\nOr there was basically no real pushback from the Justice Department the deal went right through it out and pretty quick\nSo that's the way it works if they're not going to say anything about it then certainly companies are going to make strategic mergers\nYeah so it it's a if that becomes extreme it's just a little bit scary about or even ... like S P why having the sector funds and with with the idea that maybe hundreds of those companies could slowly disappear [noise]\nWell I mean it's already happened in a way I mean the number of companies out there has been shrinking pretty dramatically and ah initiative that just looked at the industry's look what's happened to the airline industry where do you have now basically four major carriers\nI mean a couple of decades ago you had a dozen or so so I mean you what do you have now you have four major carriers rage of American you have delta you have south west\nAnd you have a\nAmerican delta southwestern United raging for major carriers and everybody else compared to those carriers their minor players\n[noise] yes uh\nI I was already happened in some sectors\nThat's true\nBut you're right I mean it is there is a trend towards consolidation and consolidation has a tendency to reduce the number of companies that are out there was one exception what about all the start ups what about the new companies that are that are out down there haven't been many IPO's but still there are companies being added\nA seemed like I remember I feels are common at the peak of the market as if sometimes use as an indicator to for the markets cycle and so\nWell there there are a lot of indicators out there okay that I mean they're literally over over you could easily put out over a hundred indicators when you start talking about indicators or keep in mind that okay this indicator might say one thing but another indicator may may say something else\nYeah that's right there's there's tons and tons of indicators and I'm about to I've shows seems\nThere's a there's tons tons of indicators in a ... to ... seems like they're they're not in line with anything that\nThey're not over here at a time limit the er the they're not overheated\nSo so like I say this stuff is all over the less sometimes but when these things start to get on the same page that's a different story that's a different story for sure appreciate the
