America a money matters were twenty five years this is money talks with Bob breaker [noise]\nBreathing use and sun you patients from the starship Monday off everybody\nWill come to the program it's America's Monday program\nMoney you talk coast to coast border to border ... and north to Alaska on the dog is the program that helps you to learn how to become your own personal financial manager that way you can take charge of your personal financial future\nWe talk about everything from investing in your tax revolution accounts to saving for all of those important future goals including the education of the young sprouts\nAnd the way to get the job done is a wire the knowledge is that knowledge that empowers view to control your financial future that's what it's all about money to all\nThe strategy of the tools to achieve that personal financial freedom for yourself and your family so that if you're not already there hopefully someday you can reside in the land of critical mass\nThat isn't that land of critical mass and T shirts you of your personal financial future\nYeah and I think that um are a lot of ways to get to land a critical mass obviously time helps helps you allowed to have time to reach that land a critical mass the um\nThere are a number of things you can do though to help you along the way we've talked about the\nOne of my favorites is paying yourself first which basically means that the first thing you're going to do every month to take care of yourself and your family you by taking if you can afford to do so taking at least ten percent more if you can afford it but at least ... percent of your earnings\nAnd invest in a tax privilege program either at work or in your own business or an IRA whatever\nAnd there is a text there's definitely attack from this program that always would rank first in this pecking order and that would be a four O. one K. with matching\nIf you have a four O. one K. program that has a matching provision that means that your employer has said here's free money take it your job is to take it\nNow typically the way this might work and it varies but if you have a matching program typically the made this the way this might work would be your employer would say that I Will match\nUp to fifty percent of the first six percent you're putting your four one K.\nYou might be lucky enough to have this sort of for three baby but more commonly at a four O. one K.\n\nSo if you put in six percent which is the matching provision limit to get the matching than your employer chips in three percent let's say you make a\nForty thousand dollars a year you're putting in six percent of the forty thousand that's twenty four hundred dollars\nAnd under that provision your employer matching half is putting in three percent or\nTwelve hundred dollars that's free money that's money that your employer is offering to give you for simply taking advantage of the matching provision in the four o one K program oh you have to do is sign up like the contribution\nAnd I'll have a pension I Hope of about fifty seven thousand a year and we don't we don't need a lot to live on everything's paid for and I'm curious what would be your recommendation on\nA which way which money to take for the tax money or the non tax stuff that we've already pay tax on and then my last question I guess on that what you know if he took the four percent like you talk about how many years will outlast with average returns on what's left [noise] [noise]\nWell I think that uh it's helpful to understand how we get to that four percent number\nAnd that will give you a better picture of how long it will last as you\nKnow I recommend having a year in advance set aside so you're never pressured into raising money in a downturn to take out your four percent\nWithdraw if you stay a year ahead I think that's helpful in that regard also take a look at how the money is configured when we look at that four percent first of all we're looking at the total amount when we look at that so we would be looking at\nOn the morning a quarter you have we'd be looking at the potential to withdraw perhaps fifty thousand now if you don't need it you don't do it you take a lower rate if you don't need it sounds like you don't need it I think somebody like yourself\nI think would that pension that you have I think I'd be looking at a lower number I'd probably be looking at three percent and it sounds to me like if you took three percent which is still close to another forty thousand a year on top of your pension\nThat you'd be in a you'd be probably a net saber\nYeah more than I make working right now so I mean that's\nOh there you go I mean some of them I well I think if you go to three percent uh then I think you can basically\nReally an almost all years I think you can do it just based on your dividends and interest I don't think you'd have to do a whole lot of sheer liquidation to get to three percent because here's the way we do it we do it based on the total return now the total return\nConsists of a four components\nFirst component is the interest because obviously as you know I Would be in a balanced portfolio posture and the kind of a lifestyle you're talking about so the first thing I'm doing some generating interest on the income portion of the balanced portfolio so I have my interest income so I have that to add\nSo then my second component is ...\nSo I have that to add so then my second component is going to be my dividends which are going to comment as a result of my for example a mutual fund holdings and then the third component which is going to happen in some years would be capital gains distributions\nAnd then to fourth component only if necessary because the other three are already taxable even into personal account\nThe other three are already taxable your interest your dividends capital gains your fourth component is going to be only if you have to share liquidation and I'll tell you what I think if you go to a three percent withdrawal\nGiven your hefty pension income and you're a you're a modest lifestyle I think at three percent withdrawal rate with all of the interest and dividends and capital gains accumulating you may find that that would be something that would uh almost never require you to liquidate\nOkay great it got to the area in good shape there are\nWell it's uh I'll tell you the most important thing to do when you get there in my opinion\nDecide before you go there what you're going to do\nIt gets very very important to decide in advance and you may have to make some changes along the way after you do it but to have some ideas some decent idea before you do it\nA lot of what you're going to do with your with your time I think that's extremely helpful they are all kinds of things you can do with your time and I just think it makes sense to think about it I don't think it's a good idea to just go home on the last day and a sit down and turn on the TV that's not going to work\nNo no not going to work especially especially given the content of what it's on the group to these days so ah I I think as far as your other question where to take the money first I Do lean\nTo allowing your tax divert money to grow\nUntil you get into our MD ages and the reason is reason is that the first attacks\nOK okay wire said Bob and the like I said hopefully it'll I I've been told that\nThe hardest thing is spending money when you're retired you're afraid that you don't have a check company or anything you know so yeah there are a lot of people well I uh and I well\nI have good news for you Dennis and that is you've already done the hard part actually you've done the hard part which is I mean you are at the land a critical mass based on what you talked about so that's the hard part getting to the land a critical mass from here on your on cruise control Dennis\nOkay thanks lot bother partially alright Joe\nGreat to hear from you\nYou can stream money talk on your computer and download to your smartphone that money to go on demand\nThat way you listen wherever you go whenever you like like so many people do actually all over the world we have money talks on demand subscribers that are able to listen to our broadcast on her own schedule in their own time zone as well as here in the u._s._a.\nSo you can sign up right there at Bob breaker dot com that the money talk on\nDemand logo and of course we we used terminology here on the program that you don't often hear and I understand that and if you're a new listener right we're not trying to lead you astray\nWhen we talk about the land a critical mass were simply talking about having enough money in your investment portfolio combined with any pension income you may have\nWhere you can do whatever you want with your time you own your time because you can live from your investment income and your other income other income being for example pension income\nSo in the case of Dennis she's combining his pension income and then combining his uh money that he would take from this investment portfolio we talked about an annual rate of withdraw in his case in Dennis case it was a really conservative three percent\nBecause he's a he's not a heavy spender and certainly doesn't sound like he's going to turn into one\nIn addition to that he's got fifty seven thousand dollar pension that he has earned through his hard work through his lifetime and so if he takes another three percent\nIf he rakes off another three percent which is going to be mostly are almost entirely interest dividends and capital gains at that low withdraw rate he's going to have an annual income around Ninety five thousand dollars a year each going and he said he'll be a net saver\n\nBecause that's more than he's making now and he's a living comfortably now so um when we talk about critical mass that's what\nWe're talking about\nLet's be honest we have you ... the expression critical mass from our brothers and sisters and the nuclear community and we have given it a financial life sustainability\nElement of financial critical mass I mean after all that's what it's all about think about it that's the point isn't it the point at which you have an investment portfolio where you can live off of the income for the rest of your life comfortably by properly diversifying you're holding\nThen you're there\nThat's why you throw the alarm clocks out because you don't need 'em anymore because nobody else owns your time but\nYou know if you want to set alarm clock to go fishing at four in the morning that's your business we're not talking about that we're talking about setting an alarm clock to get up to serve the man or whomever [noise]\nPulling your

three\nInsects that would be Victor Amazon money ... money Sierra X ray and would you be able to do is you direct all of the money coming in that way and the money market so that it would be available in liquid form\nFor any withdrawals that you make now I Would only do this if you're planning on making withdrawals out of that account now remember any any withdrawals that you make a prior to your ... your um mandated required minimum distribution\nAny withdrawals that you make her bones Terry and therefore you're voluntarily taking money out to pay tax on it\nAnd you have to ask yourself if you want to do that\nWell the only way I can take money out of it if I don't have the evidence being sent to the money market is to sell shares correct\n\nWell yeah but the ... yeah but I mean that's another thing you can do by the way it's not a big deal but a ... matter is I'd rather do it the other way I'd rather collect interest and dividends on the money put it in a money market fund withdraw that way\nThat's what I intend to do as long as that meets my income these per month than if I needed additional income for what\nOne yeah yeah yeah then I Would liquid then you have to lobby yeah yeah\nOkay I think you've answered my question it's a and I and they do support bad at vanguard they they will put those dividends into a money market for\nI Believe that I Believe that that will I Will be that I think that'll be a simple matter of coding of coding your account appropriately\nYes I Believe that's correct All right Bob thank you very much for it thank you thanks for the call great to hear from Douglas welcome\nBought my question here what these stock\nSince November two thousand seven paying the standard Poor's five hundred as advanced\nBut since then your stock and utility ATF declined and my my question is can you see an insight it related to date the treasury interest rate\nAbsolutely a it is normal for rising interest rates to cause problems for utility stocks and other interest sensitive investments that is a normal occurrence that is something that should be expected\nI also plot or the vanguard of crime and that and in companies and they are not as sensitive to ah changes and interest rate\nAbsolutely not because first of all those are not going to be portfolios that are going to be dominated by utility stocks second of all the growth and the stock market has totally overshadowed any other considerations and those portfolios have done fine\nI I understand that can I get paid back concerning compound interest for younger listeners\nSure\nThough I like to share and I never paid I've never any more shares but Iran still shares have two hundred shares\nJust turn the con entry by reading in the end all those years\nNow how many years are we talking here\nForty three years yeah sure how much did you initially invest\nThey invested six hundred dollars\nAnd seven hundred shares are worth what five\nThousand greater than twenty five thousand today\nYeah well you know what we call it and it's been called this many times compounding return is the eighth wonder of the world and Douglas you just provided more evidence\nAnd I think that's really important for listeners that they should have permission to just like ... and the stock market\nYou are so right Douglas and you know I really appreciate you're bringing this up and I'll tell you why\nYou know I think we all encounter over the course of time we we encounter various ah advertisements and one of the advertisements that just drives me batty is advertisements today trade advertisements to constantly go in and out of the market\nThese these are so damaging Douglas so damaging day by the way they are the opposite of what you're talking about\nI agree with you and thank you so much for taking my call\nNow you know a great talking with you checking in from ...

this and here's one reason I don't understand that it's because well look at it first of all you should be able to itemize your interest right\nRight\nSo you get a tax benefit there and you're also

tax deduction you're paying back super dollars and what's your net worth\nUh about three point four\n[laughter] oh that does it does it I have no interest in this whatsoever you are on your own my friend your on your own\nOr I was not very much\nLike you Brett I'm Sorry I I'm not going to do it net worth three point four million two and seven eight percent loan was seven years to go eighty percent equity in the home\nI'm not ... that alone with your money let alone mine no way no way in the world\nNot going to happen forget about\nForget about\nLet's get Jeremy on the line although Jeremy how little Bob thank you very much for taking my call and I'm just calling I I've been reading an article the\nPensions in other states being under funded and one in in one instance I read a book helpers uh the pins and went from\nPeople having a fifty thousand a year to twenty five thousand a year and I'm Wondering how that could even be possible that someone could take away someone's pension\nI'm to that degree and if your\nAnd one could take away someone's pension I'm to that degree and if you see uh the uh the pension for other states continuing on down that line\nWondering if you first saw that happening nationwide and um it's so to what degree I'm I'm a federal government employee myself and I have a a very small portion of my retirement and pension [noise]\nUm and I don't know if that would affect um [noise] a federal pension\nWell let's talk about the difference okay first of all let's talk about the state pensions All right I don't think it follows that just because Illinois has had problems and just because other states may have had problems I don't think it follows that all fifty states are going to have the same problems\nAnd I'll tell you why because there's something\nAbout this country that it takes a while to appreciate it takes experience and time to appreciate and that is that you have to you have to countries in the United states you have the United states of America which is the federal government you work for\nThat one country but then separate from that you have fifty countries\nWhich are the fifty states right yes\nI think about it they have their own um motor vehicle departments they have their own tax laws\nThey have their own set of laws we have fifty countries fifty separate countries\nRepresented by the fifty states that make up the totality of the United states so we have one country in the United states\nIn that sense although sometimes it's hard to it's hard to find that when you look at at the rich and the divisions there's one country in that sense but they're also fifty countries that they're known as states do you agree Yes sir\nThey all have the all of those fifty states have their own fiscal\nPeculiarities if you will some of them are strong some of those that these states are very well run and their AAA rated some of them some of them are really badly run in fact you just named one of them\nSo ah what that one you ... at one you mentioned the by the way I think has a at a at a parade of governors go to the big house if I'm not mistaken so uh the bottom line and all of this is you have a lot of differences here and I do not believe that all fifty states have to go to financial ruin\nEven though some of already led the way I agree with you some of already led the way\nSo I Would not be concerned that every single state is going to go down the drain\nFrom a financial standpoint that doesn't even matter to you because your pension is a federal pension right\nYes sir I only get thirty percent and the Seventy percent based off the a P S P for savings by\nBut it's all federal but it's not state it's all federal\nYes I understand where you're coming from ... to each each day being basically its own country so if if the state or the country's poorly ran in the pension plan could be possibly a poorly ran and then a could result in something like uh Illinois [noise]\nYeah I mean that's the way that's the way I look at it now I I recognize we have the United states of America and that's one country but I also recognize the obvious which is we have fifty countries represented by each state\nAnd they all have their own motor vehicle department and they all have their own pension plan you all have their own laws in fact some of them have ah\nSome of them have thrown out the federal laws and put in their own laws like look at these states that have made um recreational marijuana legal that's against the federal law right but they they put in their own law and if the federal government decides not to pursue it then there you go\nAnd we see this today and the number of states around the country so the bottom line than all of this is that you have a federal pension so that\nYour pension dollars are going to be a function of the willingness the ability and also the willingness\nOf the federal government to pay your pension so far we have not seen federal pensions in jeopardy\nAnd there is a reason and that differentiates them from the other fifty state pension plans and that is they have a printing press the fifty states don't have one federal government has a printing press\nThe one country printing press US dollar they can print them and they do and as long as they can print them you're probably going to be okay with your federal bench\nThat does not apply to anybody's state pension money talk is about getting yourself into a physician\nManage your own personal financial [noise] that's what it's really all the [noise]\nThis is money to [noise]\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars value some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and then I or a from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now at eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Irish guy call eight five five eight five eight

now for your free author so they should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author somebody should get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nGot it so for what they pay out for what they pay out the percentage or the amount that they do pay out on a get a pension\nI Believe that uh I Believe that if I were in that position I Would expect them to pay out\nOkay you've answered my question\nThey Rob appreciate the call\nGreat to hear from Lincoln I knew someone who um had a family member and immediate family member who are in a very very nice pension working for a company for many many years and the company went bankrupt and\nWhen the company went bankrupt the pension obligation was turned over to the pension benefits guarantee corporation and I was told that the amount of money that was received was\nDifferent less\nThan the amount that would have been paid under the original pension obligation of the company that went bankrupt so these things do happen and a\nThese are corporate pensions now the difference of course when you start telling you about federal pensions as I mentioned earlier we had to call her on that\nAnd in that case in federal pension they do have the printing press any behind their obligations and they're not bashful about using it so that's a plus if you have a federal pension if you have a state pension they don't have a printing press\nSo if you have a state pension you are dependent on the ability of that state to manage their affairs in such a way that they can pay the pension obligations now keep in mind that one of the important aspects of a state paying off pensions\nIs cash flow that depends on taxpayers paying taxes and to the state coffers\nSo it's important for states to remain a a viable and to have a healthy relationship with their tax payers so they can collect those revenues going forward the last thing in the world you want this is the last thing in the world you want make a note on this one put a marker on this one\nThe last thing you want is to have a high level of state pension obligations and liabilities\nAnd have tax payers leaving your state that is the makings of a fiscal train wreck state has\nHigh patch has a high pension liabilities I future pension payouts and has a population that on net is leaving the state that's a disaster new making right there Ellen's on the line in Illinois hello Ellen\nHow much I I don't think that the get straight answers what I did a quiet rates were very high I bought it and they're at seven point five percent\nNow their amount of like three thousand thousand seven thousand left any potential\nBut every time interest rates go up\nThe market value goes down to I like them\nHow much do have invested in these\nTwenty thousand thirty\nAnd what is your network what is your net worth about ... million\nI'd twenty to thirty thousand or the million dollar net worth in this situation keep in mind that you are collecting interest at a high rate on a regular basis correct\nCorrect\nFor that reason I Would simply hold on to these\nTiny try to eat\nWell here's the reality they're paying you a very very high level of interest correct\nCorrect\nAnd if you do sell them you're going to have to reinvest that money at much much lower interest rates you're going to get way lower rates correct\nCorrect what's the point of that\nWell see I didn't know what the market value with me and I couldn't get it\nWell the market the market value on news is going to de grade as interest rates go up just as it has been at the same time if you sell these which you can do your then going to have to ah reinvest that money and you're going to get a really low interest rate at today's rates now\nI don't think so in other words in other words for you you can hold on to them and\nLook at them on a total returned basis you're getting ridiculously high rates of interest\nWhy anybody would hold onto a mortgage at eight percent or seven and a half percent the only reason they would do it is because they don't have the money to pay it off that's the only reason they would do it and you're benefiting from that by collecting that interest at the same time if you sell these and reinvest look at what you're going to get\nWhat ... very low right right but then I thought well maybe\nI mean what would you what would you do if you were ... let's just do a hypothetical let's say you were to sell these which you can do you could sell them let's say you seldom what would you do with the money\nI\nReinvest that money is to decide to take money out of Jenny Maes to put it in the stock market and that's a totally different question but if you take a look right now what's out there fully insured FDIC and she CDs their ... two and a half percent\nSo I I think what's going to happen to you is if you sell these\nAnd I don't even know if these are in a taxable to count you may even have to pay a capital gain on a principle appreciation sounds like you would in taxable to count she might have a capital gain liability\nFor the for the federal government maybe also for Illinois [noise] [noise] so I mean I think you're going to find a you're going to find either way\nIt's going to be very very difficult to come out measurably ahead meaningfully ahead but especially because this represent such a tiny portion of you\nIn your head but especially because this represents such a tiny portion of your network\nRight well that I just want it to make here and I couldn't get it straight answer you couldn't believe it\nOkay I just don't see a big deal one way or the other ...\nAnd I appreciate it how much bad because I couldn't get it straight my mind I just quit your way ahead of a broker the bank in the pond and everything so thank you so much a\nNice recall Neal good to hear from you\nKnow I mean it's always complicated when you're talking about Jenny Maes it's even more complicated when your own ... percent interest [laughter] I mean that's a big rig right that's a really big rate\nAnd are they looking a tremendous amount of interest relative to what's out there are not very competitive do an eight percent and you may even if the prices degrading\nPatios on the line and California Patty welcome to the program\nI'm taking my call up and you invest dirt\nAnd I could get in on her kissing that John Paul but you recommend a ... fan but I just read your new your market timer and it very interesting and I'm like you know what\nI Would start in bed and I'm ... I'm going to be ... and I think maybe that\nLet me ask you a question ... let me ask you a question Patty you mentioned a a really good book by John Bogle which is on our recommended readings listed in the book suction above Brinker dot com one of my favorites is called common sense on the actual funds congratulations on getting that book but I wanted to ask you have you read the book\n[noise] kids uh I think maybe that first second chapter only I Would actually I bought it I'm really into it I just think late at night I only just started\nI'm going to ask you I'm going to ask before you start investing I'm going to ask you to complete the book\nWonder I can do that and it ... I Love it already it's great\nYeah the ... you know just everything you bring\nIt on Bogle John Bogle has been a multiple times just on the broadcast a John Bogle is what are the best things that ever happened to investors\nGreat well I'm excited I Love I Love it All right um but I get my home and I agree that very first one\nAnd I think I in in that model you know quite how you and that they're like the the\nWell the way you would invest in a again I really want you to complete that book before you start but uh the ... the way you invest is um you can notice for example that a lot of those funds or One Fund family\nSo the way to investors to contact that uh to get started a as an initial step is to contact that fun family oh which has a number of funds in there\nAnd ah you get started there uh it depends on how much money are investing but you can get started there if you wanted to just get started initially with the minimum ... a lot of those funds you'll notice heaven initial minimum investment requirement of only three thousand dollars\nBut bring er here it's the talk [noise]\nMoney talks [noise]", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "28"}
