keep their majority Democrats could also pick up seats from the G O P in Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable or borrow from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked up nine\nDonald Trump didn't win a single state according to the polls\nJohn Kerry was going to be president because of

is always welcome to visit you know my friend David showed on this program has been to the tree of life says rabbi Myers is an amazing man\nAnd um\nSays rabbi Myers is an amazing man\nAnd um\nWhy wouldn't you want the president to come and comfort your congregation there's never been a more pro Israel president in my lifetime than this one it's just it's just the fact\nAll these presidents promised that Jerusalem which is the rightful capital of Israel owe that to move it from Tel Aviv Israel then they never do it because they never have the courage to do what a Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the ... region\nThey said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my word\nOh why don't we have a little bit more of that\nThat is one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word is gonna he's fighting for it we see now happening on the immigration fight\nOr the president and a Lindsey Graham of teamed up to end birthright citizenship in other words if you enter the country illegally and you happen to give birth to a child that child instantly\nEven though you're in the country illegally interest in it initially is just automatically a U.S citizen doesn't matter that your parents are here illegally\nWell that is only to encouraging other illegal behavior we're asking people we support immigration legal immigration we now see caravan organizers ... illegal migrants on the buses headed for the U.S\nAlthough some of the people now have been turning back\nUm the Pentagon now is deployed over fifty two hundred troops they're putting up barriers ... barbed wire and other things because we can't have what happened on the southern border with Guatemala Mexico Mexico southern border where people just rush across and Russia over the police\nYou know we had apparently a confrontation yesterday one dead dozens injured\nAs a caravan was clashing with Mexican authorities we don't want that here we are saying if you want to come then come legally don't come illegally respect America First thing to getting into America has to be respect America the sovereignty respect our borders respect to America is\nUm\nThis is getting interesting about Robert mall I don't really know what to think about it I'm a little torn about even talking about it but apparently Mike Allen let's see if I can pull this story up here is a tweeting out that special counsel former FBI Director Mueller is accused of\nSome type of sexual impropriety\nAgainst women and the FBI now is looking into it that it's a false story so I Want to give you both sides of it daily news as of a very different take on it\nAnd they're headline is FBI asked to investigate allegations that women were offered cash to accuse Robert Mueller of sexual assault\nI Know for a fact\nThat a tape exists or where there is a very prominent person\nOn the tape on about Mueller very prominent person on the tape offering money to somebody to make allegations against Donald Trump why this tape has never been made public I don't know but it does exist\nAnd I'm not going to go any further than that at this point so this type of thing does happen\nAnd I think like every other case\nI mean I'm not a fan of the team that Robert Mueller put together I you know I'm always torn goes I never want to credit you I'm I'm very fond of law enforcement I just hate the people that he hired in this witch hunt\nHow we ever got off into things like you know bank loan applications when it was supposed to be about Trump Russia collusion you know we're at a point in history where\nThis is how phony Democrats are they only care about Russia collusion and interference if it's Donald Trump but when you have real evidence 'cause there's no evidence of Trump Russia collusion\nWhen there's real evidence of Hillary paying for a pony Russian dot CA disseminated by top intelligence officials and FBI officials to lie to the American people before an election is used to commit fraud\nOn Pfizer court judges four times to get into the Trump campaign ... be a Trump campaign associate and then is part of a media elite strategy that we've now learned about it's taken Eighteen months\nThat ... is used in legal all over the media to create the impression oh there's smoke here about Trump Russia collusion but the leaks were about the phony dusty a Russian does save and Hillary paid for on top of of course Hillary committed multiple felonies\nAnd having a rigged investigation and this week strategy leading to the appointment of Mahler which we now know to be the insurance policy just in case Trump wins because Trump should lose a hundred million to one according to Peter Struck even Peter Struck said there's no there there\nAre you still paid said ... just prior to the appointment of Mahler they had no evidence of any type of type of collusion none\nIt's outrageous\nYou know you watch this this vile anti Semitic racist Trump hater murdering a Lebanon innocent people injuring six others I mean you see it's basically the face of evil\nEvil exists it exist in\nSociety exist all around the world why we need to spend the money we spend on a strong national defense that's why we need to be tough with oh Kim Jong un and the mullahs in Iran you know it's we had the deadliest attack against the Jewish community on American soil in our history\nPresident said no will destroy you if you attack them which was the right answer is no place in this country for evil racist anti Semite none\nI don't think there's been a president in modern history that has demonstrated his support for our number one ally\nIn the middle east and frankly between Great Britain in Israel but this is the closest alliance we have as America founded on Judeo Christian principles it's a personal connection in his own family with his daughter and son in law\nIs grandchildren you know as um you know he's the one that deported the Nazi death camp guard Obama didn't do it could have but he didn't spend the most pro\nIsraeli president rightly so since Nineteen forty seven moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has presidents never had the courage to do it\nIsraeli prime minister or I've often said was the only adult on the world stage finally has a partner that understands the evils and the threats of radical Islam and\nEspecially Iran and the mainstream media Democrats speaking with one voice blame Trump\nBut this horrific attack Dana Milbank writing Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews what a lie what a slander is disgusting despicable lie\nAlso in the Washington Post an editor writing you know Trump is stoked the fears of those like power\nColumnist the New York times Trump is flirted with the deepest racist the Nazis and it is not gone unnoticed elites\nFlirted with the deepest racist the Nazis and it is not gone unnoticed the least\nOf all by them blaming the president now not only is Trump historically since forty eight the most supportive president\nOf Israel and the Jewish community the monster that committed this evil atrocity in the synagogue a happen to have Trump\nWhy because Trump is so close with our friends and allies of Israel and Bowers posting online is hatred and contempt for Trump because of its support for Israel but yet the mainstream media's coverage that doesn't matter\nAt one you know CNN and ... you know GQ correspondent saying that the president is worse than ISIS I think you know that's\nOne of the things that ... really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rat on radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I separate dad I think the president has far more supporters hailed it as an equally hateful ideology and CNN\nAnd it's unbelievable she says well my comments or ... that's all we've heard all weekend\nAnd then you get fake news president Jeff Zucker lecturing the president on rhetoric and civility this

time occasionally\nThey said yeah it's natural I think the issue we've had is Lake Okeechobee the Army Corps of engineers discharges\nFeminist polluted water into the rivers and so like who's the ... river goes into the area where you where you live in South Florida and I think what happened with some of those nutrients mixed with the red tide and exacerbated so we we got it bad that was already got a really really bad at all I'm committed to making sure that we're batting that\nStopping the discharge is that in order to do that you gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnerships I'll be able to do that you'll want to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with them on any of that I think any of those problems we have and\nWhat I understand it's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess it in the early part of the spring and summer this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I'm not quite frankly Michael washed I'm a bit um you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really\nYeah there was a two month stretch there in southwest Florida where people were just

could be the tipping point one week from today\nWell I tell people all the time you know Southern California is a is the hot spot right now and it's it's because uh you know two people that are looking to be speaker or in the next session are from California\nAnd uh so they're looking at these seats but I I actually think we're going to do well I really do I think maybe showing well I think Dan is doing well [noise] um it's it's going to come down to the candidate though that's going to have to pull it through for themselves um yeah a lot of money is coming in and there's been a lot of

never seen anything like it in my life\nSo corrupt Shawn he tried so corrupt\n[laughter] these calls and I'm One of the times one sector live calling I don't think that it I I think that it's cute based on who's you know answering the phone don't want it to Pennsylvania one on a computer right now do on the extreme in a district for ... ...\nThere's no one answer is no one else has all skew towards down close to Philadelphia I think it's Patrick ... rates [noise] I'm\nNot sure exactly what you say explain that again you think the ... or an accurate I agree OK\nYeah and I think it's just based on results or cause a lot of the strict for the first is a most Republican voters in the northern stuffed northeast section right\nOn the border with New York right\nRight I Want to answer the phone after it's all students towards the bottom towards Philadelphia\nOh that's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and you know look everywhere here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live I we are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota raises California races\nBut the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection\nWell we need a majority but it doesn't have to be a big majority but if you can win the majority and pick up the Senate seats I think we can pick up hold the Senate seats that need to be held\nThen it could be a very good night one week from now but I Am telling everybody gets in my opinion right now Republicans plus three for the Senate data and three senators but I also would say that in the house I'd say it's probably on paper looking a poll paper\nAnd I'm hesitant to say this but\nJust analyzing the races analyzing all of the new candidates you know forty five retirements in this time I'm ... I Would say it's ... it's it's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with a toss up because\nRight now the Democrats have two hundred and five locked in races for the house the Republicans two hundred and now the problem is the toss ups or almost all Republican so you're gonna have to run the table on those\nWe put all that information the most important in the top thirty that we picked then identified it's easily you know\nYou can find that easily at ... dot com\nYeah so I don't know I'm looking at it I made like a toss up right now Michael shit I'm of a toss up that I mean I have it with a toss up on and be three to locate one Ninety two but a lot of these sheets on\nLook let me give you one anecdotal piece of evidence we know one twenty sixteen that the exit polls show and all the polls leading up to the election showed Donald Trump wasn't going to win\nAnd the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and it said he lost everything Florida gun North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin gone and the same thing happened to two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president\nJust to two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen or in a midterm if we go back member twenty fourteen it was for cast as a close Senate race but the GOP one nine Senate seats\nI mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize that if you don't want Nancy Pelosi speaker\nIf you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do in your power at the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house\nThat's the best case scenario one is a split decision they gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker the worst case scenario it Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen right now the ... they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends whether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress\nDo you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or we're going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment\nWe're going to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats\nAre we going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on healthcare on the Democratic side I'm like you're the same people that ruined the health care system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats vote for polo see any Democratic Senate vote as a boat for sure\nThat we should have a pretty good night a week from now but the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide anyway um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program\nWe're going to get a little into

every year and set of eyes yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money but when you get older if you really get sick\nThat money that account is built up a fortune

stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting there is ... and we don't want those people managing our health care\nEvery American deserves Affordable Care and the direct care model cars\nManager for a penny a pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no co pays brief procedures we can fix is we can um work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease savings yeah their premiums by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in office\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back or a an Affordable Care act dial a Medicare for all it would decrease our ability to really you know innovate in a way that is meaningful for patient\nAnd more importantly shot you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled socialized medicine or you're going to inserts that government between patients and their doctors\nOr you think of the capital here you know that's how the ... at the same government that's going to control your health care or you have a another position that his health care freedom and he's with the freedom of choice between you and your physician\nAre worth your decisions are not being made by the ...\nBy by the government and so in a while direct primary care is is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been graced by most Republicans that are running including a fantasy is running for governor in the state of Florida he is a race this weekend which has put this in his you know to direct primary care and his platform\nAh so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom this is definitely the vision for him\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be honest but I could pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care and get a doctor's recommendation\nAnd didn't and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to these stock in the box places and I'm not now playing them like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities\nBut I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nYou and everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom\nAnd we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care\nSo this really is a crucial step in history where we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and met our ten dollars a pill we we want freedom and health care we want choice the direct care model\nAllows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way\nI'm Sean ours you know it shouldn't be of\nCourse it you know in our practice we have not raised our prices and eight years we've heard sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services\nAre X rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so a pre existing no pre existing condition the question is can you actually afford to get the care unique by the doctor you need when you need a and these direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship\nCan actually do that so you need to embrace of the people that are running for office that support freedom in health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with the Republicans 'cause they had promised repeal replace and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit\nHe got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have we're gonna have better health care options for the American people but in many cases that the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare\nYou're offering a health care cooperative model you duplicate it down how many practices across the country Dr amber\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get launched but there's over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty ... started last month alone that's a new practice every business day\nThe ... and then you have any direct access every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor there are no pre existing condition prejudice at all these practice\nAccess to a doctor there are no pre existing condition prejudice at all and these practices exactly have you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care there\nIs no insurance except you probably would want a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which a fairly inexpensive owner\nYou have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know a point that goes unmentioned is the fact that he's insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent of review and ... and I never raised her prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nGood I'm not trying to be noisy but are you making at fifty bucks a patient I'm I I I make a monthly you making any money\n[laughter] that's what we're going to be married and has been acquired yeah yeah\nI mean this has not been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices afloat or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospital are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's worked ...\nSaint poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out what is the pack and pay above the Z pack\n... yet they should be able to get I think about it the poor and ... the more you need amuck like this they might treated a study on Oregon's Medicaid system in only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient\nDon't believe that have a functioning current car insurance gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are\nAnd how many patients you have a we have about six or seven hundred productive\nOkay look all the way and I was just like those practices probably most of your patients like me\nI really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know say let's go fishing together hum this most people drink but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice where they're calling you every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our high ... in our lives\nAre we at her high we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stops you know we factored that in um the only part of the\nProgram we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land up this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after this so now with or a thousand practices nationwide already practicing the director model\nOur looking increase that just by thirty percent with one conference alone or the interest is massive will keep growing and as long as we put policies were placed the state and federal level that continue to allow these practice to to grow and blossom or you'll see this movement weaving all across the country are getting better access better care for the cost\nOf a sudden I got to tell you any Democrat that is telling you anything about healthcare that's out now is they're talking point we're offering healthcare a ... and Republicans will take take care of preexisting conditions they're lying ... Boulder lie as keep your doctor keep your plan and save money\nAnd why would you trust the people that burns you the first time so that's their talking point in the final week of the election and these alternatives ah assuming Republicans get the Senate and hopefully the house which is a lot tighter um it would be an opportunity for them to adopt this model and every American could I've concierge care at lower rates and we'd all be better off", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "College Station", "day": "30"}
