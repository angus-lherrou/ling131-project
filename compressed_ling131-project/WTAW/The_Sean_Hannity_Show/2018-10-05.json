step forward to maybe say that\nThe biggest winner of the speeches the judiciary because her as a wholesale attack on the independence of the judiciary one at all costs what you saw the day was a person embracing the rule of law not the rule of the mob what you saw today was a woman\nNot being intimidated what you saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being save a strong woman which you saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country\nAnd I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward\nBut this is as close to McCarthyism is our hope for witness in my life\nAnd if anybody turned it around and it was senator Collins\nAh you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came\nWhen they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh I don't think any of us will forget anytime soon\nThe things that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that remember the accusation by Julie sweat neck was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that that judge Kavanaugh and others\nWere routinely drug in girls lining up in halls gang raping\nThem and it happened frequently and I I Know that some people brought up the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night\nHow was one supposed to act if you're innocent to the charge of drugging teenage girls and participating in gang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but I Would think if you're innocent it\nIs one of deep anger and and the frustration Eighteen days ago nobody thought any of those the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well yeah I think I think most Americans saw a man who was fighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this went through a logical explanation are based on a calendar that are very few people in the world case except him and his dad\nAnd just a warning to everybody know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life I'm not evil and I I think he reacted consistently been innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here when the sweat Nick allegation came out it was breaking news allegation number three at a very new and\nEvil level right so I thought I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party\nOr where people were drugged and raped and go to too much less than that made no sense a call ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah Susan is going to be this way for a while to come\nRead it here's my take on it and being in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge this doesn't have the ring of truth she said you know that makes sense followed anybody to keep going back and putting themselves in that situation and the friends not tell anybody and you've got to remember is ...\nAnd she worked through the process you took teach allegation on its own she went to all the major decisions that judge Kavanaugh and spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a ... every I think they should be in every civics class in the country every high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins\nExplanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election and thirty two days to me senator or look\nAt your when Senator or I I Know how close you were to Senator McCain right and who recently passed away and I always admired him for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for president in oh wait over bronco Obama\nIt was the right decision then and I stand by the day\nI had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated\nAnd I remember he said that how these people on radio and TV and you know I understood Senator McCain that's you know he kind of had that side of the home and I knew it really well\nUm but he also talked in that speech to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last the teen days political is down to the ballot box\nI mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habits are the best thing you can do to stop this and the futures deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats they won't power too bad if what it says and say\nListen I I you know went through the record the allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape the serial sexual predator he is\nHonor in terms of him being some kind of gang rape the serial sexual predator he is a very reason logical judge I looked at everything they said about him I compared it to the facts and I'm voting yes here's what I Want the voters to do\nOn the voters to remember what the Democratic Party will do to get power\nAnd that they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remember this America do you really want these people in charge of your government\nWell I think that's a great question you know there's something you mentioned earlier I saw I I'd never known Susan Collins that well I Know that look look the Republican Party is not a model out for dinner\nIf you want to and I love\nTo I I I found somebody today that I had no idea that the federal ... under which she makes her decisions and I called back time\nI respect I ... I really have a deep respect I Want everybody to have their own mind I'm not even a Republican I'm a conservative for reasons that I Hope passionate and deer\nBut you mentioned something earlier that this was a profile in courage for her right in as much as we you've been outside in the halls in the Senate and you see what's going on there and all the protesting\nAnd Maine is not exactly an a an expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and\nInfluence or and groups are pledging now to to vote her out of office in destroying her and I'm like did anybody listen to what\nSenator calls just said that anybody want to listen I don't think anybody wanted to hear what she said because it was the single most\nThorough case for for how any\nSenator or congressman should make a decision\nAgain a good example for civics class to look at it in terms of way senator should act but let's talk about the politics for a moment [noise] okay I talk a lot about ... only because I've tried to save the system\nYou know you always have ... votes but I mean I Know but but no you more they made up for it\n... I don't think I had anything to make up for I really ... for you to disagree with me I'm not going to run my life around being somebody\nI'm not going to end my life around what the hell Hannity things no way that are now going to\nBe honest with you I'm going to be true to me aren't you truly you\nYes or Leno wouldn't look like anything that\nSusan Collins she's a moderate pro choice Republican from New England that represents a party a that used to exist in New England in greater numbers\nShe is a fiscal conservative she voted for the tax bill she's a social moderate and she will do things you won't like in the future but whatever she does will be thought out and reasoned\nBut here's why I appreciate you talking about Susan Collins today she has come as close to anybody in my lifetime of saving the republic\nFrom the abyss because we're headed down where nobody even want to be a judge in the future if Susan had legitimize this God help the Senate confirmation\nPrior to ... she said it it's been in a rapid decline for Thirty years they're trying to but I've got a new senator um okay I don't think this would happen I don't think I don't I didn't reshaped\nThat but I I'm going to do something without ... just just for a second okay I'm going to send me on every or another politician do probably\nUh I'm fine uh you know I'm fine uh if you can ... and help says they're going to try to destroy her now she comes from a purple state\nA President Trump last name a few points he wanted to second congressional district the main politics are different than they are in South Carolina and she was not about main herself she was about America\nShe represents the best of Margaret Chase Smith of a history of of Maine and if you really don't be fooled she's a moderate she's not a Sean Hannity conservative\nShe's a moderate but she loves the country and she's got more guts and most politicians and her little finger than most everybody I Know in my district she's not afraid so helper Sean till you're ... years to help her they're killing our financial\nSenator helper I I was so blown away by that speech I Would absolutely recommend that people help her she she did something to she is leveled the playing field them brought a voice of sanity well thought out intellectual constitutional\n\nIt Fox News alerts a turning point in the U.S Senate and the Brady confirmation now considered likely for the Supreme Court nominee\nWho picked up two crucial votes today\nMade Republican Susan Collins up through a link the floor speech includes she will vote in favor of judge Brett Kavanaugh for a Supreme Court seat\nThe allegation fail to me the more likely than not standard\nColon says a presumption of innocence plus a lack of corroboration means sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh do not barely prevent him from serving on the court shortly after Collins made her announcement another undecided\nFairly prevent him from serving on the court shortly after Collins made her announcement and other undecided Senate or West Virginia Democrat Joe mansion said he too will vote for Kevin all both announcements likely secure enough support for Kavanaugh before Saturday confirmation vote\nFox's Geron helper and on Capitol Hill where protesters have been keeping up the pressure\nOn him\nCamping outside Collins' office others confronting mansion [noise]\nThat the White House is praising Collins show is former President George H W.

them often now thirty two days out of election day and I think the most important midterms in our lifetime of John McLaughlin Doug shown or whether it's All right Doug predictions what's gonna happen\nI think is going to be confirmed you will have the Republicans holding the Senate or narrowly and the Democrats winning the house but was thirty plus thirty bucks wow\nThat's a huge production for the Democrats um I don't think there's any scenario that I could discount thirty two days out of this election I think anything can happen and I hope the American people see what they were electing and Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest told John McLaughlin\nI think you're right and uh uh in terms of its just four weeks out over four weeks ago all I can happen\nBut I Will tell you that the key thing is Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to bear but it is voters are coming back out but the key thing is\nIs to real opponents right now or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer he needs to take them on they're going to be a nightmare if they get control either house\nUh uh for next year so we've got to do is support with national survey ahead of fifty five percent unfavorable rating I mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate but it's too early on the house\nAnd and prior to cabinet looked like we were going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy\nFor her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection he needs to take on every day about them roll wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders having having a back to the elites where the swap runs the country again\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick up Senate seats\nAlright thank you both John McLaughlin and dug shown eight hundred number one Sean toll free telephone number will continue we'll have our Florida

we're seeing now or the fake activist who are getting the street I remember when I was ...\nSaying now are the fake activists who are hitting the street I remember when I was president a bear and I'm going to disclose this that there were times when we were ... load up and buses full of activists by simply giving 'em ten dollars in a tuna fish sandwich and a drink to get on the bus to go protest something that they\nHad no clue what it was that they were going to protest and that's what you're saying on the streets now and that\nIs fake it is something that will not stop freedomworks the

vote we want cabin ought to come through last week\nFreedomworks we had two thousand people on the Capitol Grounds pushing through not only Jim Jordan who I can be the next speaker of the house but also we wanted those elected officials who should be responsible\nTo the American people for the opposite they old to make sure that they go and do the job that we sent them to do it's a long way from when I was president of the N. double ACP twenty seven years ago\nTo where I Am now and that plantation that Reverend Peterson was talking about the jets the lady was talking about by the way Jesse leaves in my movie runaway slave or just we want why am\nI not in your movie what's up with\nYou and I have to make the next film together Sean we have to make the next I don't know I'm\nJust wondering why you picked Jesse and you didn't pick your friends Sean Hannity\nYou're good buddy you got to come on the show real so what that plantation was real I grew up in that same Jim Crow era it's very real but many of us have run away from it\nAnd we encourage many more at this point in time in America and the president is giving us all the caliber that's necessary to run away from that type of sleep but that this nation that following up under\nYou know to add to that and the beauty of what President Trump as John that\nBecause the lack fear he's put country first he's not afraid to really deal with the people he's not afraid to use social media to put the truth out there and just credit is encourage it a lot of men and women especially those are good to stand up and speak\nA fight for their country fight for what is right and when they saw this attack a judge Kavanaugh his wife\nHis daughters while they're saying that they care about women care about children we're to love and compassion for the judge and his wife his children are going to have to deal with these allegations\nThis whole thing has to now look we've got to get through the vote tomorrow and I am cautiously optimistic that judge Kavanaugh gets to be on the court that he deserves to be on\nWhat if we don't deal with the these tactics the willingness to tear down bludgeon destroy men\nFamilies kids are obviously impacted by it if if they can't even have the the most simple as the civility on these issues you know the American people need to see it no it get it understand it embrace what they would be voting for it's horrible you know destroying people it's horrible how many more people have to go through a Clarence\nThomas judge Kavanaugh Robert Bork how many Republicans are falsely
