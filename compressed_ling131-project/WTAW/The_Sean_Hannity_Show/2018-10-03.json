futures for kids and grandkids is not complicated but politicians that wind power may get complicated\nWell that's exactly right and I don't understand why my the the other side just doesn't want the same thing that doesn't make any sense\nOr I currently you hold on the ship until I got an opportunity to be back down there in Charleston to say Hi to everybody thank you so much for being with us a can is in palm coast Florida next on the Sean Hannity show Ken how are you welcome to the sewer swamp known as your nation's capital\nSean I used to live in Arizona actually lived up in a town called snowflake and it's funny how you call just snowflake but that is a real town in\nEvery ... wow\nYeah it's it it's a two two members that started the town or something snow in something flake and they named the town's snowflake in uh when I Lived up there and I lived in Arizona I had the head to vote for\nBoth ... flake and John McCain\nAnd I used to call him when I Lived back there and I would tell them all the time I had to hold my nose to vote for you and it's up to you to hold your nose\nTo vote for you know what I was ... whatever's going on at the time and now I'm saying the same thing that Jeff Flake I did help him get elected and I would wish he would just hold his nose and support the president he doesn't have to like what do you know the president which we all know he doesn't\nBut he should at least support the people that elected him and they're not well let's remember what\nHe said it remember what he said in sixty minutes on Sunday night he said well would it was asked would you be able to vote this way if you are facing the voters these Scott absolutely not which means I'm only at doing this because I don't have\nTo face the voters again otherwise I Would just do what was politically expedient so now I'll do what I Want to do that's basically what he said\nYeah but when he was even in back then when when he was you know a vicious I've been out of every one for a couple of years\nHe he missed major votes that we needed him on one was when he was home with his daughter at some dance recital and another one he went through his son's wedding and he said that you know the heat plant this was planned a long time ago and he wasn't going to miss it sounds wedding\nWell who in the Senate would say okay if you're going to get married get married why we're in session you know he he he didn't have a chance I I probably I had a hard time even and I called him in and really hard time being played I always was played for the people I talked to and I always wish them a good weekend\nBut he he had been a disappointment\nFor years and years and years he's he's just a it's a good thing is going away hopefully I think the only thing he's going to do is run at a Democrat and you might see that happening\nWell I Will tell you the Arizona is have a choice I Am very impressed with this woman Martha ... salad\nUm she's a war hero and it's it's interesting she's going up against somebody that apparently is a bit of a resistor and\nAndme was outspoken against the war the\nThe base salary was out there fighting so that's going to be an important raised Arizona's a pretty ... polish states right now and but I Will tell you it's going to make a difference of Republicans win that seat if Dean Heller can hang on in Nevada and if Joe Donnelly is gone and Heidi Heitkamp is gone and Claire McCaskill is gone and\nAnd Joe Manchin and Bill Nelson are all gone I mean it won't be any problem with future Supreme Court\nNominees President Trump and the next two years old and we might not be able to get a lot more things done altogether but anyway I've got to run I appreciate the call thank you for being with us or want to get some other calls in here a guy is in well let's go to Kimberly in Connecticut Kimberly Hi how are you glad you called\nHow are you I'm good how are you I'm hearing now you know I met this girl Alice in Connecticut and I'm
