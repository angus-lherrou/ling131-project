McConnell and his wife some guy\nBanging part or based on his table prone as food out either or Ted Cruz being run out with his wife out of a restaurant\nI don't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability um I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore either I'm sure you agree with me right\n[laughter] I mean\nI'm asking do you agree with that\nWas simple question because no one answer\nBecause he hung up to harder question Craig you have thirty seconds Greg\nGo\nAhead Greg real quick oh hey John great cast to listen to the big big on her um I was blessed enough to go to be a rally out here in Houston and it was just amazing to hear President Trump speaking person\nA skinny so much hope because my sister brought my little nephew and a Thirteen year old kid hung on every single word that a President Trump had to say and joining read about that\nGetting if didn't their faces this is their\nRhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened to the ball field in ... nearly lost his life um and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters it turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one nut that supports him you know decided to become violence\nIs outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been their silence has been deafening in recent months and days\nUh anyways Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action and also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris\nKobach who's back with us and uh he has penned a piece on them migrant caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration and ah by the way it's been very successful and what he's doing and\nUh and uh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas who was a big win that you pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of Kansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you'd be a great governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated\nUnwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately um but if they in four weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush ... across that border as in as one\nWe don't have any pro choice we will have to arrest them that will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens you know meanwhile you got governors\nAh like a Governor Brown out in California giving more so if it's a federal and state response or the feds have to build the wall and they have to stop panning out the goodies which gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so you while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but\nLet's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government that they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling aren't capable of doing so ah what should America's response be\nWell I think America's response exactly what the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country\nWhy they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons or to either harm is or the day you know but there's a variety in the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is to protect his people in the president's made very clear and and the one thing I said that the other day to sell in China I Want to be clear your agree with me I Know\nChris will agree as well don't temp Donald Trump\nTemp temp because he's warned them Mexican Government is warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I guess I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means it there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse course\nI mean let me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I and I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people people that don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families\nI Believe a lot of the age we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch\nFor anybody in that care of him\nNobody can vouch for anybody and it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people\nTo allow people in ... no idea what their their point of view a worldview happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWell and that's ... that's a very good point you know it'd be there's abundant evidence of terrorists using\nThe traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border to get into the United states\nGoing all the way back to before nine eleven ah people from countries where al ... was active now countries where I suspect active have used this this flow this Margaret close to blend in there's no question that that will be the case again\nYou know the other thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is I think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just to follow the for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats are were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigrant reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here legally then then the two thousands they became crow amnesty and they no longer wanted to deport they want to grant amnesty eleven million plus year\nNow they're taking the position that we weren't there cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten\nThey want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous ... people before they're even here to become unlawfully present in the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump\n... let me switch gears to these packages the president said um he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror he said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages that appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down and the and the whole force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do\n'em both before that Shawn we've seen a lot leading up to this and what ... what have we seen we've been witnessing sent\nOne quick question they cause I think you're making an excellent point one last thing it only takes one\nAnd that that leads into what we're talking about today you you can have Ninety nine point nine percent B. B. B. doing the right thing but it only takes one to do the wrong thing and I think that's what we need to remember to this whole process we saw that today one person or however many we don't know is now frightening and terrorizing thousands and thousands of people [noise]\nUm and and you know I'm not making any action but while I'm at the point that I'm making it it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people who were safely but if we don't protect to get a hundred percent right people can be threatened her and I that's the thing that we have to make sure that we're clear on\nI Will tell you what when when the quake quake on this will come back on the other side and talk about the president's comments he they will hunt down those people that have been sending these suspicious packages\nAnd powder and potential pipe bombs are two very politicians want to CNN or this is not new I've lived through this myself\nAt uh one of my assistance at the time poorly Sabbath was in isolation what was that the window what eight nine ten hours one day scared to death yeah it was horrible it was horrible because she opened up a letter sent to me with white powder in it\nThat's happened to Don junior and his family we saw the shooting which beliefs but we've been watching this ratchet up left wing rhetoric has been insane and we've heard nothing but crickets from the Democrats will get to that All right so you know what a big fan of liberty safe I Am they are the number one safe manufacturer right here in the u._s._a.\nAnd they've sold millions of their safe for good reason and I own liberty safe long before there were advertisers\nBecause it's the best built safe on the planet they lead the industry and technology innovation they offer exclusive features like their military style locking bars and heat expanding fire seals that are second to none\nBy the way you can get installation as well plus all of their full size safe Nick over the lifetime warranty and liberty saved truly makes it a beat herbal products\nAnd you can count on them to protect the things that matter to you most in other words oh things like uh your important papers your valuables firearms things that you want to make sure nobody has the ability to get a hold up in this month liberty safe is offering some exciting promotions\nNow they are having their Franklin Stein event you can save hundreds on liberties customer favorite Franklin series and I have that\nAnd plus you can save our liberties exclusive reaper series save job yet cash jewelry documents important papers firearms you want to protect from thieves or fire or you want to keep your family safe\nWell they have the perfect perfect antidote and that was the best time to become a liberty said Boehner twelve months interest refinancing on approved credit and check out all their special deals at liberty safe dot com just go to their website liberty save\nDot com you won't regret it [noise]\nShaun guide more behind the scenes for\nMore contacts in any\nMore friends behind\nSean Hannity is on [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval\n\nThis is a Fox News alerts a string of suspicious devices stocks\nHumbling and the ... uh recap on Wall street in a moment first the latest on the package it sent a multiple locations including a CNN office in Manhattan but mainly appearing to target ...

Bredesen of Tennessee in his staff caught on tape while the they think the people of Tennessee are ignorant and they had no problem saying yeah he's only saying that he's voting for cabinet he would never vote for Kavanaugh\nHe's just saying that to get elected then you'll get there he'll be is a liberal they'll do the right thing\nWe had a similar situation in Missouri was Claire McCaskill directly or own words and she's ... she is as liberal as Brock Obama but she's hiding her positions as relates to Planned Parenthood the second amendment what do I keep saying Democrats can't run on what they really want to run on so they were on on Trump paid\nThey try to be quiet tell Maxine don't talk about impeaching forty five the center for American Progress as they don't talk about immigration why because they want sanctuary cities states open borders the elimination of ice\nOr so they want the crumbs back they want to keep Obamacare and that's their full agenda but they're not saying it in the hopes that people will say well maybe we'll just give these guys would try and not know a thing about what they're real agenda is well this is going to play for you now we go to North Dakota where project very tough cameras went undercover yet again\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something I'm Sean if it's wrong for me to go undercover and record these folks\nAnd how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that are happening North Dakota this week\nYou know I think well that should've happened in North Dakota I mean if she's planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know 'em why can't you do it in Pennsylvania and twelve other states\nThere's twelve states that prohibit what they call to party consent laws and I think that these laws basically it means that uh you know if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North Dakota and misery already hearty consent\nAs long as I'm with you I can record you know I think these laws are unconstitutional I think they do to fight the guilty and I also think Sean they give the guilty away out\nThey give them a way out they give them

story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left and a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so I'm a great to be on thank you um so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I consider myself while I was the Democratic party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia had been telling me for months and months at\nA Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also have been telling me for months and months that he was a racist in a big ... and ... and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers were no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people making people believe these stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I I'll never be able to understand how people can vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability\nAnd it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen I'm\nJust asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch this compilation\nIs that this is a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now ... but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really\nRealized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that narrative it had nothing to do with news or the truth brand\nThat let me ask you something now once your eyes are open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself but I've been experienced as myself and it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that once you see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women\nYou know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened but they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary\nThat it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world it ever seen so\nThey may I ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'll give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way\nBut you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is that they're a homo\nPhobic dino phobic Islamophobia that they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die and they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true\nThere's not one thing that is true about that look look at the state for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most ah these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that says oh these are just automatic vote well\nThat's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're\nSeeing so how many people have joined your movement\nSo the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand of president or something like ... yeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand\nIt to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this is for me like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf support and people are leaving walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around the block a time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary ... we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be you know I ran into what's that ... the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington\nBlumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show one night and I went you know and this was right in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings and he was being a lunatic and I ... I was polite ascent center and how are you\nWhat's going on man I'm I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that I mean I don't get this behavior I don't it's not effective I said if you like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people acting that way\nYeah well you know my story shocked I I I went up to the White House or as the air force\nLike wake you know light and get it off the adults it for two years after I lost that position you'd I Love the way off the deck and travel and that are worth they were after last night I also walked away so I mean I'm not quite the\nTransformation that Brandon is\nBut I I went in as a military officer proud to serve less\nResulted in election and ... and then planted and hook ... social media an album will be at age ... it'd be a great tabloid checking your thousands and thousands of people to be walking away I should get testimonials and I can't wait I mean it's going to be fun and it's also going to be asking him to send a signal to the rest of the country get\nCaught a party stands for nothing get substantial ... ... ... ...\nA ... day and talked about it in mainstream media specialized thank God for you shot and what you do um but it's time for people to wake up whether you know I'll tell\nYou one thing I don't like being lied about um you know twenty twenty ... I I don't I'm not a racist and I don't want to be called one I'm not a sexist or massage therapist\nOr a homophobic Xena photo Islamophobia I Want clean water not dirty water clean air not dirty air I Love all children they're all children of God\nAnd I I Believe that you know what we got to take care of the elderly whether they can afford it or not we're country rich enough to be able to do that\nThese lies that they tell really pissed me off because that is not any conservative Brandon that I Know but conservative policies especially when you compare them to ... eight years of failure of Obama we see a dramatic turn around\nWhere the forgotten men and women in this country in other words Sean Hannity Thirty years ago that's what I Want for the country\nI think that's what we all watch uh for the country\nI Am glad you guys are doing this event it's on the twenty seventh it's wearing a DC\nWashington DC right that we're having to walk away march on Washington it's on the national all\nThat's going to be John Marshall park starting at twelve o'clock Saturday and then we're ending up at freedom laws that for the main rally which will be around to thirty pm\nAll right and is there any website for people to sign up or they just show up\nWhat they should just show up but they could also go to walk away march dot com which is where they're gonna find tons of details and information about the day this Saturday walk march dot com\nAll right good luck to both of you and uh it's an interesting story a transformation a brand and then I I think that if it fits perfectly with Winston Churchill's observation that if you're twenty and not a liberal you don't have a heart and if you're forty and not a conservative you don't have a brain", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "24"}
