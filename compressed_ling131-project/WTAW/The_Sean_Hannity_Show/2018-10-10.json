Seventy miles an hour right now in Chesapeake Bay because there's this reaches the coast\nAnd those same professional effects I'm Talking about overland diminish the storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay ... there'll be a nor'easter from a DC to to Boston\nTell me because I really what ... what are the areas that that may have a tornado activity exactly so people can make preparations and be ready\nWell south in the south and east of a path let's say from Columbus, Georgia\nOr to Greenville Spartanburg I think ah to Raleigh Durham to the tide water of Virginia you live south of needs to that path and the further south east to go the more the more you have to watch out for that you're going to see tornado watches and warnings\nBe put into effect in those areas and ah over the next several hours I Believe they'll start putting that out\nOf putting that out in Europe they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into friday\nYeah All right now I Want to just go through this very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is that pounded hard\nThe the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast and as it moves north east it's going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through it on\nA hundred mile a hundred two hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty two hundred and\n... and then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the the north east coast or to the Carolinas I guess through the tip Columbia through uh the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City\nTwo AM in the morning on friday and then about a hundred miles east of Norfolk in the morning or seven AM eight AM and then on out to sea and a glancing blow a a you know ... like a nor'easter for three to six maybe eight hours or New Jersey on into south east New England out of this\nAnd this is the last this is the last one short so you don't have to worry\nI didn't know was the last one that fascinates me is that is the last one this isn't going to happen for the rest of the year\nWhile we knew back in September that we're going to have one come up out of the Caribbean because it's the overall patterns and I'll tell you what folks you ... ... and he says has two thousand and two all over again except literally\nLowly which was the big hurricane in the Gulf hit a little bit earlier and Louisiana and October but we had all the warm weather in September and October this is pointing the way believe it or not this is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big winter for much of the United states this year\nThere's certain types of patterns is set up so it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm that will then establish it we may see something that tries to develop but stay or most likely stay offshore before it's all said and done but impacts dorms on the United states this is the last one in my opinion\nJob or start a you're helping to save people's lives and uh you help every day you nailed this with the exact pinpoint perfection an accuracy\nWhich is so vital for ... people that make proper decisions about whether to stay or go\nOh thank you for being with us we really appreciate it will go back to you later Oh thank you for having me showing All right eight hundred nine pool when Sean if you want to be a part of the program there is a really disturbing piece on the law and crime website it's Dan Abrams website That's a sister website the media I ate\nAnd ate chronicled the FBI Director who's testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency now\nYou would think the answer is Oh absolutely not but that's not the answer his answer was not exactly\nReassuring now the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer\nThat question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump and during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible\nThat the president's conversations with international leaders remember\nWhen he was first in office they were leaking conversations with\nThe president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible that the president's conversations with international leaders are you know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to in this Saturday\nWell then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... the database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that most senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner of consistent with the law the constitution a that's a subject to extend some oversight I don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations\nAnd then Rand Paul as director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up by the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with\nSay a terrorist naming them and re decline to answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nOr that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director often said the answer is yes and as this time with ray was drawing to a close you spoke about the potential abuse within the Pfizer system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that is why we asked you to get a warrant\nThe information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no constitutional matter to that data\nAnd yet you're going to use it\nOn a domestic crime\nThat has been our complained for years and years and years and I got to admit after nine eleven I thought it was\nIt was in years and years and I got to admit after nine eleven I thought it was a great idea never having any any belief\nThat it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within\nThe intel community the FBI and the deal Jay that would literally be weaponized sing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people that I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate\nHim put together a flimsy dusty a with Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer warrant application but not one for the original application and three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information\nWas bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified it corroborated but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified my swearing you know we'll get into this\nYou know with chairman Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that this is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant\nThe bar is even higher when it comes to a buys a surveillance warrant and what has happened here is the single biggest abuse of power\nCorruption scandal ever now we've got three people on record saying that Rod Rosenstein well he has a plan hatched to surreptitiously record the president the hopes that they can invoke the

Trump is truly historic and all and it's not just the Supreme Court justice although obviously will thrilled\nThat we were able to finally a success and she even a victory last week but that doesn't that's just the beginning\nOf the fact is that the president and the Senate majority leader have worked together to move almost one out of every four federal judges towards a more constitutional more conservative more American\nInterpretation of the ... of of of the law\nAnd this is a remarkable achievement\nIf the Democrats would one of the ... complicated when you've you've got quite a certain

does that mean it means not a single\nColumn judge will move forward not a single Trump affordable for so control the Senate was absolutely vital\nIf in fact you want to continue to move towards a pro American constitutional conservatism which I think what I find the help when the election sixteen\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure\nI tell you who's not measured at this particular point uh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today\nJim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you're not and bring them in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenas that McCain memos the kitten was or what the New York times\nCited said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording to present the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have in the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that McCain memos and we've asked Mr burgers time\nTo come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen so that that you know Mr ... is leading that you played shot he talked about ... he he talked about facts and and the here and it is and how our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency\nShow what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you the committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house the majority leader of the house\nA Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA that we would subpoena ham and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could literally force him to come and testify under oath and answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan that you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and now James Baker\nAll saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states in the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm in that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running Justice Department should not be joking with support it's about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do that particularly at the time that this was happening remember on this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on may night the president fires give them call me on may seventeenth Rod Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\nAs one of the things you enjoy it happen in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was a menial leaks\nStrategy so that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we've got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only are they leaking been aired of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed\nTestimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media\nCould not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies the application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony it is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they failed to read them do we know they failed to read them or they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed that out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warns that that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated\nThey'd never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher ... deals\nYou know dot CA and as a result that was used as the bulk of information to attain the war ends and the problem is not\nYeah and as a result that was used as the bulk of informational pain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth than what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that ... at a steel ... said\nBelieve all the things that were given the British or but here's the other problem is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get\nPut in a a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick it truly is ticked me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appeared tomorrow\nUnder oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of both the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte indicated that he would do that\nSo now at the time obviously to get that done and that you're Mr Rosenstein it then there\nAre answered these important questions now\nThat we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may night may seventeenth of twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look\nWe've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take

because I'm I'm looking and seeing online and and various media sites social sites people are literally live streaming the hurricane and there's some of them are even on the beach for crying out loud meaning that they're ...\nThey're showing that probably live streaming away from the center because I don't think anybody is live streaming where this this thing's a bulldozer about twenty mile wide bulldozer wherever it's coming in directly it looks like Panama City was on the west side of the wall and you know I guess this port say\nPorch saint Joe it's gonna be you know I I fear for that area and there it\nIs called the perfectly said Panama City was ground zero it was and you also talked about the direction that the storm would hit you are right about that which as you predicted yesterday and and the day before and numbers in Sunday that the angle at which this storm was coming in and made it that much more devastating\nYeah again it's different from a different from Florence Florence did not come in at her peak this came in all guns blazing as far as intensity goes\nAnd it's one of these cases where everything came together but you could see it coming together even back on Saturday and Sunday ... as you do I do do you know a sudden that email out so he could play in the show and see what's going to go on this week I've got some good news for you we're not going to be

know why it's so important that we put you on and you have this incredible encyclopedic knowledge of every hurricane that's ever hit the United states for crying out loud but\nMore importantly with the knowledge that you have you can import that knowledge to our audience and you can save people's lives because you know think about you know the years before media we had meteorologist and the ability satellite imaging for example and the ability to actually track and follow these storms\nAnd all of a sudden people will wake up and they're in a category four or five hurricane than they had no idea where it came from um ...\nThirty eight hurricane you know you live that Long Island is legendary their those people had no idea what was coming in\nWay Joan I'm old but I'm not that old I

cetera but I'm the American people the most generous on earth and any help we can give you I Know that will be available as soon as this thing passes I pay attention\nThose that are in Augusta heading up to Columbia South Carolina because that's going to be in your area tomorrow with eighty to a hundred miles per hour winds that's pretty devastating uh All right let's get to our busy telephones here as we say Hi to reasons in Charleston South Carolina reads Hi how are you glad you called\nThank you sir thank you for taking my call I'll be brief out which is Conan I'm Wondering what the possibility of getting the president to\nEither director suggested deer jade we'd go after these false accusers whether it be the DNC Hillary Mrs Ford is not for a criminal part but for the civil part and the cost of the wild goose chase ... they were sent on\nAre trying to investigate these things from ties and and so on and so forth and then strengthen the laws against false accusations 'cause they ruin people's lives\nOh I you know I I never said this but you really think about it\nAll of that information was disseminated to the American people to lie to the American people to feed them propaganda misinformation so that they'd vote a certain way but more importantly then after the election that they lost in spite of all of these efforts all over the line that kind of always takes place\nWhen and that's what the Democratic party does every two and four years in spite of all that then they use this phony information\nAgain and again and again I\nA media league strategy feeding information from one source to multiple sources to seem like it's a real story when it was a concocted story\nOf a scam if you will and that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about well to some of the uh\nTo counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about\nWell the ... and the FBI now admitting that they had no evidence of Russia collusion at all that's why they disseminated the information that's why they leaked it to their friends in the media that we're willing\nYou know accomplices and all of this and then they talk about undoing a presidential election surreptitiously going out and recording the president unbeknownst to him so that they can then both the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policy is in place done and finished I mean that's what happened here\nYes sir and all these things are again being being paid for by the taxpayer and work basically taking it in the rear end every time they do this\nAll true there's and unfortunately\nYou know when I say this is the biggest abuse of power scandal corruption in American history I Am a thousand percent right and we still haven't gotten it right there is a reason Rod Rosenstein does not wanna testify\nHave the information recorded or do it under oath because he knows he's up to his eyeballs and every aspect of all those\nAnd yet he's the guy that has all the power I mean it's amazing isn't the literally the well the eye of the hurricane of you well All right ... thank you appreciate it I'm let us go to James in Cleveland James how are you glad you called\nI Am fantastic Sean thank you for asking 'em for small like to give my thoughts and prayers and everybody on the coast going

a a number of Trump or back in two thousand six Jean\nAnd I'm completely changed my whole point of view on that\nI didn't think he was electable and I didn't think was conservative back then and I was wrong in fact I lost a hundred dollar bet with a fellow employees from mine over it paid him up the next day pretty much since day one I've been defending his actions are the president's done a fantastic job here to help my family\nAnd myself so much I Do remember three things in my entire life\nThat I've noticed that the federal government actually do for me\nFirst was the Bush tax cuts and now this fabulous cut from the European Trump this time around as her so much money in my pocket you know the other thing that affected me\nWas when my Cadillac plan was cancelled because of the sea and Obama Karen's costs me nine thousand dollars out of pocket since my company dumped are Cadillac plan well thank you no grounds for that and things you Republicans were giving me more money in my pocket\nYou know I'm Glad you you said all of that because there are a lot of people out there that are still the never Trump or land\nAnd they won't recognize it look I can understand that they don't like the president's style um it's maybe ... ... it's at odds with how they would manage things but you cannot argue\nThat he's governing as a strong conservative that gets results and I'll take results over rhetoric any day\nAnd ah I Wish some of the other people that were in your camp would would be as electrically honest\nOr as you are and I applaud you for doing so ah and I'm Glad you're doing well I'm Glad your family's doing well hey you all know I'm a big big fan of liberty save long before they were an advertiser on this program I did my own research it is the best built safe on
