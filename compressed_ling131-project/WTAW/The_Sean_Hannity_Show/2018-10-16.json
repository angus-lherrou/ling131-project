since Trump's been elected record low unemployment for for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans vets\nWomen in the workplace youth unemployment\nThat I mentioned in any of that because the media is not mentioning it they just want to hate Trump every day that I mentioned that\nOh the marketwatch printed today that the number of job openings in the U.S rose\nTo a record seven point one for a million in August reflecting strong growth in the economy and the best labor market in decades\nThat'd be CBS is marketwatch not Hannity's marketwatch job openings topping seven million for

your politics are keep your hands to yourself that's my advice\nSo now here is an interesting Washington Post ABC News poll Republicans now a head and the key battleground house districts now this is the most important part of the poll if you look at it they quote ABC News is recline took a look at the current\nGeneric ballot polling which favors the Democrats put you know it it always favors the Democrats although we have other polls that have shown that that that gap has narrowed\nSignificantly what he's pointing out is the core concerns now with three weeks to go three weeks from tonight you're going to get the results is that Democrats worry a whole lot that mid term enthusiasm is gonna wind up wasted in places they don't need it in other words but they're really finding is somebody translate that\nOh they have the generic ballot wrapped up in New York Chicago\nNew Jersey Trenton you know San Francisco everywhere in between they have a wrapped up in Los Angeles probably but not in red state America\nAnd what this analysis shows is inside the districts that will result in the the balance of power in the house of representatives put it another way that will decide if Nancy Pelosi once again gets the gamble and become speaker\nIt is a dead heat\nForty six forty seven Democrats versus Republicans very similar dynamic driven by democratic strength and cities their weaknesses in rural areas that is driving house and Senate forecast in opposite directions in other words the Senate is looking\nGood\nMarsha Blackburn after the tape my project that she's doing

race at this point\nSame thing with ... you know Heidi Heitkamp was the only way these Democrats can win as to why do you not talk about what they really want to do\nNew York times is now concerned that Democrats could be in for disappointment on November sick a column their headline what could ruin a big blue wave two prominent New York Times columnist sum up the problem with these words quote Donald Trump seems to have a faded Hispanics voter\nRath what ... what does that mean anyway you mean the fact that we have the lowest level of unemployment for Hispanic Americans and African Americans and women in the workforce look I I get to some people don't like Donald Trump style but you can't argue with\nThe results and you can't argue with the fact that he made promises and he's kept the\nKind of refreshing\nAnyway goes on to point out Hispanic voters despite all of Trump's border cruelty he's well he's always talked about some people to commit crimes and I've been down to the border more than anybody at the New York times\nAnd I've seen it myself maybe they should go to the drug warehouses and should ride horse back all terrain vehicles and helicopters boats like I

I mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as a more of a friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah and ... plain how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style or Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I have done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork the headaches a half of the middle man [laughter] so that now medicines are pity pill now you can call ... ... email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cellphone\nRight so this is now they implement how many places did you get this finally\nUp and running around the country ... I don't think you're explaining detail enough here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits offices it's free tale of medicine so you can call ... ... email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasounds heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesome medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nThat it's working everyone you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nUh the horrible correct I mean we want to go down there to try to take us down the path of socialized total government controlled healthcare you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decisions based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to helped hurt it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans walked or health care chosen by you know Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians and the health care with it but the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nWhere did not leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about redistribution of wealth and\nYou know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America at the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven\nPercent so what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan\nWhen they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket and also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\n... this is a one size fits all model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to ensure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring\nThe ... of always try to ensure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand hardcore thighs I'd a blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality and and lower their price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance\nWe need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this upfront pricing lower cost no government mentally aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care of local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors\nAnd one thing that's clear as the calorie is not coming from Washington to say now if we wait for the pollution from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our ...\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's\nIt is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number ... grows the

I Would pick a fairly smart guy right and and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that with this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly went back to parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back\nAnd oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the story at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the poor people that Julie sweating except we're at those parties one's dead uh to wouldn't returned our calls in one didn't know who truly sweating it was so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story but also the hunting on it but in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process in the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe ... over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nAnd he goes against the grain and thank you for a great job thanks so much quick break right back your calls on the other side of big candidates and I tell you about that and the minute including pastor Brunson is going to speak out his first cable interview tonight at nine what it was like in prison in Turkey and much more [noise]\nThen all you're gonna see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump pay and investigations and possible impeachment that's the agenda\nThat's it there's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... you know there's a lot at stake\n[noise] the Democrats rely on people of low information they rely on propaganda and putting things out there and can be used in people that's the way it is\nA let me tell you what it is they they got one play book they're the party of smear slander mismanagement racist sexist massage in is seeing a phobic homophobic Islamophobia dirty air water kill children skill grandma it's the same playbook\nIt's never changed on Thirty years in radio it's never gonna change when they did get power\nFor eight years with Obama you saw what they did with it it didn't improve the lives of anybody\nIt left many Americans behind the worst the economy in modern times was Brock Obama's so\nYou know I it's amazing that they don't want to talk about well the tax cuts I'm working now they want the crumbs back and do well healthcare never worked out for anybody but they want to keep it they haven't made it ... it but are there focuses the hate Trump investigating Trump nonstop\n[noise] All right um but I look on the other side I'll be blunt\nYou know if three weeks from tomorrow it come on the air and say well you know we're going to be stuck with Nancy Pelosi you didn't get out you didn't vote you know what we'll survive it will fight we're not going to stop\nBut it would be so much better and so much easier for all of us and especially the forgotten men and women they just get no foothold now in terms of jobs and opportunities for themselves and their families\nYou know now that it's going to be you know a battle every day non-stop accusations non stop fighting\nWe've had that for two years since Trump for president that supposedly coming to an end but we'll just pick up and we'll fight back that's what we do you don't give up you know given you just stay on it\nYou know you have to win these political battles matter you'd get the government ultimately you deserve America deserves better than what the Democratic Party is offering but that's going to be up to you\nMy vote here in New York was meaningless in this whole case it's not going to help I Can't help you in this election\nUm except tell you the truth I'm telling you the truth and I'm saying all of these races are infinitely winnable right now\nThere's ... there's been a change Democrats have overreached they've they miscalculated and the American people are good fair minded people they're figuring this out pretty quick they watch the judge Kavanaugh\nThey see these mobs they hear these you know these incitement this these marching orders if you will by radicals that are Congress men and women and senators\nAll right let's get to Don and Detroit's way John James is like the greatest candidate he doesn't he's doing better in the polls he's down in single digits I Wish the people of Michigan gets the outright those guys he'd be\nHe's that's a long shot for us but while he'd be amazing\nIt is a long shot for us Sean thanks for taking my call that I probably have its own campaign and let\nThem take your enthusiasm away this man deserves a\nVote no no not at all where we're going to the is this will be one of my first campaign rallies for Senate or for a Senate I'm ... I'm going to have kid rock there is going to have 'em Donald Trump junior and Kimberly guilt foil there tomorrow night\nIs that gonna meet tomorrow night where I live\nOn the Michigan from six tonight I I don't remember exactly the venue but people can look it up at John Jay ... Senate dot com\nLet me tell you something this man is beyond impressive he has all these leaders\nIn the army at the same at the same time it's him but he provided air cover for me I was a flight medic provided a lot of air cover for me when I was there is an awesome awesome awesome man yeah\nWell I you know I look at his background and his experience and he just you know some people just have it whatever it is they have it they own it and um I I just think he's a natural leader and I hope the people ... pay attention to\nSort of live sir Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan a couple of weeks ago came out and they they dangled is cared front of us and they've done it every year every two years they think it was carried out in front of us called\n... border security in the bill funding the entire wall\nRight only if they went in two thousand Eighteen we had a fight where we were bloodied whenever we attended a Trump rally we were bloodied up and the reason Donald Trump was elected one of the big reasons was because he was going to build the wall\nThe reason he won the election was because he said he was going to build the wall the reason we maintain a majority in Congress\nFor the past eight years and especially in two thousand sixteen was because the Republicans were finally going to fund the wall and when Kevin McCarthy came out who I have a lot of respect for came out a couple\nOf weeks ago in ... in front of the voters faces I was screaming at my TV saying you've had the opportunity to present Donald Trump with no less than three spending bills and neither of those bills get\nIt had any appropriations for border wall why why you had the majority in Congress for eight years he won an election not to I was sixteen for building a border wall they they act like they're losers they don't know how to they don't know how to act like\nThey do but he's been more critical than me I mean I I Know I have a news the adjectives spineless\nGutless needing a back a bone\n... look at this point it's too important we've actually gotten a real lot done the president what he's done in terms of ISIS degrading and and feeding them at a level nobody anticipated\nNorth Korea everybody thought we were headed for real tragedy there and you know which sole thirty million people their lives at risk no more rockets being fired over Japan were not dropping pallets of cash cargo planes of cash in on the currency to Iranian mullahs\nAre as we see what's happening on the economic front for point two percent GDP wave\nAs we see what's happened on the economic front for point two percent GDP\nWe we watched that economy go from losing jobs to creating four million plus jobs at this time eight million fewer Americans in poverty and on food stamps\nI'm we see the pipelines are being built an war is opened up um we've spent three billion three and a half billion on the new law we need the full funding you're right the twenty five million a but we're making progress to originalist on the Supreme Court great judges on the lower courts\nAnd I I just see in America that's transforming before our eyes based on every measure consumer confidence everything in between uh yeah I Wish they would have worked faster they would have kept their promises better there's still a lot of work to do but the alternative is nonexistent\nThere is no alternative if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi in the house vote for a Democrat but the Senate you're voting for Chuck Schumer\nAnd that's it if you you know you save the house and Senate we can get a lot done we get these additional seats in Indiana North Dakota Montana if we you know hold in Nevada\nAnd we pick up with Martha mix Sally in Arizona I mean and we Claire McCaskill gets sent packing and Rick Scott wins in Florida it would be amazing holding the house is key\nIf it even if you don't particularly love you Republican congressmen it's not going to be an impeachment investigation vote that the Democrat is offering you\nSo for that reason alone I mean it's important to me will survive but I'm not saying we wouldn't not going to come on here the day after election day whining complain I'm going to just dig my hills in and do what I always do after elections and let's fight for what I Believe it\nBut it will be so much easier if we just did it on election day\nAnyway I appreciate your call I'm Dana is in Oklahoma Dana Hi how are you\nSaying well Shawn thank you so much for taking my call and how you doing\nI'm good what's going on with you um I just listen to all the time and I think she's a picture I listen to the\nGimmick crack and it's just such a petty and they are just about ... um power hungry and he can if they don't want a traitor and I'm like honesty\nThey don't want one nation under God which is a certain I'm not God and I'm just thinking and that's just all I had and just wish everyone was required to listen to the rich\nRequired required Hannity four hours a day and actually it might be used as a punishment for some and you know in jail or what but Hannity on a loop [laughter] [noise] so anyway I think it everything you're doing\nI appreciate listen I don't have the microphone but for you Dana and people around the country I don't have a TV camera in front of me every night but for you I'm just telling everybody we can win I Am saying it is with in its uh with in the realm of\nPossibilities that we could win and shocked the world again but it's going to take every effort of every single person hearing my voice now and then some and that means you getting others engaged to vote and explaining what the consequences are All right so you\nKnow I Am a big fan of liberty safe there the number one save manufacturer in
