we're already they get it by scholars on by the\n... not by the FBI should we should the FBI now investigate them if there's just a new standard Jonathan\nNo because that's our authority that those are local crimes that happened and I'm a case where we need it Robert do however um he that would have been a state matter because that the time a Bill Clinton was the attorney general\nYou know and so but here's the thing that you keep saying in danger or have you been here for you keep missing and so many people that are emotionally involved with this if you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate but if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are none\nAnd there's not going to be any because it doesn't matter\nWho you question the very people that are the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't know anything\nAnd so if you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or hurt here say it becomes here say you know that from being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence the case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I totally agree with Jonathan totally and the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is the\nThat's the thing that totalitarian I'm a governments do\nLook look I agree I think one thing that's important got back to this is what is the standard here this is not\nA criminal investigation out they said an investigation and to conduct that may or may not had beer in a way that somebody get a lifetime appointment um and I understand and I agree that this is the kind of extreme like political and extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\n... question do you have any corroborating witness\nOr any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat have been on the question that as an unseen\nReally I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... ... I I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is it's going to make question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there is no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel passionate about something if somebody says\nWhat other information do you have that much intimate question because there is not in the FBI who was decreed it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have an ... it would be them\nRight and on the side there is no corroborate evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was there and I think I think people are emotional for for ...\nAnybody actually has a copy of is summer calendar that year but we don't have an exact day anyway so right right and you know what you're saying is that you know he has to prove his innocence or is the innocent before proven to be ... haven't been proven guilty what what do you believe in\nIs innocent until proven guilty again this\nIs great so he hasn't been proven guilty and you know has he he has not been proven guilty and it's gone on a long time\nNot to a legal standard that would be required or ...
