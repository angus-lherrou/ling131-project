thought they were going to win because they have the media in their pocket and still do then they said you know why\nWe got to abandon um the free market place we have to now going assassinate people and this is very similar what happened in Germany and bringing it back to the\nAnd find a way of saying that you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that\nThey that that people today are like not the killing people what you're saying is that there are similar lying propaganda Mitt observation demonization very different from saying that they're a death camps\nYeah I mean there's just look that can't happen in America thank God because our structure is still in place to prevent anything like that happening\nBut I'll tell you what antifa no different than the essay George Soros

we're living in a dangerous time\nWhich let me in terms of sue this you're I'm agreeing with you that that what really got exposed to me that scares me a lot and there's two things one is we ever do

is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh abandon all principle constitutional law and the\nAnd and literally core values that have served do so well which are

Beaumont, Texas\nBut you have all of this outside Texas money being poured into ...\nOne of the most fascinating things you know we have four million viewers last night with\nRush Limbaugh and they'll pay you do the hero of the radical left in this country all the once they even impeach the president needed to represent Texas values but he's got Seventy million dollars from outside the state pouring into his coppers\nJust a smear and slander cruise which makes it very difficult because some people begin to get influenced by these negative ads and bathe or rock wouldn't get a million viewers on CNN last night they gave them all our\nThat is just pathetic the hero the Democrats that they're rising star couldn't get a million viewers are on CNN last night they knew that\nIt it is amazing to me and it's it's happening here to show on the um the my porch raised raised two point six million dollars just last quarter alone in Ninety percent of it almost Ninety percent of his car from out of state\nOr they are particularly upset with Michigan because the last ... last time around\nSo they want it back so they're going to do everything they can to steal the cheer and up by whatever they can and they're they're investing heavily in our state I'm Nancy Pelosi alone is just throwing three million dollars at my race to try to take me out and it just keeps on going it uh it it does now coming from every direction\nOr the little scary what are the poll numbers no showing in Michigan the district\nWhere we were still up a bit uncomfortably close and that's what we don't like your career where courage people could get out and we just got to your base I devote ... your your team and your audience can I can help we're at a lick my Fisher ...\nAnd your audience can I can help we're at garlic my bishop dot com and and that we'd love to have their support\nAnd your your opponent is a woman named Alyssa a slot can correct correct yes and then while the urge her supporters to boycott local businesses that have signs that support you\nAnd she just moved into town uh she never lived here before she never improperly year before she never pay taxes you'll be for\nFirst time she voted was last time on this last primary for herself and you're right she came to town for the first time met with a bunch of my uh my neighbors and told them that if if businesses don't come Rochester and my little hometown\nI had had signs up for me that they should work out and uh and not give them business and and these businesses have been hit by phone calls and threats and and and intimidation for weeks now just because they\nHave ... really angers me let me tell you how I Am where I live\nI Know everybody that runs a business there's a deli in my town I go to my local deli and there's a meat market in my town I go to my local meat guy there's a local grocery store I go to the local grocery store I go to the local pharmacy or I go to the local gas stations whenever I can\nI I I Want and by the way I don't ask if you're a Republican or Democrat\nI I I Want to keep you know ... these businesses serve their community by being there and that's why I Try to I Try to do I go to my local restaurants when I can you know I've I've really go to three places so it's not like\nI go to that because it's just ridiculous if you've been through what I've been through it restaurants where you know you just can't believe the crap that goes on if you're in public in the public eye but well anybody that's going to say and everybody in the eighth district of Michigan\nIf you're having Democrats saying don't support local business if they don't vote for me that is exactly like Hillary saying we can't be civil ... the exact what's the difference\nThere certainly there's no difference and most of these people are supporting me not necessarily because of my politics but because they know me my entire life we went to school together\nI frequent their places of business from this person has come from out of town doesn't know and but then for me that's that's just a an attack on my community and it's a it's a statement as to what what she thinks about all of us and\nUh and she's ... pay taxes in our local community it's unbelievable\nNo she's not here for that she's here to take power and that's all she wants\nLet me tell everybody ... if you cannot hold a business owner hostage to vote either my way or I'm not going to patronize replace now\nIf somebody has a radical view very extreme that might be a circumstance where you just say I'm just not that those values are so\nAntithetical to my own personal values I'm not I'm not going to\nReward this with my my my dollars but most business owners like man that they're fighting to stay alive every day and it's just it's expensive to rent the expense of the employees are expensive then you've got to pay for benefit plans all sorts of stuff\nIs wasted a lock 'em and I just want to tell the people it's Rochester area correct\nRochester ... Livingston County ... County Michigan\nAlright listen we really wish you the best Mike bishop I'm Sorry you obviously have a big bull's eye target on you I'm", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "19"}
