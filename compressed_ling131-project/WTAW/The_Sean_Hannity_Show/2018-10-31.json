really desperation I'm I'm I Can't wait to see what the what you might say tomorrow the president's right on everything I just happened to both the wrong way every single time but the last two years\nA we have some new polls out of Florida finding the Senate and governor's races they are statistically tied\nA Florida as the one state I'm worried about in terms of both the Senate and I don't understand this obsession with Gillum or the way he stuck taxpayers\nApparently with travel causes of fundraising about who's getting a lot of money from oh we oh that's right we have breaking news on Gillum than I Do we owe undercover tape\nAnd then lying about their ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections sport layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nYeah a lot of ... listen lying is just a part of it the playbook that the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse\nIn a look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting that took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and what does the media but out they're blaming Donald Trump for it and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his\nStrong support for Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem wearable along so well it's interesting I was so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one from my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so\nIt's message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the and the west coast a message over money and results right results look what we have done with this economy\nOn the national international stages well ah with the president when it comes to sitting down with North Korea heading for denuclearization ah we would help\nOr making sure that yeah we did move that embassy from Tel Aviv Israel prompts was kept and being a shining light on the hill or were there was a lot of darkness for a long time still is but the shining brighter we lead in the world others will follow a more prosperity and peace um\nYou'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nI think it's a lot of things I did I vote him\nLook I took a vote for any Democrat and any district Ball Four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs his vote for polo seat because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi and vote with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings a look at\nThe the agenda Democrats is it's it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes\nThe tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back they want to eliminate eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just the definition of just or dash city\nConsidering they look how many there are counties I read in Iowa that have seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors and plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that's\nIt yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high they can't even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right\nMy opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp for hopefully not Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes open borders doubling down on government run health care\nAnd of course what they've tried to keep under the rug shot and you know this and our listeners now this impeachment\n... know that an endless investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file\nA Justice Department an intelligence people but they do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon\nWell listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy races if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now\nAnd one week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a ball the best you and six days ah it's tough out there\nNobody can predict what certainty but I Will tell you they don't I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me and I never you never really have\nA feel for how the house is going to go twenty hen might be an exception where I mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming\nSame thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans had been out of power from forty years that Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house and also if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against that forty five retirement and\nA headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats\nIn the first midterm but then like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving of Clinton because things got better\nBecause Newt Gingrich force Clinton into what led to balance budgets and and serious reforms in Washington\nAnd I think the same thing you know you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty ten am specially after Obamacare and ... and you know the fact that Democrats are that that's their main talking point now I'm this is really fascinating to me there's a brass means the poll out today I had to go back and double check it\nShowing that African American support for the president is now hit an all time high of forty percent I mean that's a five hundred percent improvement\nIf you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey\nTrump's approval rating stay is at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range\nAnd I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not before and and all the media likes to go after asked me to say I don't know why he's a great guy and smart poster but\nYou know they say oh he's a right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that rats museum was the most accurate Poland twenty sixteen so if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact on the midterm elections but\nAgain it's all up to now the interesting developments as a relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico\nAnd uh now you have and I look there's always the most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey hope an opportunity and the American dream and when you live in poverty\nAnd countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do\nAnd freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally\nOnly asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders and I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that care of and want a better life and that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen\nThe president's been very clear\nI'm left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some\nProbably a tiny tiny percentage declare point two percent\nOr you know less or summer quarter reporting that she identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away\nUm but actually the Mexican ambassador the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border we're asking the people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of\nThousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there and he's not going to let the men nor can he\nGoes there will be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty or nation built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws\nAnd we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border official telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan a that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer told the examiner\nFamilies and unaccompanied children make up about twenty percent twenty to thirty percent of the caravan Roy of ... is the deputy chief patrol agent for the border patrol San Diego sector arrested that a single adult males he goes on to say\nUh Mexico now is shut down a lot of their public transportation so the people in the caravan went up to walk with you know literally weeks away\nOr solutions and sports business exchange ...

great how are you guys doing we're no reading well greetings from Colorado I'm Sean hey Mr Speaker I actually wanted to take a minute and talk to other parents and grandparents out there of millennials\nAnd young generation X voters we as parents and grandparents cannot be complacent if these are adult children or grandchildren are not showing any interest in voting\nUm we need to do all we can do to educate them on the importance and the seriousness of this election and all that is at stake and Sean I've been using your talking points to convince my adult children that every single vote is important and what's at risk if they don't vote\nAnd here in our house we turn to boats into three to five and then possibly even more because our kids took the message to their friends their college classmates and some of them ended up voting as well so\nA couple of weeks ago I spent three hours on the road driving and mail in ballots semi adult child has a student at University of Colorado just to make sure that that one single vote is cast and counted so hey everybody do whatever it takes to get their vote in um offered to drive them\nTo vote in person and pay for their overpay for FedEx to mail that athletes here a mail in ballot to be two in to make sure that it gets counted and trust me the future of them will take us\nWell thanks for the call this is bigger richer\nEvery oh every parent who's that Syrians are\nLeaving June to children them and making sure who can understand the issues are going to be voting on I think that's a that's a great state

you\nHey I Am a grandmother and I'm you know this caravan coming over what bothers me is they just let people go in and they never make their\nTheir court date and my grandson was sent home because his inoculation a record were not brought up today did they just like these people in without any inoculations I mean why didn't the CDC or somebody getting upset about this\nWell listen I I I Want to be very clear 'cause I think a lot of people of um I I think that's almost been used as like a scare tactic of people\nLet me tell you what I think Mr Speaker see if you agree with us you know I think the Ninety nine percent of people that were in that caravan they see America as the land of milk and honey and opportunity which we kind of take for granted sometimes as Americans\nAnd I'm sure that Ninety nine point eight percent of them are probably good people just want a better life um we can't vouch for any of those people in terms of other enemies of America that are mixed themselves into that group\nThe idea that we're going to have five seven fourteen thousand whatever the numbers are different estimates room everybody just get to our border in charge across\nA there is no respect for American law our constitution our sovereignty\nOr we don't know we need to be able to vet people I Believe in a border wall with the door because uh we just want to make sure the people that come to this country can sustain themselves and secondly I Want to make sure that they're not enemies of this country and we can that but that's all it's for the safety and security of everyone that is a citizen here\nYou know I think that's basically right and I think part of what people you know the ... the\nDegree this short period of American immigration which really made a ... huge Jordan or a country that we are now he's began um windows on welfare state to people who came to America came to America expecting to work and they came to America you teach Thirteen to learn English\nAnd uh I
