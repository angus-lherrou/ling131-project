the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment anyway it turns out\nThat not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this is this supposed chronicle by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page that's Peters drugs boy friend\nThey went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend\nAlright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker they told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said now we've got three witnesses that say that\nRod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was conveying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts the hurricane force along the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves up it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind\nPower with this hurricane is Panama City\nAt the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm and you folks over there you ... you got you got remembered the way the northeast or the fight of Florida shape even though to the east Appalachia cola\nOr the wind won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge in there because all that water that's to the east of the storm is piling up\nAnd heading in there and do that by to Florida I think Tallahassee probably going to get wind gusts eighty Ninety miles an hour and they're not the power out in Tallahassee during hurricane Kate which went very\nClose to Ninety percent of the power was knocked out in Tallahassee and I think you're going to see Ninety a hundred percent power outage or with this there I'm I'm just saying the when should be higher in Tallahassee at least the gusts with this\nAnd we'll have severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon tomorrow night possibilities tornadoes are from Florida and then prove southern Georgia coastal South Carolina North Carolina or during the day Thursday as this moves up rapidly northeast\nIt's a scary All right so what do we get landfall and uh what would you recommend that people I Know a lot of people live on the coast I've been there a number of times it's actually it's so beautiful um and it's but there are a lot of homes right on the water so\nOut between three and nine PM tomorrow thinks one we're going to have landfall\nAnd I think things are really going to deteriorate very very rapidly um it appears tomorrow morning midday and afternoon and there you just got to get out I mean you know again what for its you know we had a hundred hundred and ten mile an hour winds there was a bad storm it was spread out\nThis is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing where it's a it's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour winds and a lot of folks you can see what's going on with this you saw with Florence Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the CLA photographed the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter\nAnd that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nIs look there's nothing magical about it and I we wrote I wrote on this weekend I I Know that sounds pompous but you got people saying we've never seen anything like this it's already started with the climate ambulance chaser\nThis has been telegraph so far in advance and even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem coming up into the Gulf of Mexico and if it was going to be what we call rapid\nRapid development feedback we see that happen every now and then and we are fortunate with uh Florence said it was you know if it was off its peak this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do when given the ideal situation and that's what this is\nSo it really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at my own but your website actually so you have it hitting land it's really going to start getting we're up about noon tomorrow with little before\nRight and that and then the the landfall I think sometime between three and nine PM it Panama City will get that down in ...
