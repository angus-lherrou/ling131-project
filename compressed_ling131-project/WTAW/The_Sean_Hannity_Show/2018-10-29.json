Saturday Saturdays anti Semitic master gr to Trump\nIs too big facts getting in the way while the Republican Party rejects anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders I never get in a rural what Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about as anti Semitism\nAnd his racism the shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently a you know as Ron ... rightfully said oh this weekend on Fox News that you know these burial an anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that has taken place and this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've read it we've studied it they've gone through it all and we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary all these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is\nIranian mullahs chanting death to Israel or president said we will seek their destruction which is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism\nSarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump\nBut there's the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel we haven't had a president in modern history\nThat has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel and the middle east ever and what an act of courage was apparently but there's other presidents have promised that never did it\nAnd making Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel [noise]\nAnyway we're going to get to all of that the Fox news similarly under attack I've got all the latest numbers on the election um I'm also going to tell you it\nRight now I Would say the Republicans in eight days my prediction is today I'll give you one every day there's any updates they pick up seats in the Senate but I think we're down in the house by Bible explain why\nBy threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo\nThat story came out this week yet he's been threatened there was a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn and you had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half a dozen angry liberal protestors they had to be\nAnd a half a dozen angry liberal protestors they had to be removed you think of the language or we can't be civil with Republicans and kick them and all the other comments that have been made and then the other silence when it happens to a conservative\nReally shouldn't be something that's political and calling somebody fake news I mean it is so disgusting overt CNN\nSomebody sent me a transcript I guess was on news busters of hump the dumped the oh I understand that CNN doesn't like fake news and they don't like being called fake news but they are fake news and other news organization anymore they have gone full time destroyed Trump every second of every minute pretty much of every day\nThat's what they do so they have this panel I guess if they put together and they're talking about what happened\nIn the synagogue shooting and we have to look closely at the poison being spread sometimes on television sometimes out of the mouths of political leaders\nAnd often times on ugly dark corners of social media yeah it can be pretty ugly and it goes on the first panelist as Bill Kristol or never Trump her he attacks Fox News\nI'm like hello\nWhat we can't have conservatives in my I support mainstream conservatives a bill I don't know what happened to you I support original is on the Supreme Court I support lower taxes less government burdensome regulation I support energy independence\nI support legal immigration I support border security I support peace through strength and the tough national security posture with a strong military to defend the\nValues that we all believe it and I support you know a free press even to be wrong even criticize the media for being role\nAt a Washington Post columnist comes out some woman I've never heard of Margaret Sullivan\nYou know her praising or analysis and the Democratic threats et cetera et cetera reads like a list of Sean Hannity is free broad ... broadcast crib notes and that is asked point blank if she blame people on the right like candidates for the violence\nAs a martyr about this this week uh with regards to the bomb attacks or the suspicious packages you said you know look at all and target city this reads like a list of Sean Hannity's pre broadcast crib notes that was the way you put it in your Washington Post column again are blaming the hands of the world\nI think they have a share of I'm sort of this you know revving up of hatred um without regard for a wedding effects my feet and without much regard for the truth I mean the way things are being patch on Fox and and\nA pro Trump right wing media is dangerous and destructive so I think we need to call it what it is\nNow ... Lewis was on from the Daily Beast of all players and he actually was the only one that made even a little sense he said the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be Hannity's targeted\n... perverse incentives to gin up their base for elections I think a cable news has incentives to a jet up anger and anxiety and passion for ratings same thing with websites with clicks and tweets\nAh I agree with everything that we've said so far today the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be\nSean Hannity who was targeted for a Republican congressman who was targeted and while I agree with the condemnation of what Fox has done in terms of gender up this anger over the caravan I think that this is a much more widespread problem\nWell it is more widespread and I have had far more instances and I'm willing to talk about a real credible threats towards me and my family including the one that I did share last week\nWith white powder purported to be anthrax sent to a my office\nAnd one of my employees having to spend an entire day in isolation scared out of her mind and it's been worse but obviously these people are not listening to what I'm saying\nBecause I have been saying we've got to know what what do I advocate I'm like okay I Want I Want these principles stood up for\nI fight for the American\nForgotten men and women I fight for lower taxes less pure bureaucratic regulation energy independence\nSupreme Court nominees that believe in the constitution I Believe we should secure our borders legal immigration is things I've I believed in my entire life and career a strong military security for the American people a strong stand against evil in our time\nNot that complicated\nI Know what the democratic agenda is if they win it's gonna be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they stated they want their crumbs back we know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the elimination of ice and they think Obamacare works and it\nDoesn't you know you had an MSNBC\nYou know literally pressing the Israeli ambassador termer the blame Trump for the synagogue attack that's how sick it's gotten you know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political ... he's not\nBut I guess it's an easy blame game so now we've taken the predictable every two four years Republicans are racist and sexist a massage therapist and Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic and they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff\nAnd now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true and it's not any conservative I Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shut up the synagogue it was a very ill an anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump but that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing\nThat narrative\nKnow this is you know watch watching the Washington Post alone is unbelievable Fox does or their headlines Fox News and the rest of the right wing media can escape responsibility\nOh I've been the biggest supporter of Israel that I Know in the mainstream media have been my entire career friends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades than there during the war and been there at other times reporting\nShowing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show them friends who they who Brock formally Shimon Peres\nLet's name names according to the Washington Post\nTrump's hate analyze our inciting extremist all those extremists in the synagogue hated Trump those are the Washington Post headlines that you got\nTrump to GOP defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people on CNN fake news that couldn't identify 'em up for who they are these phony hypocrites Trump blames it and you know something when the media lies twenty four seven and they get called up that's too bad\nAnd you know something when the media lives twenty four seven and they get called out that's too\nBad that is not a call for violence unbelievable the times that we're living in now here is um where we are the Senate is interesting\n'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch called and I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll\nAnd Menendez just barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard but possible\nPeople in New Jersey clearly fed up with and then does\nThen I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why Floridians are flirting with Gil almost got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott ... pastor job as governor and\nIt'd be a perfect complement but the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada\nI don't know why Christ in similar cinema well we've got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nI don't see how somebody who supported Americans joining the Taliban could win and Arizona and calling her own state crazy and the meth lab of democracy and inviting radical lawyers for the blind shake I don't know how she survives\nHeidi Heitkamp I don't think she's going to win and North Dakota that'll be a pickup\nAs long as the people of Indiana don't vote for the libertarian and split the ticket the Republican their Braun should be able to win that race and that would be a pick up or Republicans\nI think Montana's a little bit and play but I'd say favoring pastor at this moment protest or can be beaten there and I think the biggest thing is I'm looking at real clear politics and\nWe think it's cool this is exciting tore WG a W College Station Bryan\n\nJobs they hate me some ... those words\nFrom a rabbi moments ago at a

going to deal with that all the other issues of the day threats against Republicans that the media just outright ignores\nAnd the mob mentality continues will have full chronicling of all of this as we continue eight days till election day the best election coverage available on your radio dial\nEverybody but me you know I make a living for people not ignoring mine and I think it's not what\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in a midterm election showed him trailing by Thirteen he won by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election worked turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nI talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to his view is twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelicals are pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got emails on about half of them uh we\nWe have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us more tax and more door not where\nDo you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and Minnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power\nBut then I say that and then I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them could tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide it um and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right now we really see the house is on the bubble we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now a hundred seats in play\nAnd probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remembered the special election in Georgia sex when they had all of a you know two three four five and he lost by four\nIt's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers in the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking in election night to the\nTo the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shocked the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally when I read the exit polls the five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and at that moment reading the exit polls trumpet lost Florida\nHe'd lost North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania He lost Ohio he lost Michigan he lost Wisconsin He lost it all\nKnew he barely won the state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls at five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the boat out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI I have to be honest with you Sean I got to give credit where the creditors do first of all\nA to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited\nAnd secondly to the Democrats for during the cabinet nominations trying to air and destroy a good man and his family\nAnd we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen and we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country there overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood\nWe had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted\nA guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenity at her or she sent me an email later and said not only am I not to hurt that I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's that kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country\nYou know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of decency and character still alive in this country the answer is a ... yeah it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is to use the social media I don't think anybody has a more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nThink that's right I think ah you know a rock Obama was the first social media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president in the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer\nI assure you Trump has mastered it or not only in his use of social me\nI in air I assure you Trump has mastered it or not only and his use of social media platform but also the thing is that his campaign in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms Seventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact her on Twitter or Facebook\nOr another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get dropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing their social media count then begin to go elsewhere\nSo I agree look anything's possible I ... I don't take things for granted\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening because I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic\n'em and you can see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate and they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's the split a situation\nWhere Republicans get seats in the Senate but below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half a vote for ... if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for ...\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that\nWants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know you see different polls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president we have a very strong organization out there\nWe have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and this one gentleman

their foreign or thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for below sea they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show or in the district\nTwo points back where the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're in we're gaining momentum uh we've we've debated several times I made and every debate she will not agree to any additional debates are we caught her actually listen as we caught her in the debates talking about\nSupporting open borders then she correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border twice she said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was ... running on a ballot\nEyes open borders but now as we get in the general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're gonna exposure for what she really is\nWell this is a really important race a now Mardi knows Dina's running for the seventh district of Pennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district\nLehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania a it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spent as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but\nI Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing it talking to our election boards you know this many presidential election is what they've told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned it so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any orders feedback as though you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in I have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and it'd be alive and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise]\nYou know we're in the middle of the great American comeback last two years have given a lot of people hope in this country\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they want opposite went freedom they want liberty they went opportunity that's what we want as what we have and we must continue it\nWhich is the best Marty all the best thing I Know you'll bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of\nPennsylvania and Lehigh County or will be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out Yes sir\nThank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you've got to understand this is now how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nIt's one point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience that have everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're going to vote\nAnd you're not going to stay home and you got to put any effort and you're not going to give a half of ... to ... vote to Schumer it could be you know shock the world again kind tonight is happy you stay home than it's you know maybe we split but the baby in the sense that you know it's\nOkay we said we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any one of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our busy telephones ah let's say Hi to Katherine\nIs in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you enough how much my husband and I just absolutely I think you are the greatest not because of just what you inform us because of your courage and the wind farm hearts and prayers\nGo out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that said our hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage\nAnd by the way you are right up there with President Trump and his entire family and those that stand by and\nI Want the conservatives in this country to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way like maintain your credibility by being civil\nAnd stand up to all these bullies and oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing and the lie they're telling about our gear presidents\nI'm comparing him to Hitler and style and which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to but the problem is we've got a\nLot of a lot of very frightened people I think President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation\nBecause he's he's taken the curtain back and all the corruption in Washington and then something\nI'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner of laughter caught a surge in five years ago and still fighting today that's that's fine but I just want to say if if the conservatives hearts and shed risk and then to gather and consolidated\nGot it and let me tell you why are we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they'd been so wrong Ben Sasse was one of the bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them\nYou know the if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because\nYou know that if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh it was Donald Trump that did it you know it doesn't matter that he's transformed the economy all things that they said that they is conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation\nA energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify\nSecuring America's borders all of the things that doesn't they hated all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way\nThat that that set everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old establishment way of doing things get nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington and he exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know ... they're the type of Republicans the basically want to just sit in power in the corner and\nAnd act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil that are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs at you so I you know it's it is what it is I the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that has benefited our population and then I Want security\nIn a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nI Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest bad US military and then we can handle any threat to the world throws at us and we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil when evil\nYou know raises its ugly head but there's it's happened before and it's going to happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically\nYou know temper tantrum politics\nOf never Trump or is there there's still mad they got it wrong you know we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts\nWe wouldn't have the regulations to roll back we wouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence we wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have\nThat's why in eight days when people go out and vote this all matters a major question people have to ask is are you're better off than you were two years ago in terms of the economy peace and prosperity\nDr elections and if you want\nThis prosperity this growth to continue if you want America to remain the leader on the world stage if you're not afraid\nTo have a president that is willing to be a tough\nNegotiator on your behalf\nBeing trained or NATO or Kim Jong un we didn't give anything to Kim Jong un nothing and look at what we've gotten back a shot at peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula you know if you want a president that says he's going to respect our constitution the rule of law are our laws on\nBorders and security and respect our sovereignty first and demand that people respect our sovereignty first then you know where to vote this year right so in the midst of all this chaos and whining and election season\nUm you know what we have so many differences Kavanaugh caravan
