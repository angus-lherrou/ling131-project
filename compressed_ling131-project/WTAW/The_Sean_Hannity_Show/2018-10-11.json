went undercover and where do you hear what is said\nAnd by the way this is one of what's going to be a series of tapes that will expose all of these red state Democrats they say one thing when they're running for office what they have very different plans after and later and we're going to get to all of that\nUh let's say out of ... just in Ohio Toledo what's going on regions how are you\nI'm John how are you I'm good what's happening\nAt Jim Jordan and Dave Brat on there and you've had a a a Trey Gowdy I think previously over the past time\nBut the thing that irritates me about when you talk to these guys and this Rod Rosenstein a fiasco that's going on [noise]\nYou'd never ask them why don't they just somebody stand up and make this guy up here and how does he keep his job when he won't come and you know go before Congress like he's being instructed to\nWell I mean that's a great that's a great point because you and I wouldn't be able to duck a subpoena you know we you and I wouldn't be able to if they subpoenaed are documents good luck to us\nIt was like in the case of Hillary Clinton do they have yours subpoenaed you know your emails and your delete thirty three thousand of 'em and then you bleach ... your hard drive and have someone must stop your devices and take out some cards just what's going to happen to re just take a guess\nYeah yeah I Know you're going to jail in

we've been able to peel the onion to the point where we've exposed to all of this happened they there's been every document we have got news because we had to pull teeth to get everything I mean we we are getting their hope you see that\nYou're giving it to him on a platter but they won't act on it for\nWell it's not Jordan and it's not brat and it's not meadows but it is some of the leadership and the Republican Party that are weak and timid and learn nothing of the success of Donald Trump that I can that I can agree with you on\nGashed babies and this is what I mean evil exist says you just said in the introduction to this chat evil exists and we in America have to face it\nAnd we can't turn away from it any more if we see something wrong\nAnd I really thought the the attack on cabin on his family was so desperately wrong um\nWe had it was hard out a you broadcast forty three years you know every two and four years if you're conservative or Republican you're a racist or sexist you want to kill children you weren't granted to but to go with the clip they'll have a whole Ryan look alike doing it\nThat that is a smear but you know when I think a real evil I think of nine eleven or radical Islamic terrorism there is a political component you know why would America ever drop off a hundred and fifty billion dollars in cargo planes in cash and other currencies\nOn the tarmac of radical mothers that chant death to Israel death to America that to me is modern day appeasement\nWell you have a you have a world that sharply divided in what is considered good and evil um and and killing the says really brings it home you're either going to be a person who fights against evil or not\nBecause some of the people who help these ss people get away after the war we're talking the red cross we're talking elements of the Catholic Church we're talking elements of the CIA helped\nHelped Eichmann ... warm in and Barbie get away and and and you have to be able to distinguish in your own life everybody listening to us right now what is really evil let me give you a real small thing you might have talked about it it was a writer there is a writer for cold there\nWho put out a tweet that said yeah even though Kavanaugh is confirmed at least we destroyed his life you saw that right\nI did talk a lot about it was horrible we don't care what the man's life\nThat is an evil statement yup now that statement could not happen from Sean Hannity's crew or bill O'Reilly's crew it couldn't happen because if anybody did that working for us they wouldn't be working for us much smarter would that\nNo not at all did anything happen to the writer for cold there nothing okay\nSo now you're starting to crystallize there are Americans apparently like Steven cold there who don't really care if they're members of their crew are trying to destroy other human beings doesn't really bother them very much\nBill well here's what scares me about the process we live through every two and four years\nAnd I say this is somebody that really the my heart of hearts you know I'm a blue collar guy like you from Long Island and I just want the the good blessings in my life I Want an opportunity for every man woman and child and you're the only way you going to do that is that get government out of the way and let people do it they were born to do\nAnd I I look around me and I'm I'm listening every two and four years and then judge cabin on Robert Bork and and I'm thinking this this is we've got to be better than rushing to judgment they did it with Duke lacrosse they rush to judgment of burgers and they did it in in Baltimore they did in Cambridge\nWe've got to be better than just the band inning core constitutional fundamental issues like due process and presumption of innocence\nThere's more to it though the new element in this that you and I didn't have to deal with in the first Twenty years we were both on Fox News channel\nIs that the press the media which has always been left has now\nAllied itself with the heart progressive left there in it together that's new and then you add in the millions of dollars going into groups like move on media matters color of change you know the groups\nMillions of dollars are flowing into those groups and their own only mandate is to destroy people with whom they disagree\nThis cabin or thing was not accidental and it wasn't caused by one woman stepping fourth\nThis was an organized thing\nThat if they couldn't get him before the confirmation on merit they're going to destroy him personally\nIt was organized you would have seen it and I have seen it\nWe've seen boycott sprouting up we've seen demonstrations spontaneous we've seen a woman in an elevator with the CNN camera brow beat Senator Flake who is that woman she's working for a saw organization making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nDid anybody report that so there is that he will step up this is a step up and the Americans are largely it get rid of what's happening\nWell let me ask you this we've got an election and twenty six days what does the impact of all this going to be\nI don't know it depends on the awareness of people but if you look back into Nineteen thirty to Nineteen thirty six this is very similar to what happened in Germany\nKorea did people in Germany good Germans looked away they did not confront the evil that was coming at them and I'm put forth you in America we are\nEvil that was coming at them and I put for you in America we have a lot of evil coming at us right now and I don't know how many

asking young people are going to vote and are going to say there's they know because they're not really ended if you have been in the middle is while I've got to be with law enforcement you were integrated into all this politics\nHave you yourself ever seen ... uh the Democratic party ever leave any sense of normalcy of what this country is all about I mean I remember when Reagan was in office the Democratic\nWay only thing I Would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialize medicine didn't work out\nThe Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick Morris and others\nTo move to more to the center right and we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton signed it and it worked but it was more at a political necessity than any any principles that that he held deeply liberalism\nIs a failed law the ideology that never works it deems grade on paper free health care free they care free free free you know ...\nWe got this guy running out Doug avenue some in

he's not getting in trouble\nThat's true but if they're going to do that if they're going to stop ... I'm not saying throw away all the video games all your phone in the river ever do any that's all I'm saying is that when you're raising your kids or even by yourself\nYou have to remember that certain things can't be done online you still have to learn that eye contact sports these kids that go on job interviews still have to be able to get their hobby that's a personal relationships and excel if you're an adult and you're sitting with that phone next\nTo your bed at night you wake up for ...\nKeeps you up in the middle of the night and that blue light and then they didn't find the ... bridge asleep that's\nA problem I heard from so many people that said that it was interfering with their lives\nWell you'll be ... out of me I listen I did enjoy having Twitter fights with people a lot\nAnd I will go much it ... it was well probably a little too much I mean I was I mean there would be announced meant a game on Hannity is at it with you know Alec Baldwin or ... Jimmy Kimmel whoever I happen to be fighting of the time\nAnd I realized it became another job but more importantly hey Lynda what happened with our Twitter account was compromise what was once compromise and I just finally said this is ridiculous and I I just took it off my phone I don't I I window does the tweeting and somebody at Fox does the tweeting\nI just you know I said please sweet those so pleased with that I don't have to do\nBut there's also a component here too because we also talking politics\nAbout instant gratification I'm like ... gratification society people don't get processed anything anymore nobody desk and I think if you look at dating in relation to anyone who has teenager should be terrified because these you know these apps and kids are in social media what kids are doing all\nThese sites it's all very overwhelming and you\nCan't test to temper that relationships are requiring that all the\nValues that we value I must be talking about conservative values all on now for that is that's great but a lot of that going by the wayside with the with the ... so that you can't play video games and you can't have fun and I watch a a bitch watch something on like but you also have to remember to have these conversations with your kids to have conversations with yourself you felt the\nSocial media behavior Congress and some pop stars it's\nNot it's not it has gotten ... no doubt I mean like a certain amount of fighting I'm not going to sit here and why I kinda like\nAnd it's entertaining to watch people bubble in ... when you take a shot as these old leaders in uh Hollywood or left wing or but anyway the book is great do not disturb how it goes to my cell phone to take back my life should have diabetes ...\nAnd of course you seal off and on the Fox news channel now that she has been rescued from the view and\nWe we appreciate you being back with us and it's good to hear your voice thanks for being here\nThank you so much on greatly appreciate it\nI Want to go back to what happened earlier today at the White House when Jim Brown and Kanye West met with the president it was an unbelievable exchange I Want to play a little extended version of it here and then we'll try to get some calls it was sort of this\nYou know people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats\nI have a a I have conversations that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it is it to a limit to amount of jobs are so the the father's lose their jobs and they say we'll give you more money for having more kids\nIn your home and then we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and\nThe prisoner re just shot out now you have shot Iraq where people called ... which is actually our murder rate is going down by twenty percent every year I just talked to the superintendent met with Microsoft Access Ron\nWalters a right hand man so uh I think it's the Waverly that helps you see this game called life\nYou know they try to scare me to not ready to have my own friends but his hat it gives me it gives me the power in a way\nYou know my dad and my mom separated so I didn't have a lot of mental energy in my home and also uh I'm married to a family that I'm\nNot a lot of mail energy going on in a beautiful though but there are times where you know something about [noise]\nYou know I Love Hillary I Love everyone right but the campaign on with her just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy that could play catch with his son it was something about when I put his hat off and made me feel like Superman\nYou made a Superman that was that's my favorite superhero and you made a Superman case for me also as a guy that looks up to you looks up to wrap around looked up to American\nIndustry guys nonpolitical no bullshit [noise]\nAnd just go there and get it done right now you gave me the heart to go to a fetus because at the heat is when I went in and two thousand Fifteen were fourteen billion dollar company losing two billion dollars a year now we have a thirty eight billion dollar market cat it's called the ... effect and I went to cast\nFor we had a meeting of Chicago and I said you have to bring\nManufacturing on short instead even shore into the poor sad about the borders the core of you to Chicago is the core of middle America we have to make America strong\nI mean the the the thing made me a billionaire and I could have lost two hundred million dollars walking away from that deal but even with that I knew it was more important for me to take the chance and walking away from that deal than I have\nNo fathers in Chicago with no home and when we do have personal reformation for no cause it's oh it's humbling patient not\nRehabilitation 'cause they didn't have the ability and the first place we never had anyone that taught us we didn't teach us is that we had no one has taught us right so I'm a it's more important than any specific deal any anything that we bring jobs into America\nOf the movie that I Love the liberals tried to do [noise] love to try to control\nOh I Love the liberal tried to do [noise] love to try to control a black person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud emotional people do and I said I'm like try to like someone as liberal they'll say oh what is right that you think of race and don't get\nAn invisible while\nI was like to know what you would like to President Trump to do for us to talk about and\nThen the thing that uh that the head of the police and um my ... when the left side of the so hard about what we feel that stop and frisk a does not help the relationship in the city and every one that knew I was coming here to ask\nStop and frisk that that that's a the number one thing that we're having this conversation about uh another thing is open it up\nIndustries and we've got to get some tax\nBreaks to because we know we're making um we got to speed factory in Atlanta but she was a cost us three hundred dollars to his confidence to too much to make things so we need some prototypes here so we can get people back working\nSo China can't just beat us and Vietnam can't we just got Levi the greatest genes company in the world making their jeans and a and Vietnam so we're going to need to get a few breaks to be able to have some places in my hometown of Chicago and a two point seven million ... million surrounding suburbs where we can create some factories\nI think it would be cool for them to be ... factories 'cause he's a master of industries a builder and I think it'd be cool to have easy id Asian\nCenter which should be a mix of education that\nEmpowers blink gives the modernization like sometimes people say this yeah they do this you have is eating\nYou know he's gone as far as\nAs I say I think if we can you know I mean he's gone as far as\nWe get more curriculum like basketball while you're doing\nYou you you learn about using while you meditate in the morning we have to say the mental health and our programs\nBack into the uh back to the city so those are ... and also very Hoover\nIs an example of a man that was turning his life around as soon as he tried to turn his life around they hit him with six life sentences believe he's where you say don't tear down the statues\nLarry Hoover is a living statue he's a beacon for us that need to see his family that needs to go out and represent when you have a leader on every single block they didn't own a block and that's something I learned from Jim route from America can we need to put curriculum\nFor people who really came from the streets now people who are just\nTrying to set us up to go into work system were written a system that apply to what people are really going through which Jim Brown is created\nWhen I'm On my arm sit on the debate about the second amendment going on while\nI'm In the legal or illegal guns and the problem not not not legal ... we have the right to bear arms\nI mean let me tell you what what the most interesting thing that I think people there is an opportunity now\nBut conservatives just looking at the job numbers as one one indicator record low when unemployment fourteen states record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace and youth unemployment\nNow it's always been that it's the left liberal so they have a monopoly a compassion", "show_name": "The
