Nashville, Tennessee Rick welcome to Monday talk\nAll right thank you so much Bob uh I've come to your program fairly recently kind of late in life uh if you will and I'm enjoying the program and I am a subscriber now to the newsletter\nBut my challenge as I got about two hundred and fifty thousand in the balanced index fun at vanguard which I'm learning now you don't recommend because of the\nUm the the the bonds and narrative already a longer duration\nI'm and I'm moving towards trying to be in portfolio three I've got some funds now in the in the bonds that you're recommending there but I'm Wondering should I stop putting my money and the balanced index fund and open up the\nA total stock market with it being as high as it is and then if if I Do should I just move everything from that balanced index\nTo the total stock market I'm kind of\nA little bit of a quandary 'cause most of your callers seem to be a long time listeners and I'm really not\nWell I think the first question to ask is what kind of an asset allocation are you comfortable with in terms of the percentage of money that you have in the stock market and the percentage of money you have an income securities what percentages are you comfortable with\nWell um I think I'll be I Am comfortable with the fifty fifty and I'm really trying to work a torch that fact I think I probably have\nA because I put some cash that I acquired recently in the money market account for the prime money market account I I really have an asset allocation\nThat is really about sixty percent bonds or other and only about\nThirty five percent inequities\nWhat I Would do a and you have the investment letter so it's easy for you to do is I Would look at page eight at the balanced portfolio model three\nWhich basically is if you look at the percentage column that's a fifty fifty balanced portfolio based on the percentage allegations and that would be my top recommendation\nFor how to be invested at this point\nBetween the stock market and the fixed income and when you when you look at the fixed on income you're going to notice we have a very short average duration and in fact the average duration in our income portfolio on page seven is less than one year\nAnd it's very similar for the fixed income portion of models rate so that would be the approach that I Would take and the reason would be as you said\nI really am not a band right now having the longer the rations and I think if you look at the performance of the longer the ration bond funds they really have been dragged\nUh they've really been a had a drag on those on their performance and that drag has been what's happened to interest rates I mean after all it was only two years ago\nThat the ten year treasury was one and three ... percent\nJust two years ago in the summer of sixteen the ten year treasury ... one in three eight percent now shielding two and seven eight percent so it has more than doubled and you\nOver the last two years and I think that has really been a drag on funds that have had longer bonds into portfolio and let me say welcome to money talk always great to hear from Nashville, Tennessee\nOr toll free line one eight

retired too as\nWell in let's start out by saying I Am way more comfortable way more comfortable at that point of\nHaving a a balanced portfolio which would start out basically with a fifty fifty allocation so you're allocation would be different than the allocation I Would choose in that situation\nEven though I'm at Seventy Seventy eight thirty to meet you ...\nYou're you're you said you were Seventy percent equities I think is that right\nNo no no no I'm I'm Seventy percent neutral Mosul mutual funds\nOkay well are are you are you talking about mutual funds of stocks\nNo snow so nuclear ... whatever the case may be which\nPart of that that would be that would be stocks or what percentage of your portfolio is in the stock market or stock market mutual funds\nAre about forty five percent\nOkay so you're pretty close to fifty fifty right now\nYes sir I okay\nYeah I don't have a problem with are investing in exchange traded funds as an alternate the mutual funds I see this sometimes our listeners will say you know I'd rather have an exchange traded mutual fund than an overload pond\nAnd of course there no load anyway but they're they're they're trading during the day so they're seeing traded funds they trade like stocks I don't have any problem for those who want to use an alternate for ... let me give you a um specific example of what I'm telling you about\nSometimes we'll talk to a money to a caller and we'll save\nThe total stock market index right and then they'll say well why I'd rather invested in exchange traded funds and then will say well we'll go with Victor tango India right the TI that's an exchange traded mutual fund\nFor the total stock market index\nAnd so that's fine I don't have a problem with that if a if a personal preference is to invest in Victor tango India the TI exchange traded shares instead of a till the stock market index so I don't have any problem at all\nSo I'm comfortable perfectly comfortable with using a\n... an alternate exchange traded mutual fund for a specific no fun to keep in mind not all ... funds have an older than that exchange traded mutual fund but it certainly there's an example in that case the total stock market and the case so yes the five hundred or a good example is um\nIs SBY the SBY shooters despise years again in exchange for a mutual fund which invests in the as the five hundred index in that case just like the no funds that invest in ESP five and actually generally get very very low expense ratio is if you're dealing with the right firms in these areas\nMore grudges or on

I gather commercial property and it's fractional share ... do you know what I'm Talking about\nWell I understand certainly what a real estate investment trust is yes\nAnd it's not bad at Delaware

give us a call back and we'll see if we can take a look at it at that point when we have a clarity on exactly\nEr which instrument you're referring to Margaret thank you for checking in from the mile I said hey how about those Rockies or those Rockies on fire or what\nIt's good to see always like to see that\nBut she had to win on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago Joanne welcome to Monday tall\nThank you um I have a question I'm about I'm already retired I'm six two I'm I'm Single I'm I have I guess my home\nAnd so I have three hundred thousand dollars that I'm not sure what to do with\nUm I met in your mouth portfolio three\nI'm safe heard you talk about you know not putting everything is a lump sum right now our dollar cost averaging we asked I never really quite sure how much\nMoney and market or where the markets at which actually determines weakness I Know it changes but I'm not sure how\nSoon as I must take a look let's take a look at whether that's even appropriate in your situation uh okay you have do you have an investment portfolio right now\nI Do and let me tell you after listening to your show for years I should be doing a lot better but I wasn't always doing what you said to jail\nSo I Am for my friend said listen carefully and do as you say so um I Do I mean you have idle portfolios three right now and I have um\n[noise] well I buy a home in Florida out of that so now I have two hundred and twenty seven thousand at that and then I had that three hundred thousand in my bank from the sale of my home All right we're buying\nBank from last out of my home\nAll right we're going to get by in ... where did you buy in Florida I ... just south of Clearwater\nOh yeah I've been a you know um what do you plan to do down there in Florida moved there\nWell I Am planning on moving essence they sell the house but it does seem like people over there where I live in a place they use it as a layover style at for their vacation so I'm going to Europe and I'll come back when the hurricane season so far\nYeah not a bad idea there at all [laughter] especially especially on the Gulf Coast in that area so you think you'll do you think you'll live there fulltime\nI think I well I'm I'll be back in Chicago because I Love it here and summer's are beautiful here yes so um yeah I'll be back and\nForth I'm not quite there I'm retired so I figure I could do whatever I Want but yes I Do plan on for many purposes right now the letter there\nYeah well you sold your ... your sold your home so you would have to make some other living arrangement to come back to Chicago after the your house settles right\nYes right now my brother and sister in law scene can light it to happen here so I think also like an ... when I come back or um and that's what I might do in your common\nNow do you have any debt any a debt outstanding\nI Know that good for you good for you\nSo you have to ... your two hundred twenty seven thousand right now invested in model portfolio three which is we've described this a balanced portfolio you have two hundred twenty seven thousand there and you have this three hundred thousand that you've just taken it as a result of the civil the property\nCorrect\nNow do you have any sort of a a contingency or emergency fund set up for yourself the case you have an unexpected expenses have you done anything in that regard\n[noise] I used to but I use some of that money plus money um and that I had in the stock market to buy my heart so advanced right now yeah I probably have a you know like do I have probably about a factor in my three um\nI'd probably about eight twenty thousand dollars\nOkay so that might be enough for emergency fund for you are okay I Would just say I would just say that in looking at that three hundred if you want to you could take a portion of that and add that to your contingency reserve funds so that you always have the peace of mind knowing\nThat if the known expected the expense or arises you had that money sitting there and I would use something like uh the um\n[noise] my favorite place right now for short term money is the vanguard prime money market and the ... let me tell you the reason I like the the injured prime money market uh first of all shielding over two percent which is a very generous shielded today's uh today's world for a for short term money\nAnd um and the second thing is is liquid\nWhich means that you ask them for a checkbook you get a check book on the account and you can write checks two hundred and fifty dollars or more you can even pay bills\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars or more but more importantly you have a check writing ability\nA two hundred fifty dollars or more in all cases you check writing ability and that's a great way to have a money market account with liquidity with check writing so that's my favorite way to invest short term money and if you're in making less than that right now wherever you're keeping the money I certainly would give that some consideration for a great\nChance they tell you one other thing I forgot to mention really important sure and another one of your favorite topics I Do happen to be a product of a Illinois teacher Pakistan fracking mentioned that's not based on\nNow what what kind of a pension is that what kind of a pension does that produce\nThat produces Seventy thousand a year okay so that's certainly by the time that gets me is like forty thousand a month right now\nYeah so you put a lot of years in for that I'm sure\nI did\nOkay so I'm All right so we have that and that's very important and what that might do it that provides you more income than you need a that might mean that you don't have to do a full four percent withdraw you might do a lesser amount in withdrawal\nWhich helps the overall integrity in longevity of your portfolio ... for example even or even reducing the amount from four percent to three percent\nA celebration

for joining us\nWell we have the new numbers now when the federal government a budget deficit widened further in the month of July the federal government\nPosted a budget deficit of Seventy six billion nine hundred million\nAnd a that was even higher than the projection of the congressional budget office so the fiscal year to date gap now is six hundred eighty four billion\nWe still have August and September to add to that and for the first ten months with the fiscal year\nThe federal deficit is up twenty point eight percent on a year over year basis\nAnd I'm the office of management and budget is now projecting\nA budget deficit for the fiscal year ending September of eight hundred\nForty nine billion dollars yes this is during an economic recovery the yes this is what is normally called good times for the economy this will be the largest fiscal year deficit since two thousand twelve\nAnd if you take a look at the last twelve months the last twelve months deficit of seven hundred eighty four billion is three point nine percent of gross domestic product and we've talked for many many years about stuff is\nThe product and we've talked for many many years about deficits and sustainability of deficits and the generally agreed upon number in the economic community is three percent\nThat it's okay to finance a deficit up to three percent of gross domestic product we are higher than that we are right now at three point nine and rising by the way that's the biggest number since two thousand Thirteen\nOver the past twelve months federal spending has risen four percent\nWhile income has risen four tenths of one percent federal income revenue whatever you want to call it so we are now outspending the increase in revenue by a multiple of ten\nIncrease in

international fund that that is dealing in local currencies\nAnd now the opposite is true the dollar has been rebounding and it has the opposite effect on international funds and the dollar fluctuates it goes up it goes down it goes sideways\nFrom the standpoint of international investing the currency factor is most positive when the dollar is weak\nUm it is kind of neutral when the dollar is flat

a\nMarried it has doubled ... so\nWhat what is the rate on your mortgage\nIt's four to eight and the call that you had earlier I got my will target\nThat maybe that's not a bad idea anymore because you know because we wouldn't be getting that you know we wouldn't be getting that additional or the you know a\nBenefit to the money um is is that somewhere to put some\nMoney as a way to kind of balance in like you said it's guaranteed that no risk is that something to look at\nPens on the right doesn't it yeah\nAnd his ... his his rate was four point six by witches or in today's world is a fairly elevated interest rate a but a year at Ford an eighth a but you're right it is a guaranteed rich free return when you're ... more than ... percent loan\nOr if you don't have tax deductible the because of the changes in the tax code\nThen the only other thing you have going for you was inflation now would be fair for you to say well\nThe loan as cost me in the last year the lowest cost me for it and they bought you're paying back dollars that have been affected by inflation two point nine it would be right for you to it would therefore be fair for you to say that the real cost the money\nFor you over the last year's been won only two so in other words inflation is got ran in ... inflation is your friend\nIn terms of just discounting the real cost\nGot it so that God has attracted by\nWell are you are paying back uh depreciated dollars by definition as a result of inflation and a well let me give me an example if inflation was was born in ... that would be free money\nRight\nThat would be free money right\nBecause the money you're paying back to the lender will not by what had bought a year ago that's the reason\nI got it very good okay you recreate it repeated a\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that's why the rate on the mortgage\nIs so important when you're making a determination whether you want to repay a mortgage take out a mortgage or do anything with a mortgage the rate that you're paying on their money is a key element the tucked ability is certainly a factor inflation certainly a factor Don's\nOn the line in Illinois done it's your turn\nYou off ... when I call imam portfolio three in the non taxable accounts\nI Am the joint tax will count my wife uh I'm In for the total stock market and the prime money market what'd you add the ear to bond funds to the\nFixed position\nFor model three\n... from model three right and in the uh ... account\nYou don't have the ability to uh put your fixed income investments in attacks revolution ...\nAh no longer I'm a I have no ah earned income\nYou have any tax privileged accounts that you're currently managing\nTo get my wife and my own\nAnd they're and they're all they're essentially and portfolio three\nYeah I Do like the idea of putting a fixed income funds in tech frivolous accounts because you don't have to pay current tax on the interest\nWell but they this is this the ... just as the joint chap stick out see I'm I'm retired and the only good investments I can make are taking pension buddy and putting it into the tax bill account\nBecause when you're a ... million or ... what's your marginal tax break a Fifteen Percent or twenty five percent excuse me or does that include Illinois\n[noise] uh yes it does a but I'm the pension as a teacher's pension so I don't pay on the pension\nIllinois I I think I think I think I Would be willing to go ahead with that\nA ... to a a bond funds from part for the three\nAnd put it and we have we have three bond fund\nRight but I'm I'm I'm already in the primary market with yeah\nI I Would be OK using at the twenty five percent bracket rate uh I Would\nBe OK using a yes because um you're still keeping most of that money\nI see a and if the if the river lowered it even better\nThe tax rate to zero zero would be good\nTo me that [laughter] because I'm looking into effective tax rate and it's you know not paying twenty five percent\nNo I'm not looking at the effective tax rate I'm looking at the marginal\nMart Marjah was twenty five percent\nYeah 'cause that's what you're going to pay on any additional income or that you make that's why marginal mattered a that's why marginal matters for this decision effective\nReally doesn't matter for this decision it's all about marginal its ally of the ... and it's all about the next dollar you make what will you pay on the next dollar you make but yes I Am comfortable with it ah and um you know I think twenty five percent I Would go ahead

would make sense given the fact that if you combine real GDP Growth with inflation right now you could justify a four point eight percent ten year there's certainly a four percent plus ten year at least right\nAnd the way we get that\nIs by adding together the growth rate in real GDP the and we don't just take one month or one quarter we take annual rates if we take the last twelve months through June these are numbers we have in hand right now\nThe last twelve months through June real gross domestic product role is to point eight percent\nSo we have that number and we also have inflation over the last year and for this purpose we would use the personal consumption expenditures core index which is one point nine and so if we add together\nThe ah one point nine of the two point eight we get four point seven and that would be a normalize ten year rate and a little ... that we have to seven days so were\nConsiderably below four and a fraction foreign any fraction were still considerably below a two and seven eight so if rates do rise that would be a normalization and that would make economic sense\nBut what a phrase just don't go up much or don't go up at all from this level\nWhat happens then when the federal funds rate and the Ninety One day tea bill rape continue to rise due to said policy but you could run the risk down the road not right now but you could run the risk down the road\nWhere the yield curve would invert we're short rates would exceed longer rates\nWell if that were to happen that would be one of the preconditions\nAnd it would be unimportant reconditioned that we would then have in place for a recession outlook\nSomething to keep in mind if we don't see an increase in the longer term rates and if the short term rates keep rising due to fed policy we run the risk\nOf an inversion\nAnd that's where the catch twenty two analogy comes into play on the one hand it would make common sense economically speaking for the ten year rate to move higher\nBut on the other hand if it doesn't move higher and the short term rates keeps going up that's where you get into\nThe catch twenty two inversion interesting thought will certainly going to be fascinating to watch or as we say we shall no this in the fullness of time\nLet's get Richard on the line in Lincoln, Nebraska Richard welcome\nHi, Bob [noise] um [noise] my daughter when she was to inherited\nA I don't know fifty or sixty thousand I put it all in a a fan guard [noise]\nHasn't paid five hundred index and she's Eighteen now and as you know that's done very well [noise]\nUm [noise] my question is I'm thinking about putting it all in the ah vanguard total stock market and I just kinda spread her risk out and [noise] terrible tell her to leave it alone and she should be doing All right [noise] um [noise]\nAs time goes by what ... what do you what's your thought of that should I a dollar cost averaging or can I just [noise] throw it in their [noise]\nWell what what was the would there be tax consequences on this\n[noise] um I don't think so 'cause [noise] and they had you know I'm just taking it out of ah [noise]\nTaking it out of the five hundred and putting in a total stock markets and action that's inherited money so I don't I don't think so but I guess I don't know that for sure\nIs it personal money is it her personal money isn't as as as some type of a special account what's the deal\nIt's her personal money\nThat sounds like a taxable event to me\nWell that's I'm Glad I called you then um\nYeah I Would suspect uh what what do you think is the average cost on the money that she has their\nUm the S. and P. as a twenty eight fifty what would your guess be would be the average us and the cost of that money\nI I don't understand the question\nHow many years how many years if you invested in the sixteen him and did it all go in at the beginning yep\nAll right so sixteen or is two thousand two right so the costs on this thing could be eight or nine hundred versus the twenty eight that you might have a triple on your hands as this thing triple\nYeah yeah that's a taxable gain\nOkay [laughter] well I'm Glad I called you that I I think I'll just leave it in there and\nThe money that came in and dividends enough money that came in and this and the dividends every year that was taxable every year you know that right\nThe capital appreciation on the shares that you were originally purchase that have looks like they've tripled in value basically right that is that is a long term capital gain and that is a potentially a taxable event depending on uh her bracket so what'd you need to do\nIs you need to talk to a tax preparation expert an enrolled agent a CPA someone with with tax a moderate\nThat can answer that question for you because it will also depend on her level of income and any tax bracket that she might be in and it will also apply to the state of Nebraska\nRight good that she might be in and it will also apply to the state of Nebraska Richard if she's in Nebraska so you have some questions to ask but I'm Glad you called\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that is or contact number one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one\nClear is on the line in Delaware clear it's your turn welcome\nHi can you hear me okay first of all\nYeah you sound great clear thank you\nGreat I have a question um I Am a stay at home mom I Am done and I I had been out of work I raised my children since two thousand and one that oh it's my husband's income\nHas the opportunity now to switch over to all well\nGet a chore off for a one\nOn fifty eight I don't know if it makes sense\nFor seven years ... I'm Sorry to seven or eight years strap a you know we if we did it that we live in\nThe lower income that were attacked one now we put ten percent of whites that we would lose that however we get a tax free in the end\nAnd I don't know what's the matter to me now\nBut what is your current tax break that record the benefits you when you put it in the pre tax contributions what is your ... and you have to include Delaware in there what's your current marginal rate\nYou know I I don't know what with the way the at the lower maybe Fifteen thousand because we don't wait\nWhat we do and it's one bringing our income down probably around ... out and bought it out in the children's adoption and the the Internet adoption and they think they can stand around it but I think it slow\nSo you're you're thinking that the money that you're the pre tax money that you're contributing is really not give you much of a benefit at all\nI guess it does because if not let's say that\nYou know we're being taxed one eighty thousand income\nInstead of maybe a\nI don't know let's say we put away Fifteen thousand a year I don't know maybe that's what I look when you put it that way maybe we are getting that much but then if it out of it\nWell it would be interesting to see the numbers and you want to throw Delaware in there too because you have a state income tax indoors will um I Know these things 'cause I was born and raised in Philadelphia not far from where you are\nSo I Would say that um you want to check out the numbers and see how they work but I Would say this with with reference to any additional money you're you're putting in the\n... you want to see whether you're getting a benefit from the additional money you put in\nAnd I was really talking more about the additional money that you referred to the to put it in because if you're not getting much of a benefit rejects then why not use a Roth run\nWell true and I were off we can never be the one I think it's seven yeah well I guess seven years\nI don't know how much it's going to build up but if we don't end up meeting that I guess you know actually grow more than\nLet's say eight years when he retired we don't have to watch that uh we don't have to deal with drawl I mean can you know we could grow another Thirty years", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "07"}
