West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today or I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with them when they count so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nAnd I'm not ... well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his boat health care being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state\nSean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and mansion said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think that West Virginians didn't like that\nThey also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs Joe mansion how to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters\nManchin says no and even on Kavanaugh\nWhere people say oh we ended up voting for capping off the reality is he waited he actually left the Senate a voting chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then ... step out because he knew if he didn't do that he was politically death\nIs so so ah you know I kind of used a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you can vote for the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people in West Virginia and wish I would say on important issues like tax cuts regulation\nEnergy those are three main fundamental issues that that affect an impact the economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places and struggled with a ... opioid issues and we'd have a with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joe Manchin first vote will be for Chuck Schumer and Chuck Schumer is made no bones about the fact that he's going to head out\nThe obstruction resistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're powering these liberals the folks that really created all the rock destroying the Kavanaugh hearings then you're part of the problem so that's why people were so focused on\nJoe mansions first vote because the you know he's not going to be with West Virginia and he's going to be part of a team\nThat's tearing down the president West Virginians don't want that and that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia stick\nTo try and keep in other words how much is Schumer in company and below sea in company or are they investing in these negative ads about you\n[noise] well they put a fortune and I think by a ... by all accounts they're going to probably be up over twenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more we're going to look at the final ...\nAnd that's what happens on you mentioned earlier\nYou know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now the president came back twice he's actually our side we think is going to come back again and we start to come back twelve ten eight six to for\nThe two you know to even and that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen lives are voting began in West Virginia as it started yeah early\nYeah early voting started yesterday\nAnd so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have a lot of energy and people know that the future of the Senate could really be at stake what this election and that there's a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it we're not hockey\nBut we're going to out work Joe mansion and people are going to know on the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion he's a dishonest washing the liberal and he's never there when you need them\nAll right we're watching the race now put this in the ... column a where we once thought it was a leaning Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play\nAttorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda versus Joe Manchin sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a deadline and race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help a future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish all the best Patrick Morrisey\nHey Shaun thanks

to NATO to name your baby a Gillum Hannity\n[laughter] wasn't that they want to get a show and I get one had any\nLending Gillum Hannity I mean I looked at my work well revelations [laughter] I've looked at it the real hate has\nBeen coming from the left it's been ignored by most in the media has been very little coverage I forgot to mention the severed head of a president\nThey didn't seem to outraged about that most people\nAnd now there again there's just selective moral outrage be about Russia or being about\nSexual assault or allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric or action so I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroyed the president bomb the White House and I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\nHates them you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think there is no excuse for it you know I listen to every cut the just prayed and people are hard at work or doing the same thing that we have to be like she went to that extent to which the president has also made threats and it talked about violence\nAnd out of the I ask you when he was in ... and what you do is you give me the the predictable liberal talking point I asked you very\nVery specifically about all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we've now in the last month watch woman after woman after woman being run out of a restaurant by left wing mobs and the same left wing media didn't have anything to say\nAnd every one of those young rich as a matter of fake news CNN\nWouldn't let their anchors use the word mob\nWell because that's a token planned for\nThe call a point it's reality you don't win you know you don't have those mobs going after those people I Do I'm not going to defend it I don't think it's right is it a mile to be able to eat and find out looks like a month to me\nI looked at I think the presents unique talent police officers in Long Island to rough up stuff when they get into that kind of petty way you know calling the media the enemy of the people because you and I both know that for the most part journalists from across the political spectrum I just people trying to you know\nWith all due respect I don't see that I see a media that has been corrupted and complicit in advancing conspiracy theories lies and pure hatred of all things Donald Trump what do you see Jonathan\n[noise] well I'll tell you one thing uh I I Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs and that's a big difference in a mob\nMob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do a certain thing but in this case these people have organization they don't just show up somewhere a ... once these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at\nUm [noise] uh it is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though\nI I Want Sean I think everybody needs to look at one thing or all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about\nWho to target and when I look at the at the response which you had and which I've seen from other people are when bronco bomber was an office\nUm in in the case of the shooter that shot a um the Mr squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders\nBut what you see here and I find that is so hard is that ah these devices have been put out there that somebody went\nThe distance to to put these things together to ah to carry out a plan covertly to put these things in place all at once and none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way\nThat is organized and now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever put these out there but the organization of their rhetoric is so\nDisgusting really low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and ask 'em was this rhetoric prepared it's a it's a very alarming thing\nWas that I got Daniel [noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the President's Day I think that there is blamed the light across the entire political spectrum\nAnd what I think regular people like me see\nI don't I don't well I deal with people who I don't necessarily agree with it I get my job's done I jobs that I I ... hot and somehow I managed to get around the world get around this country to get around my city without inflaming tensions are the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that they cannot\nIntentions of the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that they cannot get their job is done without this kind of planetary rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of victory all hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before\nAnd what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news a lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels you know I don't see much real\nReporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos agenda he's a he's been Clinton through and through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit and it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels\nAnd you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example but we've vetted Obama when no one else would we batted the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving opinion is part of what we do we're like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now\nAnd one thing that can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that when when something like this happens and all these Democrats are having these devices delivered to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the\nThe uh down below where they have the headline a boy with a reporter and it says that Trump opposition is getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump proposition\nThat that's the way that they're they're playing this so they're automatically putting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen I mean it it is it's it's it's such political\nUm distasteful rhetoric\nThat when you couple that with the things like McDonald's said with the things that are these politicians are are\nInstigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never it never\nHas said anything that inflammatory and by and large the reason his words are so ah inflamed is not because of him it's because of CNN and MSNBC and these leftist politician that go out and\nPump it up to something that he never made it to be\nWe're going to have to leave it there uh Jonathon Gillum Walter she no more thank you Danielle McLaughlin attorney a and a soon to be a mom for\nI Believe the second time if I'm not mistaken yet and uh and two weeks so we'll give you a few weeks often we look forward to seeing pictures of their baby will put them up
