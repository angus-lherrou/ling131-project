because\nThey made a deal with the devil let's play a little bit of Robert De Niro and the things that he said why been critical\nI mean he so blatantly stupid he's\n... he's a dog he's a pig is a con artist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has\nI'd like to punch him in the face\nI guess I'm not supposed to talk about that John\nI Know and but you know what let some people are hoping that\nAfter this election it all goes away it's not going to go away if what this is a bad is Donald Trump is a historic president and the reason that he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so it's going to happen is the presidential race is going to start right after the election November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big deal to people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nIt's all about feeding Donald Trump's so this race November sex is not just about control the Congress it's really about\nThe what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three million Trump voters that are out there need to get motivated to vote on November section fat\nThey should go to your website for Hannity dot com and see the top thirty most important races in the house and go and click through and click through to donate to the Republicans to match whatever the Democrats are doing to try to take control because yes race November sex is really about the next presidential race\nAlright thank you Doug Jones thank you John McLaughlin eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\nOf Pennsylvania and you see the stark difference between the southern tier which is why so many jobs this is where I was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in Albany that have just strangled our economy\nWe're actually seeing an uptick I'm a small business owner and this district our family business was started in Nineteen forty six\nOn I've been around the district I've seen I've traveled to a fifty or Seventy five businesses I have yet to meet one that hasn't a priest us for tax reform\nAnd they're saying we're actually these tax cuts are were reinvest thing every one of them is giving a race to their employees or opponents or both we're finally seeing a glimmer of hope we've rolled back on necessary regulation or we could really open up the southern chaired a responsible gas drilling\nA Governor Cuomo votes you know will not let it happen my opponent repeatedly thoughts against that\nAnd this is how scary my opponent as we get into debate last night he ever voted four times for government takeover of our health care which is single payer\nWhich could cost the taxpayers of New York this was bragged about by the socialist leaning guy who's to sponsored the bill will only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety two billion in New taxes on an annual basis\nIt ... [laughter]\nI said two billion and that's not what Ninety two billion when we're reading take half of your money anyway a guy incredibly are many ...\nThis is a solution not\nVoted four times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate you this is a radical you this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is that I support the president he's not going to support the president he's going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment caucus\nHe's going to try and write and with all these Democrats you never shown any effect on he's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job you get into the assembly now he's hand picked by Chuck Schumer who brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny neither of them have come to the district to help him get elected\nBut you know who came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president calm\nYou also had his son Eric I'm there and his daughter a bunk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why a mum having you on\nThis isn't the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win ... plus a Republican and you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district\nSo you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that is going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money up and talking to my colleagues all across the country the amount of money they're jumping into these racist or tried to deceive voters is really a it's outrageous and then my opponent star outspending me I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York\nUh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the top conservatives\nBut we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to witness elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we've got to support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains even upstate New York\nWhere we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping or small business community are small business humidity is about Ninety eight percent of my life the businesses in my region and they create most of the chops that's his name health is alive by Nancy Pelosi\nIs somehow the wealthiest said the only one benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo\nIs suing the federal government over the tax cuts it's because his wealthy donors wanna leave New York because they're not getting the lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight\nIt says this is a tough battle because the Democrats have the money to deceive voters and full that meant to think even if this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get to vote at its most important we can beat the wall money but we need a Republican voters to understanding each pick it up oh it's really really important\nRight ah Claudia Tenney a running in New York and unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com ... the main\nYou know ground zero seats that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so what are you we wish you the best things for being with us and hopefully we'll send in your back to Congress and eleven\nDays you deserve it and New York deserves it we don't have many good New York politicians at all\nUm by the way just going back to direct or re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real and that in fact they've been able to identify least\nSome forensic evidence including fingerprints which which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today a little more about that as the day unfolds here uh let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny is in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you I eat a lot and I have not been any\nPolitical sense whatsoever but these mid terms or I'm leaving me any court to get out and vote [noise] uh this and you hit on it every day I listen to it and not watching it or not but I Am I'm\nListening I Hope everyone feels the same way you do is four hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important\nThe same way you do is four hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home that's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home a half a boat for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve I've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shock the world than the media you know I see three scenarios that could unfold\nI had to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses a pick up seats in the Senate and\nMaybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win if people identify the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve you know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won\nEspecially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve or I didn't happen and you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side\nI'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff a Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country\nAnd we're not going to go away we're not going to cry when not going to be cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want endless investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth and then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this\nYou know election season so don't wait I'm telling you what's gonna happen we know the only one Obamacare we know they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states we know they want their crumbs back you know they want higher taxes\nYou know they you know they don't they don't really ... they're all things hating Trump all the time\nNot exactly in the best interest of the country to keep focused on that for two years but we'll do our best\nIn or we can win at all or we can lose it all listen all of us\nHere on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity and you don't pay to be a member but it has everything you need everything I Need

members\nHeld the girl and to others between the ages of fourteen and sixteen that say ... directed Hernandez revert to killed the girl is part of the sea panic ritual after she disrespected they're trying to satanism\nI mean you hear all these things are Steve Ronald make the public doesn't hear about it and I know that we've highlighted your case I think he once told me that very few in the media ever came to talk to you about the death the shooting death and the tragedy in the murder of your son\n[noise] yeah that's correct again you know\nIt's one of those things that that the liberal media they don't want to put it out there you see an end to cover it um you don't they don't want to talk about it it affects people like you Fox News um some of the the local affiliates for ABC and CBS\nThey covered it but the liberal media in them some of the mainstream media so afraid of this subject and they're so afraid to you know go against the narrative and and that's the big thing that that we want to change we would change the narrative\nYou know a lot of people don't understand it a lot of the crime is spilling over into our country\nComes from the literal war between the cartels on the other side of the border last year alone thirty two thousand Mexican died at the hands of cartel violence shock there was only ten thousand citizens of Iraq died because of the violence in Iraq so think about that we feel safer\nHaving Iraq is a border state than we would Mexico\nYou know it just it it ... it just seems to me now at this caravan and we'll see what Mexico ends up doing well see of this caravan comes apparently there's another one building behind it know Salvador\nBut the reality is the president has been from and couldn't be more clear the same with the vice president did not getting in we already have deployed and be done the deployment of troops to the border\nThere's any confrontation down there will not be caused by American troops will be caused by people that are not respecting our law our sovereignty and our borders um I Believe probably they will be some types of barriers put up in the meantime temporary albeit a because we had a wall it wouldn't be an issue at any point what\nYou know and and that's the big thing we're we're going to go on a charm warning\nOf working to go to a section of the border where there's maybe one or two strands of barbed wire you know this caravan yeah you're going to see them trying to overwhelm the ports of entry but what about in the middle of the night what happens when things die down through the day or\nIn the middle of the night what happens when things died down through the day or when people are busy with watching this\nSituation it smoke and mirrors ... they're going to go to these parts of the border that don't have any protection and they don't have a wall they don't have a ... a ... to speak up and we're going to flood into the country\nBut we saw the fence doesn't mean the thing at the southern border of Mexico where they just knocked that down and in charge through\nI don't think that's going to be allowed to happen here I'm sure there are contingency plans being made right now and I would imagine barriers are part of that plan and I would imagine there's many troops unnecessary to stop the invasion of the United states by people that are not willing to follow the laws that we have set out on immigration\nThe really sad thing is that we have other silence on the left\nAnd and even they almost outward support for people that want to violate our laws I guess that's what we've been watching unfolding with sanctuary cities and states and\nYou know here we are even criminal aliens I mean in the case of of your son grant or how long was the murder of your son in jail before he was let out and not handed over to ice\nWas shot it actually the grant never served it day in jail or prison for his his prior conviction\n... never served a day and and you see this all the time with a lot of these illegal immigrants they played it down or they use their status or you know their children they use their children I mean I've got an anchor babies I don't have anybody to take care of them you know they use this all the time and\nWell you know if you really want to talk about child separation edits and its finality um and the president was the one that fixed that even though it existed in the Obama and Bush years you're experiencing child separation forever there's no hope your son was murdered we we can't bring him back from the dead\nNo shot him and it it's like an old people I spend Christmas we put up a Christmas tree on grants grave\nI spend just birthdays and most of the other holidays we spend with him at his great I mean\nWe we don't that's the only way we have to be with him\nObviously you know anybody who believes in God it believes in the habit that he is with us all the time but you need a place to go visit him in and that's likely place\nAnd so you have all these angel families that that is what they do this is what they have we're never going to see that they get these these ... legal that are bringing their children are using other children and screaming about separation\nThey're going to get to see their children to get there going to be reunited by law within seven to twelve day that's by law\nI ... I just want to thank you for what you're doing your you know I listen to you and your strength and\nAnd obviously you're trying to prevent this from happening all we're really asking for nobody is against immigration we just wanted to be legal we want to be able to vet the people that come into this country they've got to be able to take care of themselves and we want to know that they have the best interests of this country and love of this country that we have\nAnd I'm not going to be a burden or a threat to any of our our citizens that are here and we don't have control of it now but anyway I'm Steve thank you for being with us our thoughts and prayers always with you sir you're great American and uh I I really pray for you and your family as I Know how hard this is every day [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "College Station", "day": "26"}
