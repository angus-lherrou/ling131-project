don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\nWhile this rush right but I think eighty eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle rose going that far out in a limb um you know the most recent survey indicates that in fact you have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually\nAre ... within about two points when the generic ballot\nWell if if that kind of the contest districts now we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not so much money and then we're not campaigning and I'm we're not making our cage or but but in the swing seats that matter\nA we actually are basically tied the generic ballot in and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter ... two things happening you see this little bit with Stacey Abrams uh in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit\nUm and and she is just very left wing cinema the Democrat in in Arizona for US Senate\nRefuses to apologize for urging Americans to saying it's okay for Americans to join the Taliban um what's happened in Minnesota now where I think you also may drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship\nA because she felt so there's just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around\nAt these patterns and I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where\nThe whole you know for example when we were talking about ten days ago you and I were that this was a race between jobs and march well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and if you watch the Democrats\nTo ask you can you know they could you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out there because it's too important wherever fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be voting and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets\nAnd you're either going to have great news all the way around maybe it's going to be split decision or you're gonna have horrible news\nAnd you get to decide ultimately what that news is going to be this is where your vote actually matters this election counts and you've been shocked the world again and I'm confident that that can happen that can be the outcome\nI quit break more Newt Gingrich on the other side and later pastor Darrell Scott David Limbaugh much more [noise]\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or or elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering that will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nYou know I look I I well they do run on a government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine it collapses\nBecause is totally unsustainable financially and will be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing they've come to a big idea and it's a really bad guys you\nKnow I agree totally All right um we'll be checking in regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate that she burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWell I don't think that that doesn't change the ... the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registrations for\nPeople who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about are the more trouble she gets to be\nAll right but I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich\nLet's get to our phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big time AJ Houston, Texas he was the star at the at the\nTown hall I was in we had a wonderful time down in Texas I saw big time AJ I saw a Rick Perry I saw Ted Cruz and there was a Jay came up on stage with me and uh you know I I don't know why I had a different mental picture of you\nAnd I mean you have this big huge massive powerful voice and you know what you're like the same size as me\n[laughter] how are you I enjoyed meeting you big time what's going on maybe a baby boy I tell you I like I I wrote rally last night yeah right was that oh my\nGosh I like I said about that uh everybody though it may be mad at that time and I wound up going to a Trump rally what it was ... out this world\nIt was unbelievable isn't there\nIs a movie I Know you you've been sort of you know I go but actually be in there that they show up on me I I ... I mean ... everybody was night everybody was beautiful I mean by a a child that's\nWhy you up on stage and everybody knew big time AJ from used an everybody in the crowd went nuts it was like you know I don't want to start your running for office with by the way may not be a bad idea at some point that you run\n... they're probably knock me out the box but it's funny you say that dark up that China two guy in it but yeah\nI saw you signing autographs it and I said I [laughter] I think crime signing autographs and then we brought Linda on the stage and she said I said Linda say\nNew York I said I think New York and she goes New York and I said said talk talk and say single poor single for 'em [laughter] that was pretty funny I was one of my lighter it\nOh she's so I was a great leader or or I filled out about it or her if all of which God\nI use it here on Sundays by the way not as sweet and that is every day [laughter]\nHey but they got a job or got when I told him were because that's a great way to wanting to John Madden\n[laughter] all I\nNeed is this you always have\nThis optimism this love of life this enthusiasm\nYou know I don't know I'm hoping two weeks from now maybe I'm maybe my ex expectations are out of whack I'll deal with whatever the results are not a cry baby Weiner and like these liberals after they lost in twenty sixteen I sucked it up when Obama won two terms you know we'll survive whatever the country throws at us but\nWouldn't it be nice again to shock the world wouldn't it be nice to say that the Republican not only are picking up houses in the seats in the Senate I'm pretty confident we can do that\nBut if we also prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker how sweet would that be how great would that be think of the feeling you'll have on election night if you spend the time and you go out and your boat you do your job\nEspecially I put up on my website the top fifty races that this is where the balance of power would tipping point ends up on Hannity dot com\nOh big time that you would say that while we're standing out there yet but they and they own the big screen ... ... ... you know the twenty six ... and have the ... sorry media basis or\nOh there was Christmas Day Donald Trump liar I don't trust in fighting you know very ... it's all over fake\nNews CNN and conspiracy TV MSNBC I big time I got her on my friend I Love

amazing governor how are you what's going on Rob\nHey Sean thank you very much for taking my call I just wanted to\nSay that uh [noise] you know the left I always like to paint the right as being a monsters or not a you know sympathizing with their poor the poor people that are coming from other countries that have horrific a\nOppression and those other countries and a very bad situations where we had the exact same stories for people who were on the list doing it legally with the exact same problems that I Do think it's a we should you know highlight those people's stories\nAnd you know get more exposure to those stories that are doing it the right way and say hey listen we draw the line everyone's got the same tragedies and [noise] or we will prior we will um disrespect the people that are doing it the right way by\nJust letting anyone come in\nYou know that you cannot allow them to do this they're not going to be allowed to create a mob at the border and rush the border and violent and let me tell you something if we had the wall up it would be\nMore safe and more secure for both sides let me tell you what I don't ever want to have happened and I have no doubt that many of the people not care of and they want a better life they're good people\nTheir government sucks there's no hope no opportunity and the government that gets so much aid from from us a lot of these governments that we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt\nAnd it doesn't ever get to the people where we want it to get to but the reality is is we cannot allow we are a sovereign nation we have our country that has built on a constitution and the rule of law this is the law the land we have a process designed\nTo taking people from other countries you got to first follow the law if you want to be in America that's it and and I know the Democrats are silent on the issue but most Americans agree that you know they would be precipitating a showdown crisis where people are going to get hurt I don't want anybody on either side to get hurt\nNobody wants to do some people hurt out we don't know we can't vouch for every person in that crowd we can't say that there are not people that are bad intentions that they want to bring into America maybe it's just\nThe tiniest the percentage what if it's five people at a fourteen thousand we cannot risk that and by the way if we allow them to Russia or border bone rushed the border and get in and we were ... reward that behavior will the next one is going to be fifty thousand that was going to be a hundred thousand and then we'll have what Democrats love open borders and then they'll call for amnesty\nWhen they think they have no future generations above ... we can't have it\nAnd it's got to be stopped at some point I urge Mexico to do the job now in turn these people around that's their job\nListen I Want to remind you off year elections are really about one thing and that's you turning out showing

I Believe and what he's saying I Believe what you're saying you cannot let a migrant and then and now it's ridiculous out of control but it's all about the whole coordinated effort and showing it so that the Democrats crack can't play their same game as\nYou know the ... you know the way they're using all of their their word to feel sympathy and build\nNests trust against the Republicans and trumpet so good at this he's just gotta make sure again there's a coordinated effort said that there is seem that people there and the military show of force start sending bosses start sending plane all staged they're ready to say the name that\nThis is his red in line and the fans just like Obama hat with Syria he didn't do that this is ... is is that and he's got to show this and handling is right with a really great quitting where it needed Africa\nI'm really not worry yeah of course I Do I mean we don't want a humanitarian crisis you know the vice president actually said today that\nYou know a Central American leaders told him that left us in Venezuela or bankrolling this caravan which wouldn't some you're hardly the Honduran ... president knowing the vice president that ... told the Washington Post the president of on doors told me this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras financed by Venezuela look\nBottom line is they should be turned back now but\nIf in fact we see they're getting closer and closer to our southern border we've got to protect the border we're going to do this in a way I I Know that is we want to have the best interest of innocent people and all of this\nNobody's innocent if they're willing to just brush our border Russia across the border we don't want people hurt we definitely don't want people killed and ultimately the people that will precipitate this crisis\nThey're going to be on the Mexican side of the border because America is not going to do anything to people that don't violate the law but if they violate the law there'll be arrested and I I hear what you're saying we should have food water medicine supplies\nAnd transportation back to where they came from and I think you can do it in as as expeditious way possible with them as much terrorists possible\nUm but I don't think any arrest ever looks good and if the people on the Mexican side of the border border one of confrontation\nWith American police and I said our military um our side is gonna win and you're right we should do it as passionately as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt you know a lot of these people probably come from nothing they have zero Toulouse here and that's a that's a tough position to be in and then you have agitator that or\nYou know they're not telling them anything that's honest and truthful that they're telling them they're going to get in and so they're going to be disappointed feelings and anger anger who's gonna probably be on display so we're just hoping to get it turned around before this even happens but\n... you know let's let's be clear here this is the United states of America we're a constitutional republic we believe in the rule of law and the application of our laws that's it Democrats don't like it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this\nTopic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talking about right anyway Patty thank you I'm Becky as in Tucson, Arizona next on the Sean Hannity show how are you glad you called\nBecky Hi Sharon how are you today I'm good what's going on\nWell I got a couple of things being from the border town okay that people don't understand about this\nIs ... that's kind of [noise] yes they come to our border but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV and chicken pox in life and not border patrol agents ... people that are working with him get exposed to this\nThey don't understand there's long term ramifications of them [noise] and I had a feeling of thought about why I'm Mexican Government is not stopping some\nMob it's because when they come here and earn money based and millions and millions and millions of dollars back to their family members that the wire transfers\nSo why shouldn't they stop them because they're making money off of it so I think we should stop the wire transfers\nLook there is a part of me having been down to where you live in Tucson the Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been ... I've ... I've reported on the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today I've been horseback\nOn the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today I've been horseback all terrain vehicle helicopters boats I'd been there\nI've seen them I was up close and personal when it turned out gang members were being arrested I've got the video of it drug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand the people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um\nBut the answer isn't not obeying or laws that we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America\nIs to respect the laws of this land and respect American sovereignty and respect our borders\nAnd that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that and doing the right way and they should have precedence over those that are law listen don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple and you know I feel listen to the world\nAmerica had the money you know we do so much already ... tunes are billions and trillions of dollars\nWe've spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America\nFirst we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can take care of themselves they will be taking care of\nNo America's never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood\nWas the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm but it is that we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have\nThe money we don't have the ability to do that anyway eight hundred nine four one Sean you want to be a part of the program Donna's in Iowa Don Hi how are you glad you called\nHi Sean thank you for taking my call I appreciate it a I'm a marine veteran ... semper fi glad you're glad you called\nSilver but like I called actually to echo what you had earlier reported about this uh being financed through Venezuela\nIn it that kind of reminds me of very good friends with the Venezuelan this is a rock Obama ... and it's kind of that field it it came up through him\nI just I feel that\nThis has got his his uh organizing skills written all over it\nWas an I don't ... you mean in terms of the caravan well the ... the vice\nPresident is saying today and and again I don't know who's organizing it who's funding it I Know that you know I get the distinct feeling that there are you know the the last silence on this is very suspicious to me you know why don't they speak out about protecting our borders\nYou know if we had the wall built you understand we wouldn't have to worry\nIf they ever got to the border that there would be some type of confrontation because he couldn't couldn't happen it would be good for people on both sides\nIt'll encourage people to follow our laws and respect our country and our borders and our sovereignty and at that point people go through the process legally and I'm not saying that we don't let people in from other countries I don't really care where you come from\nYou know you got to show you were able to take care of yourself that you believe in our values and you want to contribute and you're not a threat to your neighbor that's it pretty simple and if you want to come to America I don't blame you we can't take in the world's population", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "23"}
