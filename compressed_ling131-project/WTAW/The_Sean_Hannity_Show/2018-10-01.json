witness the anger and the level of anger that exist on behalf of Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these tactics against Brett Kavanaugh um\nIs that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people that are wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there are three clear steps here one is to communicate as you just did that this is about America this is the most important midterm election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in whether we keep going forward or we return to\nThis left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between results and resistance\nAnd whether people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that work to move in the right direction or go back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama\nAnd then third I think the Republicans should have an eye open next week we'll have sort of very positive think of it as a pledge of if if we were elected here over the next steps are going to take care of the next good things are going to happen and I think that there are enough things working between the administration\nAnd the house and Senate Republicans that we can put together a very good positive campaign chores or three part campaign which America do you want results versus resistance and a commitment to an even better next two years\nI miss this bigger things for being with us we appreciate your time as always eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program a when we come back my colleague my friend from the Fox news channel Tucker Carlson we'll check in with us we'll get his take on the news of the day a much more straight ahead as we continue from the swamp the sewer deep sea straight ahead [noise]\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be a race to watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist unit is going to happen because it had to happen\nAnd look like they're they're Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know elect Republicans black cross a cost is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr ... well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and\nYou know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen and now all of these allegations all of these solicitations\nAnd it doesn't matter like if Michael ... making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ... girls and then waiting in line to gang and trail raped them and that this was happening with a regular occurrence but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent\nThat it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to where I went to school at one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive ... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either and she on the\nTenth one was raped herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address and to what you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously people fall for the same gag\nEvery single time football and you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh really you're hearing really if there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in the space Twenty years\nRadical clearance that allowed him the codes to nuclear arsenal he was back at it\nAnd yet we need another on the basis of claims they have no sense to actually shut all men not packing Christine for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happens from him for people she says repressive off or say it didn't happen\nAnd no one has the brass to ask follow up questions I mean\nIt's a joke at is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it\nWell this is the point I either some said they had no recollection amber of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor Ford is saying about I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor Ford identified one person and that was mark judge mark judge having been in the room when the alleged assault took place\nAnd he has said over and over again that's not true now they made statements under penalty of felony\nAnd if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting to committing a felony so I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job\nAnd meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or a Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up but now they want to end it in that aspect didn't put so\nBut why are we planning along with this I mean they actually\nCan tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake and where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it's Lindsey Graham seems we only person willing to tell the truth but where the rats were the other night in Republican senators out there on television and make their case\nNot just for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth\nWhy are they were afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but\nUh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and as all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously I was a news division but\nI kind of look at what I Do is a talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it's straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions\nSometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews where people give opinion um we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to buy new things to flushed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life\nTo what my family that I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts\nHawaii every night and I dropped more than ... workers to really confusing time as I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump get elected ... who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learned any\nAnd so ... got mad at them are good for them but why we're so that's I that's what I did my job is to explain workers me and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think in the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I don't it like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talking\nA little bit weird that like all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence\nWhy don't you know they're you know what I mean there are less the nine ... there was no it was a handful of US Soccer there's not many and by the way there's

I don't think there's a person in the country that is not aware of what's happening right now as it relates to Brett Kavanaugh and ... even if they didn't watch the hearings they're very aware of what took place last week and if they wanted to come forward I don't know if they need letters from people to do so that's my opinion a\nIt's a yeah I think we need a full fledged investigation absolutely positively\nNo doubt about it and if we don't then we're going to you know\nLook we get the country we deserve in the end if you liked the progress that America has been making under President Trump then you'd better go out and vote and thirty six days if you don't like the radicalism that you see on display\nThirty six days if you don't like the radicalism that you see on display now the last Fifteen days\nFifteen days ago Brett Kavanaugh had a stellar reputation if you don't think they're going to have endless investigations into Trump that they don't want to impeach him there this is who they are what they do\nThey can run on their record when Obama was president for eight years 'cause it's a disaster if you want the progress to continue for the country\nFor the forgotten men and women I mean we barely have time to mention that the president got\nYou know incredible new deals with both Canada and Mexico getting rid of a bad deal NAFTA now you had to break a few dishes and he had to threaten the trade war but ultimately you got it done because\nIt was these what one sided trade deals and so if you don't say you're willing to pull out of a deal you're never going to get a deal done and the president is effective at at negotiating on all fronts I don't care if it's\nNATO and those countries that don't pay their fair share European allies countries of ours that have been taken advantage of us on trade issues\nIf you don't say you're willing to do it nobody you believe you and nobody will move but now he's putting America First\nIn thirty six days you'll decide their agenda is endless investigations impeachment open borders eliminating ice keeping Obamacare and they want their crumbs back if you want that than stay home I mean go to go vote on vote for the Democrats on\nElection day and thirty six days if you want progress to continue for the country and you don't want to give them this power which way which they will abuse then you can stop it if you voted for Trump two years ago everything you voted for is now in jeopardy and thirty six days they want for them this is\nThey want to reduce the twenty sixteen result they think it was a mistake they don't believe in happen\nSomehow we were misled and it's been two years even with Republicans in power of non stop never ending smears slander conspiracy theories ... merchant blood thinning of the president and the media is of course the willing accomplices\nIt although every step of the way I'm anyway Gina thank you let's say Hi is it Lee is in Virginia how are you glad you called\nHigh show thank you for taking my call I speak to you as a legal immigrant proudly voted for Donald Trump or just\nHave to say I have to say my wife and I have never been angrier never been angry with the tactical we wait on Thursday it was such a travesty think about discussing that the ...\nMan with two weeks ago was clean whistle and honorable ... as rent could be and I just want to wait for your listeners if the Republican Party not from yeah well you need to do for the legislative branch\nWhat we did for the executive branch finding Donald Trump to get the legislative branch because Donald Trump does not play by the Democratic freight book\nSo I Will leave with everybody that's listening to get out there and make it kind of different Congress that we made in the executive branch thank you for taking my call\nWell I think that's a good call I think there's a lot at stake and you get to determine all of you I don't get to I have one vote in a state that does it matter in a district frankly that doesn't matter I have one vote but if you're in an important state district your votes gonna mean everything", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "College Station", "day": "01"}
