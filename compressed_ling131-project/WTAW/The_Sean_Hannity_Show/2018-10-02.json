called Jesus is risen poll in the early church and\nWe ended up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and their bookstores everywhere a one quick thing I mean you do have that amazing talent but as I look at myself as a guy not spent my life studying the Bible um I read it now more than I ever have\nAnd you you have made this a part of your life study\nYes I just when I I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and and I\nKnow your car jumbled jerk like me [laughter] you know like Brett Kavanaugh at a\nShower and I know like a like a rock Obama's was part of the two gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and drinking in excess yeah\nThere you go in and so I just I was always a seeker and I kept looking for answers and and and finally I found the answers that that uh I thought were intellectual obstacles and I don't really think they were ultimately but there are intellectual answers reasonable answers and we can give\nReasonable answers to why we wave and were encouraged by uh the Bible\nPeter Beck told us that always be prepared to give the reader that you believe and there are rational reasons to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's consistent with rage and so I wanted to share with the game you can make this quick quick I I got on fire for the Bible in theology so I've been reading it\nPretty heavy on and off for Twenty years and I have a passion to share what I've learned and helped people accelerate their learning curve reduce their\nUh intimidation about scripture so there'll be inspired to read it so these look these Christian themed books I writer encourage the designed to encourage people to get in the Bible themselves\nWell it's worked for me although I have a long way to go this lady anybody that knows me knows that and by the way soldiers Greg Jerry I'm just saying Greg uh you're right on target a Jesus has risen poll in the early church on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com we've got Lindsey Graham coming up straight ahead\nIt seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes\nAnd the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mrs Ramirez\nWas calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself civil was Brett Kavanaugh so that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore\nIf they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nWell even the Democrats so I'm declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat next story\nBut on the original story the Christine forward a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding um is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing I told Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all or to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember a Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal with this party entry into Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm listening who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine foreign to counter this but they thought this was a big deal so\nLet's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeeze a who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christine towards a allegations so uh I listen I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out um that there is no evidence to support this did find out actual real evidence to support it than I change my mind\nBut I don't think it's there\nWell if you go through I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell\nUm now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to\nTo question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her but she pointed out he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues\nThere was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault happened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details\nWho invited for just a party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar\nIn as much as there's no corroboration they're a big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that Deborah cats as a friend sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters to the deer so and so do you know anything please call us and do those letters went out\nI Know please some core operation you know the ... case right in the time they said they call they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot\nOf uh people can look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing you know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that that the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they owe it and she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nIt listed a lot of the nation hours looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and the therapist notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage there with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checked the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name\nAnd she check the therapist notes and therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her her for remembering that after session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name that you're the only evidence\nThat it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course gave them to the Washington Post so they're probably no longer\nA confidential ... even even her account of how you finally mentioned it to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee\nDemocrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it is now because\nYou're on the river but that's what they say\nWell now we have the the democratic ... uh Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down there on Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants an investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ballgame and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about is drinking he said he liked me or he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drank too much beer but they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out correct\nSo if you look over fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here you know the ... question right go ahead with all\nThe things that he claims yeah I'm from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations to work to be truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking ... mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rock published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking trickier mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr as I got to let it go there thank you so much Byron York uh with us sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one shop owners

what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and and I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh could have been anybody this is much bigger it's about than stopping the Supreme Court\nConfirmation that's what it's all about they're willing to do anything to stop it and he's a liberal women these he kept wearing liberal women out there speaking like they speak for all women\nThey don't they absolutely do not end when the\nPress in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um this cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we are the ones for sixty ... since the Nineteen sixties women have the deciding vote\nWomen were the ones that don't like that Donald Trump's women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the end of it turns and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kind of that\nTogether and we're pushing back on all of this and say they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the whether or not I'd look the Senate's going to hold a vote and I think Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue\nWhat is it ... the the convinces them he's not qualified for the job you know the guy admits that he drank he liked to drink he drinks beers still likes to drink beer sometimes drink more beer that he should have drink\nAnd then people saying but he must have blocked out we know we did he's a liar he's a perjure right and now they want to investigate an ice throwing incident at some game you know back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I can tell you what were the one and two days and that is we're having a win for Trump or first ever conference here in Washington DC it's women for America\nFirst heels on ... sauce and women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to people that are supported the president and Brett Kavanaugh and Thursday were taken a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most\nConservatives are working but we're going to take a trip and visit some of the senators and let them do how we\nFeel about it and encourage them to vote\nOn his support to confirm Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings this vote on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our conference\nWell I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may even no I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report and when that happens maybe it'll happen for tonight when that gets an ounce will senators will get to read it\nAnd then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote we'll see where people come down on this shouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions\nThey don't make recommendations they just save interviewed person a B C D E F G and but in every case there's no corroboration in every single case after case there's inconsistencies\nAnd every single case is very problematic and all I'm saying is is if this is successful we will never ever get good people ever in this country who would like to want to do anything\nPublicly why should they\nSean I completely agree it's a political ... job and we need to stand up and make sure Republicans do the right thing and confirmed hands so glad to see Lindsey Graham\nStaying with the with the president and fight back for a change instead of playing on the terms that the Democrats said so and I hope that they keep up this fight and confirm Kavanaugh weekend anybody that's out there that wants to join us this weekend we'd love to have them and that just keep up the fight\nThank you so much a me for being with us we are very proud of collie is now part of the Sean Hannity show and she's the one that's answering everybody's calls and she's doing a great job and we appreciate her on the team as we do you back door busy telephones a cat\nAnd we appreciate her on the team as we do you backdoor busy telephones are Kathy is in Virginia Beach Virginia how are you Kathy glad you call\nSean and nice to talk to him [noise] what's going on a ... I'm very upset latest is going on like the way the Democratic party it's been treating this judge I'm\nI feel sorry for the men the men children son father that we have here that a woman is going to be paid I Would come out and say\nOh I was molested okay if that was my heart goes out but it was not by judge Kavanaugh I feel that I Know that\nThe Democrat and it's doing to them\nI Will tell you that we see it every two and four years systematically it's now when we come to expect that they want to smear slander destroy character assassinate\nAnd now they do it for anybody any thing everybody is fair game doesn't matter how young your children are does it matter what your that your wife is crying behind you does it matter that there's no evidence nothing matters a Pam is in Hampton, Virginia Pam how are you\n... ... ... points and I'll make a quick and then you can count on that first of all it's high school records matter why it matter if\nIt's a great point that kind of all what would I mean he was part of who he was part of that wait a minute he was part of the June gang remember yeah yeah that will blow remember I think we have the tape of admitting that\nYeah that they do now is critical critical mass of all where we're at the parents are the owner of the house or the houses I mean but he had something I just can't leave the kids were just ... in ...\nListen it's very very hard to believe this part of it to me\nThat again in the case of Julie's sweating it goes down all over the place with her story and well he was near the punch bowl so I I don't know he gave girls red solo cups that is not drugging that was the original al ... girls and gang train raping girls\nWhile he was in the hallway but I don't know if it was him he was there but I don't know it was near the punch bowl whatever you call the bowl this is so serious you don't make allegations that somebody is a gang rapist and then what goes on almost every weekend you know and she went to ten\nOf those parties and that she was aware of but\nShe didn't realize at the time why the boys were lined up in the halls waiting their turn to gang rape the girls that they had drug this is what Democrats won investigated and she gave an interview and in the interview\nShe gave multiple statements that were inconsistent\nWith a statement she put out last week\nAnd was backtracking from her original statement probably because it's so problematic you know you call somebody remember we use the classic example\nYou know when you stop beating your wife when did you stop being a gang rapist\nYou know they're trying to put the burden of proof on a judge Kavanaugh they've concluded he's guilty just by accusation and these stories doesn't matter there's no corroboration these Democrats will still vote against them and if you vote for him it's only an election year conversion don't believe it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "College Station", "day": "02"}
