for joining us great to have you with us we have a guess segment coming up with this war that let's take a look first at what is going to be happening in the canyons of Wall Street this week\nA not a lot happening on Monday we will get a some announcement on short term treasury bills auctions but other than that\nShould be a fairly quiet a day Monday in terms of new slow financial these low not a lot happening on Tuesday as well but on Wednesday we will get the report on the existing home sales no existing home sales\nAre important because they comprise close to Ninety percent of housing transactions\nAnd the way they derived this figure is they tally the number of previously constructed homes condos and co ops in which a sale closed during the month of this report will be for the month of July\nAnd I'm given the fact that existing transactions are like Ninety percent of all housing transactions\nIt is a matter of importance this figure it's expected\nTo come out and then you were rated a five point four to five million that would be up from the prior month and uh it's been clicking along fairly close to the mid ... lives\nOver the past year and a fairly flat lined experience with this one but um\nWe have seen a rise in pending home sales vending home sales will be coming out later so um\nWe could see some improvement in this number\nAnd that's why we are using a consensus estimate of five million four hundred and twenty five thousand that would be an easier and you have those figures that would be an increase of about\nForty five thousand over the prior month or less than one percent but still at a a healthy level\n\nWe will also get the federal open market committee minutes of their last meeting\nThis meeting was fairly close to a non event because it did not include a media conference\nNone of that because it did not include the media conference and as a consequence it was really an internal meeting where they look at the data but they did not make any decision to change rates\nThey did not make any decision to materially older monetary policy at the last meeting which was at the beginning of August\nBut the next meeting will be another story next meeting in September\nIt is quite likely highly probable that the federal open market committee will again increased short term interest rates if they do it will be interest rate increase

the Web it is America's money program money talk are Brinker along with your guest than a segment as older ms right\nOver his new book is the gig is up or go also teaches digital marketing at the University of California ... thank you for joining us it's great to have you with us\nThanks for having those why you wrote this book\nYou know when you were out there today I feel like everybody you know it feels like everybody part of the gig economy we're familiar with things like this over and help work that we look beyond that and you start to see that\nReally any on demand services are project based services that can be provided by anyone a part of this gig economy on second see how really big it is and I wanted to give people a leg up a way to get ... and the teacher of work\nAnd we use this expression a new uses expression in your book the gig economy tell us what is meant but it gets on them\nSo they kick economy truly come back and thinking of something as a gig right like might think from the attic gig is something that a project thing something that it's temporary\nHelp project on demand services that can be provided by anyone and when we think about it in terms of the United states ... we might think of it in terms of\nTen Ninety nine labor labor\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nNo you used an expression in your book a unique value proposition tell us a little about that\n[noise] [noise] okay so when we look at value proposition what we have to understand is that how all of that right proposition isn't inherit promise of benefit at a company gets its customers are on planes or business partner and we look at that and we say why don't benefit might have caught that\nA lot of time a cost isn't very muddled\nUnique value proposition says hey what is it that you are able to provide some one and not willing to provide or doesn't provide him route and that's going on and so the idea of why some lunch in particular\nIs incredibly important when it comes to understanding the gig economy and how to thrive in it because you want to not only get other than what you want to get chosen again in the Muslim\nIt certainly seems when you when you look at the world of that that is liberated so in recent years it's certainly a I mean\nLet's say common sense would tell you that well this has been great for entrepreneurship that this has really generated a a ... of a of a revival of the newer ship you see it that way\nI think it's interesting because in some cases you can look at the gig economy is kind of like a ... step towards entrepreneurship right I'm all for not working independently I'm working for myself and I can see as\nA cow I stuck up against buffet other will be for other people on care dot com or something like that but at some point even the getting hurt themselves will start to hire out or even before he become yourself eager you may become comfortable using something like ...\nSo you're actually becoming part of the gig economy without necessarily yourself\nUp putting yourself out there advocate and as you get more comfortable with that starts to proliferate and we start becoming more comfortable all of a sudden we see on both sides not only am I putting myself out there that's an Arabic and be as a as a everyone the host or an experience house but also I myself I'm going out there and\nAs that are going to be host and experience house but also I myself I'm going out there and using those services whether it's left all all those are the most popular and I find it hard to understand that beyond her in the rest of the world there are hundreds and hundreds of apps\nThat specialize in very specific types of gigs so if I Want to get a massage or something for that if I Want to you know find somebody that\nSettlers or something very specific I can find something for that so yeah that whole thing if there's an app for that certainly applies to the gig economy as well\nOur guest is Olga ... of University of California and her new book is the gig as a rise in the gig economy where old jobs are obsolete and freelancing is the future is that the way you see it the ... thing is the future\nI think that when we think of jobs in terms of job security\nI think that's what's missing now so regardless of whether I'm a freelancer on a traditional worker the surveys show that those groups don't feel very secure in that position so if I was promised the gold watch pension and I no longer have that then what's my alternative\nSo that's why I say freelancing if you try this idea that you constantly now have to do\nAnd what to quite frankly keeps your skills updated and be the best person to choose for that job going forward and then I Do you get chosen again and again and again on the teams so\nIt's not like you're constantly having to pick up everything from scratch pick up everything from scratch that yes make those relationships and have those great team move forward a move you fought\nOlga you have a chapter that discusses reviews rejection and redemption tell us a little about that\nYes so that there's nothing that puts more fear and especially a small business owners heart but I'm sure also all of us because we now all get reviewed whether it's a Lincoln recommendation\nFor the other what other people have I get with you on whether my place in the past even as\nA passenger right if you are a passenger of an era where you actually get reviewed by those taxi driver and so all of a sudden there's this new uh everybody's getting ready and\nThat going to lead to people behaving maybe a little bit nicer\nPossibly I'll tell you one thing that has a seismic shift there is a company right now outside of Washington DC called snack work and they actually higher so the company itself snack hires college students and then contract with restaurant industry and hospitality industry in the area\nBut let's say five guys burger and so now as a student I can pick up a couple of chef at five guys I show up at five guys isn't my employer Mac work as my employer so everything goes out\nSo I'm showing up for myself and my five guys uniform and at the end of my shift if that will will to re my manager to review my manager I don't know any other time in our existence that this has been happening\nYeah this is something brand now where the reviews got both with\nChanging world for sure our guest is Olga ms right of the University of California her new book the gay guys up the rise in the gig economy we're taking your calls for Olga at one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one\nGood time to call his right now one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one and you can speak directly to ... he and um discuss her new book the gig is up thrive in the gig economy\nWere old jobs are up slowly freelancing is the future your questions for Olga\nWhen we return one eight hundred knife report what do what he wants the money [noise]\n[noise] [noise] this is money\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book you'd want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright an editing go eight hundred lines or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author ... should get that the younger advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author service you get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nThis is John Green and if your teeth or steamed some coffee tea or smoking power swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shades even better there is no messy strip show trees that you have to leave in your mouth so now we're just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're doing to try and shrubs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nYou're white white smile will have your friends talking about how you look try at risk free\nAnd part of it I think about is the stigma you know when we look at what contract worker was thought of as right and in some cases still is but I'm seeing it less and less and less\nAnd when we think of a contract worker within an environment even a corporate environment they were really thought of is less them right like I don't know how many times I went in and it was the broken chair\nAnd um you know good luck finding an office supply and good luck getting invited to the meeting right but now it's a lot better with the tools that are available and I don't think there's the stigma as much anymore as there was in terms of going towards\nUm the contract work so to answer your original question I don't know if\nIt's possible to turn back those kinds of time and I think there are some opportunities here as far as getting to be known for what your best that and hopefully establish yourself almost as your own brand so that you feel secure going forward in what you do\nWell things are changing ... you will know probably better than most and you do you do we need to rethink ... foods because\nThat is such an excellent question you know you you hear somebody like you on mosque out there and they they would like\nFor us to have kind of like a living social wage because\nAnd it's not just this idea of the guys who caught I mean it's also automation right this idea that you know by some statistics Ninety percent of all jobs will be automated out or through artificial intelligence be be put to that place we don't really know what's going to happen because\nYou know every time we think we know something else happens and innovation happens and and other things kind of show themselves\nBut at some point we may look at it and say okay well if Ninety percent of our workforce if this is true right that Ninety percent of our workforce will look differently doesn't make sense to have a different type of social safety net so that people have a living wage regardless of whether robots doing their job or not\nAnd that will be an interesting conversation kind of going forward I can tell you that where we are today they're still very much a need for humans\nAre just old room is right at the University of California her new book the gig as a thriving economy were old jobs are obsolete in removing is the future\nWill you know back in the ... or if you've been around a while and you were making good money\nThey used to call you consult has it changed\nIn some ways yes because the consultant moniker that also meant that you were your own business right like you had a small business you are the one that was responsible for marketing you're the one that was out there getting that work\nWhereas now as a consultant I I can choose to be on a platform such as up work and let my work speak for itself and let that marketplace Dr\nKind of the pairing of the work to the consultant\nSo it's it's changed a little bit\nOf a chapter of moving from freelancer to him warrior told us a little above the\nThe concept really comes down to this idea that at some point if you're thinking like an entrepreneur then certain\nParts of your time are more valuable spent doing something else\nSo unless you get particular joy in you know picking up dog poop and walking your dog then maybe you think to yourself you know what if I hire somebody to be a dog Walker twice a day I can focus on this project and I can earn more by focusing on this project\nBecause that's just one small example of how you might hire a gig worker to further your own time but there are you know dozens if not hundreds of examples like that where it might make sense to do that\nAnd we're seeing that for everything you know something that was maybe with previously only reserved for the super rich or you know I think just this weekend I saw a girlfriend of mine who's a mom\nYou know jet out to Vegas with Mike Tyson on a ... a a jet that was a partial jet like basically something that you get on an app to get out kind of like a a a lift or an ... but for jets\nAnd I was thinking to myself oh my gosh isn't that different than a mom's a girl's fun weekend to Vegas with a bunch of moms now includes a jet and Mike Tyson like when did that happen [laughter]\nWell I have to ask you weren't ... iron might do the ball the does he [laughter] well ...\nThat's the whole point like there that the fact that there is a basically a platform or an app that allows you to buy a seat on a private jet and you might be sitting next to anyone including Mike Tyson is a is definitely I opening\nWas accidental but if you happen to be on the plane was on a trip that include was high so I Know because it ...\nIt's like it's like as if you ordered a taxi and the taxi shows up and Mike Tyson's already in the taxi but in this\nPart she knew it was a jet [laughter] ... so is there enough that I can use you a wind up to the ...\nI Believe it's called jet X.\n[laughter]\nOh that's too much\nTo borrow or me or you have a job or you just touched on time maybe you have a chapter things you're not going to think about time management is one of them almost little about that\nI think that when you work for yourself and especially when you get into where you're doing this a lot ah so you're either doing multiple side gigs or fight hospitals or you have one main kind of gig it's\nVery easy to lose yourself in this concept of just being lonely you know we sometimes take for granted water cooler talk and being able to just\nTalk to somebody in the morning or over a cup of coffee or whatever and when you're constantly divided by your laptop screen even though you might be sitting in a Starbucks right or you might be sitting in your home office it's\nSometimes difficult to combat the loneliness in that respect and also time management because now nobody's going to be looking over your shoulder to say oh you just spent the last two hours on Facebook [laughter] right it's up to you on whether you got kind of stuck down that rabbit hole of fake news or [laughter] if you\nUm actually focused on your project and worked at through so you know all of a sudden we have to be a little bit more adult\nAnd how we treat our time and luckily there are tools for that whether they're on your phone or your laptop or even within your browser like there is\nUm a there are several tools for your browser depending on which one you use that you can actually block social media during certain times so that you're not tempted to uh to follow what all your friends are doing and get a serious\nCase of phone mail fear of missing out\nWhat all your friends are doing it and get a serious case of phone now fear of missing out\nSo as a as the gig economy has contributed to a freelancers using special services we're just going\n[noise] yeah so you know it's still in its infancy but I noticed that as of last year um there was a couple of bipartisan senators one being fair and Mark Warner who looked at something by the name of portable benefits this idea that\nHey if I Am constantly changing from a you know the type of work and my employers not always the same how can I keep my benefits relatively constant so there there's that there's um\nA new type of insurance put out by the freelancers union that is more like a disability type insurance says rather than like an Amtrak where it's a particular employer and you know you hurt yourself on the way to work well what happens if you're a freelancer and you hurt yourself out on the way to work\nYou know ... whereas that safety net so we're starting to see kind of products like that emerge\nUm in terms of insurance and that's not to mention like a bunch of other types of services whether it's food delivery or you know getting your nails done or you know who knows what other services that might also cater\nTo a freelance workforce but those particular ones caught my eye because they're fairly universal and they need that we all have from an insurance standpoint\nOlga a solar money talks listeners across America oh what you would like them to take away from your book the gig is\nTo not be scared you can do it when you go out there you have an individual unique contribution to give\nAnd I'm so looking forward to what that is because you're just going to kill it and I look at connecting with you and telling I'd love to know about your journey and your readers are and your listeners are more than welcome\nTo find me on chunk of change dot com and um I'd love to hear from them\nWhat's the reaction of lord of the book over a very well and it's actually very that thing that is the most interesting for me is\nThe absolute um types of people that have come out of the woodwork that I Would not have said I Would have not suspected whether it's air ... on one end or um a lot of different types of associations like safety council where their workforces changing your mortgage workforce\nUm physical therapist Dr um you know people that you wouldn't think of art and that would be in the gig economy are", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "07"}
