especially at the ... the ... when you're out there on the edge of the closest thing the NFL and\nYou know there's a guy that can bring an op Ed Ed and we're going to see one we're going to say a

or I think Lincoln office and their first or second in I mean so it's it's it's both sides matching up a special teams and now we've got to take care of the ball ... place more football\nYou're talking about sweating Simmons on their defensive line but you also like their rotation same where you get to rotate your defensive lineman go down\nIf you look they play a lot of guy I mean you look and those guys aren't the game at times was white and some and there are not missing a beat\nI'm going to say that says softly as I can but next Joe has broken the heart of Aggies the last couple of weeks out how to contain him\nWhile I mean the guy they create extra gap these very physically toughie the downhill runner he's a great competitor and I don't know if you've ever stopping has got to try and containment ... does it matter if they switch quarterback ... well I mean not real I mean maybe what they do and there are a little bit but you know they're going to do what they do on our
