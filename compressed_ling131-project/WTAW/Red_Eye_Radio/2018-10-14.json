we get to that will take a look at the week ahead in the Kenyan Wall Street and uh we do have some data coming out that will get a lot of attention this week a particularly I think on Wednesday when the\nFirst revision of second quarter gross domestic product is released at eight thirty eastern time on Wednesday morning no the initial quarterly increase for second quarter GDP was reported that four point one percent\nThe consensus revisions war widow and the range\nIs reported to poor point to right now the year over year ready to real role in gross domestic product\nIs two point eight percent if this number comes in close to four percent uh there shouldn't be any change in that critical year over year number which is the actual annual growth rate of the economy adjusted for inflation now standing at two point eight percent\nAnd looking at a Wednesday morning also on Wednesday morning we will get an update on a pending home sales and a National Association of realtors developed a depending home sales index as a leading indicator of housing activity\nUh it's specifically refers to existing home sales not new home sales now pending sale is one where contract is fine but the deal has not yet closed generally a four to six week period\nTo close it contracted shale depending home sales will be announced Wednesday morning there are estimated to come in black no change on a month to month basis and um\nThat would be consistent with what we're seeing in housing right now which is basically we're seeing a a close to ... some of the recent figures have been a slightly up slightly down a lot of movement\nAnd that would be consistent with what we have been seeing now keep in mind that ah it's flat lining at a good level it's about learning it a\nPositive level has been doing quite well\nGet an update on job just claims Thursday morning jobless claims have been incredibly low for years estimate is shorter fourteen thousand so uh we'll continue to watch

nine to point a to point one\nA well we'll see how the market reacts to that but certainly the market does not like to see a rising inflation situation especially with regard to those indexes watch most closely but that that's the\nI agree I mean I Do think it ... it was a mistake\nI think if we look into the radical the statements by secretary as treasury secretary Paulson and the weeks before we look at it than than an keys actions he remained basically in Washington and the right up to that crisis I think there's a clear I think Newt possibly even the decision\nEarly on not to do another best friends in other words not to sweetened the deal not to\nUh take some of the really the worst asset softly ... books will to provide some kind of guarantee my own view is that um Polson spot this was really a reflection on the political price that they had paid the Bush administration to pay for the bailouts of Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac so to my mind is is the Republican policy really\nFeeling the pinch dishes election yeah they've done a true to you know spectacular active intervention and with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ... nationalized election and are they really just I think that they can want to pay the political price I think for a bailout of leaving and\nI think then there's another question that follows on from that which is if one imagines them having done to leeman bailout obviously that resentment that share it with a reason to an even greater pitch I think\nThere's a real question in my mind about if they hadn't if the man had been bailed whether we would ever have gotten to top whether we would ever have gotten to a comprehensive recapitalize I should have the American banking system\nSo bad as it was and I agree with you I think it was a mistake not to bail leaving the effect of not pay they leave and was really to force everyone to look over the cliff\nOr having look type the cliff then we moved to a much more radical kind of a intervention with top\nAnd of course a there was an irony and all of this as you well know because within within just a couple of days a few days of deciding not to say layman and then subsequently seeing the global the credit markets freeze within twenty four hours\nAnd then they're faced with ya I G\nExactly no I mean I think that switch back is is just dizzying 'em\nAnd you really I think see you know Monday morning that's still celebrating the treasury that they'd had enough to leave and go ... talks about pulse and number two talked about it being a good day to go to work in the treasury and then within twenty four hours with a A R G\nOn the point of failure and I would have been in trouble I think whether we're not leaving a was allowed to go bankrupt\nUm because he was basically just getting ... calls on the on the credit default swaps that had written a days we're going to be cold weather will not even failed\nUm they they there's an about face a complete change if if you change your mind it's a really it's a it's a whiplash or an incredible reading the ... decision making at that moment\nAnd our guest Adam too is joining us from Berlin has written a book\nOn a vast array of topics related it's titled crashed how a decade of financial crises change the world uh we've also debated on this program with various or help from I'm from I guess the the topic of of of whether the Federal Reserve\nDid function in the end as the lender of last resort in the financial crisis given the fact aid that leaving was let go and be a the financial crisis was such a total disaster what are your thoughts\n[noise] no I mean I think this is the one\nArea of well why won't have to say that the ... the Federal Reserve it didn't just acted acted on it really historic scale I mean it is one of the appointed functions of central banks legitimate uncontested and uncontroversial to act as a lender of last result in a situation of a bank crown no bank officer real\nEven at very well run bank with very solid a with a very solid balance sheet can survive bankrupt or not what we have a Federal Deposit insurance pool to prevent the positives running [noise] and that's what are the lender of last result function of the Senate\nWell to prevent the positives running and that's what\nAre the lender of last result function of the central bank is full over spectacular about what the fed it at a rate is not only that it went on a normal scale trillions of dollars in liquidity to us banks but it did it for the banks of the world it provided\nTrillions of dollars of liquidity to all of Europe specs I'm beginning in December of two thousand and seven um directly to that brought you in New York and then indirectly by way of what a circle water cooled liquidity swap lines or to the central banks of Europe are and in doing so it\nReally is zero lost to the fed up to the fed 'em\nWith collateral or at all times so minimizing the risk if possible um it really enabled the banking system to come through this crisis without that there is no back ready that would have survived it alright\n... why do you think Adam that the Federal Reserve received such a huge push back against what they did in the financial crisis I mean they had been demonized constantly by many in this country\nI think basically because what it revealed is this profoundly disconcerting fact about the ... financial system which is being literally true since the early Nineteen seventies which is the money is not founded on any substantial basis it doesn't have a material in the ...\nThe ... goal sitting in the Federal Reserve's ... volts which guarantee the value of money money is founded on the ... the authority of the American state and on the confidence that he's maintained across the entire economy by a faith and confidence in the south manage\nManagement of the monetary system and there is something just\nVery disconcerting about the elasticity that that implies goes in a crisis it's also a great advantage to have a mother tree system which can expand on that can prevent um\nThe sort of catastrophic deflation which America suffered in the Nineteen thirties but deep down I think many people find it extremely difficult to reconcile themselves to walk in the end does put huge discretion\nOr in the hands of politicians and the officials that they appoint\nAdam do you think that Mario Draghi with this whatever it takes the infamous quote did a better job\nIn well I mean in the end Mario Draghi came through but that was off the uses of failing and another even more fundamental function of central banks which is a central banks of the market may careful government that\nGovernments are legitimate issue debt purposes of managing public finance the needs to be a agency that stabilizes that market and the fed the bank of England the bank of Japan to switch national bank will provide this as a matter of course to that governments um the ISI pie\nIs placed in such a peculiar position by its constitution\nAnd the people running it before marriage rocky was so conservative in that conception of the agency's role that they refused to provide that support to such in a sustained way for the European bum bucket and it's that\nHave you on that power which essentially is responsible for the panic and the sovereign debt markets of Europe between twenty ten and twenty twelve will draw was eventually finally doing was saying that at this point the construction of Europe the\nConsolidation of its fiscal comes of it of its called fiscal constitution is such that I can do what any other central bank with oyster Ninety whatever it takes a to stabilize the market so it was very light it was better late than never but it really was very late in the day\nOr get them to choose a Columbia University his new book is crashed how a decade of financial crisis change the world and we're taking your calls after the break for Adam on our toll free line\nYou can talk directly with professor animals too on our whole line from one either in among for surveying was one\nOne eight hundred nine read for twenty two Twenty one that's the number of calls and talk directly to Adams who's one eight hundred nine recently was one of these issues wanting one will return to our discussion with us is in my money [noise]\nDiabetes high blood

is it big blue dot com remember big lose IQ he's on managed to\nBring them in storage [noise]\nI Need to follow is the vast majority of people have most of the equity most of their assets most of their wealth in the real estate I don't miss the old and a very large part of that at least these leverage three mortgages to find yourself in a situation with prices falling is really a death now for for households that consume is\nYeah and in a simple model a one hundred thousand dollar property where you put twenty thousand dollars down that if that property declines in price like ten thousand you've lost half your equity\nExactly yeah it's a disaster absolute disaster our guest is Adam twos in his new\nBook crashed into a decade of financial crises changed the world and them you mentioned World War two which is my opening to one of your prior books the wages destruction the making and breaking of the Nazi economy\nWe talk about this from time to time with guests on the program over the last three decades plus but I've always been amazed\nAt the way that the um the salient advice of John Maynard Keynes following World War one about how to how to go about handling the mess that he\nFaced after World War one particularly from an economic standpoint\nAnd the way John Maynard Keynes was so so perfectly brilliant in assessing the situation unfortunately\nHe um he was ignored and we had World War two and given the consequences this is what I really am impressed by given the consequences of ignoring\nThe meaner kings line of thinking when how subtle or reparations in the rest of it economically it in a World War one of the consequences were well beyond the pale or how did that happen\nBut I think that the the really key issue here and it's one with a certain amount of contemporary resonance is into governmental that so they're really difficult thing to resolve all debts owed between governments\nSay not governments money to markets because in the worst cuts circumstance that you simply restructure we did this in the Latin American debt cases of the Nineteen eighties\nUh Mexico in the Nineteen nineties if a government eyes money to bank the some way out by means of a debt restructuring\nThe real problem after World War than it was a toothpaste problem was money owed for government to government\nSo the two parts of the problem was that the British and the French fighting alongside the United states has its associates a contract to huge debts with the American state but the American taxpayer and then to all saw offset some of that debt but and they\nImpose reparations on Germany and all of these states in the Nineteen twenties a democratic states that\nHave like two parliament's which have to pass the tax is necessary to service the stats and so at that point I financial obligation gets translated into a political obligation or an and between sovereign states each one of which has to decide to sacrifice a large share of its GDP um to\nTo ah to a service those that are in the case of the U.S the money that it led\nTo the British and the French constitution of full could fetch will get that are in the Nineteen twenties so this wasn't something that you could hide anywhere\nUm if the British and the French didn't buy it than American taxpayers will get to have to pay it and that I think is the really untangle ... the real the real problem of into governmental debt and the agony of course is that that's exactly what we see in the euro is I'd today that Greece has just come out of its special measures it's notion Lee at least\nUm you know in a normal state now rather than being under a crisis regime\nThe de facto it's going to be paying back money\n... advance to it by the other governments of Europe for fifty to sixty is for the fussy about future for the most the rest of this century\nAnd that creates incredible political button a between those states it's very difficult to avoid the buildup of animosity\nNone affects the standard of living for decades to come and Greece\nIt absolutely does yeah it means that a public services will be squeezed uh taxes will be high or\nA Greece has very high tax rates right now which of course that instance investment so it creates a deflation make climate um increase uh for the fussy about future I asked him to the twenty fifth these I mean so I really for generations to come\nMy aim here is not to get political in any way professor but when you look at the situation going on right now with trade certainly is a unique situation where we have a one country the United states\nLaying down a terrorist soon steel and aluminum or we have ah the makings of a potential trade battle between the United states and China we have a lot of balls in the air right now what is what is your assessment\nI mean I think they really remarkable thing about it um is that the Trump Administration should have chosen to pick a hold of these fights that once I mean it's easy enough to see why the Americans might have a beef with the residual terrorists or all of American vehicles are being traded back and forth with Europe\nOr the camera administration was trying to renegotiate NAFTA renegotiate NAFTA\nThe Europeans and the Americans couldn't agree that you know trade with China is a rather one sided thing for the love of the time and has been a history of China riffing off other people's idea and it was very good reasons to west and has\nTo be concerned about the rise of mental ... regime which seems bent on ... and it looks a little dominance in strategic areas all of those uh each one of those separately as a legitimate concern\nWell it's astonishing is that the White House citizen Washington should have chosen to sort of lash out indiscriminately against everyone civil tiniest say\nUm which makes it very difficult to create the kind of alliance says that um you know a a necessary ready to make progress in bargaining I mean the America's position versus China will be much stronger was alongside the Europeans the camera administration was using the TPP Pacific Pacific\nTrade deal to gain leverage either in Mexico and Canada in\nNAFTA to address February of grievances within that trade deal the idea was to trade off concessions to them in TPP against concessions in NAFTA all of that kind of gets taken off the table if you'll see ... the picking fights with everybody\nDo have concerns professors that we could be headed for an actual major trade war\n[noise] and I think at this point what has to be concerned I think one will say that needs to say that the\nLikely impact of that on global growth in you know I I don't gripe and the United states is probably not as extreme as one might imagine I mean it'll be very bad individual industries which made decisions nice to nice to be the auto industry which has traveled across North America with\nFacilities in Canada Mexico and the United states\nBut if you gave the auto industry and you trade regime they'll adjust to it and the same way as they had to the existing won the uncertainty Israeli it would affect investment but it isn't really on the train\nThis thing on the uncertainty Israeli would affect investment but it isn't really on the trade so I that I worry that the ... to me about the global economy is all about finance it's all about the effects of a strong with all of the increase in interest rates in the United states and the impact of that on people across the world\nWho borrowed dollars it's from finance I think an exchange rate's not from trade that you get the really big batch shocks historically to like what grade\nAre against\nIs professor random Tuesday to Columbia University his new book crash tell a decade the financial crisis change the world\nAre looking ahead at this Brexit mess in the u._k. a professor or what are your thoughts\n... it is a mess I mean it is\nAn extraordinary message to find any other words for it um\nIt just stretches ... I think the Europeans have always imagined that have the British having made this extraordinary decision but at some point come up with a viable bargaining position [noise] um it just doesn't\nSay fall look as though London is really in a position to deliver that they're all ... problems specifically about ... with the\nRelationship between Northern Ireland to the republic of Ireland the relationship between the Northern Ireland and the United kingdom simply being incompatible with each other and the British I think imagine that the\nBrussels within the fence or a ... a surrender or the Irish would surrender but the reverse has happened Brussels is basically authorized the republic of odd and to make the\nFinal coal to veto any agreement that defines unacceptable Salem that I think finds itself now in a in a position of week with the likes of which I mean it's\nDifficult to think of any prior moving to which that position as being as [noise] as weak as it is that there's a very real possibility is that I\nHave I have a hard Brexit I'm with key elements in the supply chain of pharmaceutical pharmaceuticals and food being in and out there is serious contingency planning going on right now to ensure that the British health service\nUm has adequate supplies of medicine and that the ... even a concert and Israeli is really beyond belief at this point\nOne of the things most discouraging about this is an awful lot of time here for a solution is to be found for a alternatives to be discovered and yet they they seem to be up against the stonewall inn is\nYes I mean I think well the the problems are genuinely difficult if you integrate the economies as closely as the European economies all integrated and if you then try and step half of that integration the technical obstacles are absolutely massive I mean I think really probably having had a look at it", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "14"}
