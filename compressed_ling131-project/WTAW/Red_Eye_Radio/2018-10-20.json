educational education we go through the federalist papers you know what the founders were thinking let's get into where all the way the federal is forty seven written by but been by James Madison and this one is really fascinating because it talks about the original concept of separation of powers\nMadison says the journey is a failure of the separation of powers he says quote the accumulation of all powers\nLegislative executive in judiciary and the same hand with her one of your money with a hereditary self appointed or elected may just be pronounced the very definition of charity\nIn other words if you have a branch that his irrigated to itself judicial power executive power and legislative power that would be a charity and he says that if the constitution were really charge but with the humiliation of that sort of power\nThat it no further arguments with the necessary to inspire a universal representation of the system you don't say listen they're part of the executive legislative stuff in parts of the legislative executive stuff in part to where the judiciary does legislative stuff but if they\nIrrigate extended and exclusive power one of the other branches that his journey to quote month askew French ... who was the progenitor of this idea of checks and balances his meaning as his own words import and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example and as I\nCan amount to know more than that now where the whole POWER UP one department is exercise by the same hand which possessed the whole power of another department the fundamental principles of a free constitution are Vernon\nThis would've been the case in the constitution it down and by him if the king was the sole executive magistrate and also possess the complete legislative power or Japan administration of justice\nMom tissue objected the merger of the executive and legislative so here's a quote from us you when the legislative and executive powers are United in the same person or body that can be no liberty because the apprehension they arrive at the same on our or Senate shouldn't act radical law to execute them into tyrannical manner\nAnd one of the power of judging joined with the legislative life liberty and the subject would it be exposed to arbitrary control for the judge would then be the legislator or join the executive power the judge might behave with all the violence of under pressure\nSo the argument right now in the United states is whether this is what actually happened with the executive branch the executive branch basically legislature not basically they do the regulatory power the executive branch is legislative power now you can argue that's not the whole legislative power because Congress confirm that\nCongress has failed to Trump that you actually would like to see check and balance again Congress has to take back some of that power Congress is doing some of that under President Trump they were involved in in a legislative move where they basically were knocking down regulations that are pretty rapid rate that's good unnecessary\nExecutive power has also gain the judiciary power given ministry of agencies but their own hearings board\nThis is one of the reasons why there's been a lot of focus on a case called ... ... the Supreme Court case in which the Supreme Court to just at the judiciary has to grant administrative deference to administrative agency so you have a case in front of the EPA go to the EPA board\nBPA administrative board gives you a judicial decision the question is whether the judiciary confirm that decision Chabot says many cases no that's why she ever on his wrong\nIt's like justice Gorsuch as opposed Chevron it's why justice cabinet opposes Chevron Chevron should be struck down just for these checks and balances to be restored irrigation of too much power in one branch\nIs the essence of charity that remains true today as one of the constitution was written so if you feel like everybody is taking crazy bill\nThat's because they are so I'm about to play for the worst at in political history this thing is hot garbage this is an ad that is currently making its way across the ways in Arkansas and it's targeted at black voters yeah just run on behalf of congressman French Hill from this kind of an unnamed group\nIt so bad it's great so here's the ad for a congressman branch off from black Americans for the president's agenda\nHusbands fathers when a white girl lives on the girl why Democrats won't be let you in black folk again turnout always told marchers don't be matched went around with that if you get caught she will crime rate I'm voting to keep Congressman Frank chair and the Republicans because we have\nTo protect and men and boys we can't afford to let why Democrats take us back to the bad old days of race verdict life ... ...\nWhat a white girl screens right\nOkay well in the French show to his credit and to hit in the fact that he cannot that data bad I have nothing to do with that ad solid stuff there\nWhich is pretty spectacular ads in the last election campaign had went and we had the guy who's doing cocaine ... which was just amazing it's top took aim at anything about it rather than cocaine that's coming up audio from our Sunday specialist juggle willing really fascinating stuff will play some audio that friendship Hiroshima [laughter]\nJust it's it's been it's been well read to how much your\nLeadership do you think is just natural to you because you're talking about it ... one hearing is obviously a guy that's tremendous initiative from a very young age mean teach even before a place where nobody goes in the military is joined the military takes a lot of cuts the as his life oh today and so what do you think that it really is that leadership is its borders bread\nYeah I did after squash and all the time and so it's both\nIt's absolutely both and you as a human being are going to get certain characteristics\nThat are gonna make you a good leader and you're gonna lack some characteristics that would make you a good leader if you add them you don't get hands across the board you know it's like the little video games you see kids play where you get a nine and strength than I Am a seven an intellect than a and an eight and dexterity\nAnd you get those too as a leader\nAnd you don't get all town so some leadership characteristics that make you a good leader for instance obviously it's good to be articulate if you can express your message clearly to people that's going to help you from a leadership perspective if you have some natural charisma that's going to help me from a leadership perspective if you can look at complex problems and you can simplify them\nThat's gonna be helpful as a leader because that's what you're doing so if you're a persuasive there's all kinds of things that will help us leader and you're not going to be good at all and so\nAs a leader if you look at the ones that you're we've got you can improve um that's that's what's beneficial so you can't take someone that's just a horrible leader and make them into amazing leader\nBut you can take someone that's a a decent leader and you can make them into a very good or even an exceptional leader because how you know you can definitely get more articulate you can definitely get more comfortable speaking to people\nYou can definitely get more more precise at taking very complex problems and simple find them so that your team can understand what it is it needs to get done but he's all things that you can improve upon and I always have to\nClose this out by saying that there are some people\nThat cannot become better leaders and the people that cannot become better leaders are the people that can't put their ego in check that they lack humility and those people they think they're doing everything great so they're not going to improve their leaders you can't coach him you can't convince them they think they're perfect then they're going to stay where they are from a leadership perspective\nSo what what did you actually learn from the first time you went through seal training is he joined the military and you decided to go to the hardest well what everybody widely across America knows the hardest training program America what is that like\nThe the the missed about field training that part of seal training is that you learn anything at all [laughter] 'cause you actually don't it's it's I mean you can you learn some things but it's a screening process what they're trying to do is get rid of people\nThat don't want to really really really do that job so it's it's suffering you're going to be doing going to be what you're gonna be cool you're gonna be tired are you going to be that for extended periods of time and there's an eighty percent attrition rate but when you make it through\nYou've you you get to SEAL Team and when you get to SEAL Team ... when you start to actually learn about being ... that's when you learn the tactics\nAnd the leadership perspective that's when that's when you start to become an actual field getting through the basic seal training\nAnd when you show up at a SEAL Team everyone looks at you you you come out of their thinking you like you just said oh I just went through the toughest training in a while you get your name I literally checked in with a master chief and he said everyone here has been through that training no one cares [laughter] show very humbling when you show up and that's when you start to learn start to learn when you get to see Oprah too\nAnd when it comes to you know getting into the field and how do you determine leadership position even among people who you're initially equals ... did you think that sort of naturally falls out\nOr there's a rank structure inside the military doesn't rank structure inside the seal teams and you're going to be aware you for you when you're a new guy you're going to be a junior guy and then the next will do and you're going to be a little bit more senior have a couple of guys working for you\nThe poetry and chief is going to be you know the senior guy enlisted guy in inside of a ... and then you'll have an officer in charge of the whole thing and those are pre designated as a pre designated which\nWas very counter to my initial thought when when I joined the navy my dad told me I was going to hate it because I said why do you think I Would have egos 'cause you don't like to listen to anybody and don't like authority and\nOf course I told him no doubt it's just it's a team we don't have to listen to anybody is a team and I was completely wrong because there is a rank structure and you absolutely you know there's a ... it's the military even though it's a team and you definitely have you built relationships throughout that chain of command and that is more prominent than in some other groups\nBut you still there's a chain of command and you're gonna you're gonna fall that chain of command\nAnd then there's been a lot of talk about the possibility mandatory national\nService has so many has gone through this program and that I've seen so many guys who are\nMilitary or something and I knew you know back when they were in high school and we're kind of you know I I Can't say the words that avenue and if that's how I end and then they come out the other end and they're yeah salad ... dental ... really making something in and says what do you think of the idea that mandatory national sort of\nI Love the idea of it but at the same time as an American I don't like the idea of mandating that people do something that they don't want to do and I and I think the volunteer military that we have right now is it it might be the best in the history of world we have a great military and\nI think to mandate it I think it's problematic that being said every single person that I talked to especially kids that are the age of you know Thirteen fourteen Fifteen you get the opportunity to join the military than I Would definitely recommend it because like you said it it it teaches you a lot of things\nAnd when it comes to you know the application of leadership principles how much of what you learn and leadership training at the seals was applicable and how much are that way you're just in a situation and now you've gotta you gotta you gotta figure something out and how much of a CD your pants kind of stuff\nWell when I came in we really didn't and it's a shocking we really didn't have\nA a a process of leadership training that the leaders went through\nAnd we would basically the leaders would learn\nOJT on the job training you would watch the person that was leading you and then what is your time to take over you kind of emulate what they were doing and if you had a great leader that worked okay she had a bad leader that was a real problem and so when I came back from that deployment to Ramadi that's one of the things I focused on his I realized that we really needed to implement leadership training for the guys because\nYou're on the battlefield leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield and if you don't know what you're doing you're going to get people killed without question\nAnd well what would sort of they can you give me a couple of stories to sort of demonstrate that point and what you what the high points of leadership that you've seen on the battlefield as opposed to low point you've seen in terms of leadership\nFor one thing that's important to to to clarify here is when I talk about leadership I'm not just talking about me 'cause I was in charge of the task unit or the platoon commander 'cause he's in charge of doing or even the people above me I'm Talking about every level of leadership every person taking ownership but there are pieces of mission and executing\nExecuting with authority and executing with with real like passion about what they're doing and so you've got to have leadership at every level and when you don't have that it it's very problematic so what was great for me when I came back and I took over the training\nFor the west coast you'll teams I got to see we we put on the most realistic combat training extremely stressful very realistic and I would get to see a platoon goes through the training and then the next night it'd be another platoon going through the same scenario and then that could be another button going through the same scenario\nIt'd be another and going through the same scenario and then that might be another person going through the same scenario\nSo I got it was it was basically the most incredible leadership laboratory it might be the most incredible leadership laboratory that's ever existed it was back awesome to be able to\nTo be able to put these these cartoons to this it would've trading\nAnd that was where it became very clear that leadership if you're in a good leader and it's the open to\nThat she would do a good job and by the way that leader didn't need to be the senior guy\nThey could have been a guy that was two or three rungs down but when things started happening he would step up and and take command and make things happen and as long as the other leaders maybe that were senior to them had the wherewithal to say you know what this guy seems to have a grip on the situation I'm going to let him run with it then it would be OK\nOccasion you get an egotistical leader that would be like oh you're stepping on my toes and they try and put them down and that will be problematic but you see\nA good solid leader anywhere and that she would make those tunes perform great and if you had a bad leader in a field do\nYou watch the whole tuned fall about apart if no one stepped up and took charge and made things happened this was very evident and that's another thing that just solidified the principles that we\nThe same the same principle that we teach the businesses are are literally the exact same principles that we wrote about extreme ownership\nAre the same principle that we talk to the young CEO leaders coming up okay so now\nJak let's get down to some of the main lesson leadership so what's the number one thing\nYou look for in a leader well the first book was called extreme ownership and what that means is you're not gonna making excuses you're not going to blame anyone else you're going to take ownership of whatever happened and when something goes wrong instead of pointing fingers and blaming someone else and take ownership of that problem\nYou're gonna take ownership of figuring out what the solution to that problem is that you're going to take ownership of implementing that solution so that is the number one thing that I'm looking for for a leader to do is take ownership of the problems and again we call that extreme ownership and it was one of the things that was very easy to see in a field too\nBecause when someone doesn't take ownership and first pointing fingers and blaming wrote it like for instance right now if I started playing my finger and blaming you for something what your natural reaction going to\nGet defensive get upset I mean it's not my fault that strike at it you know what I wanted to\nDate a guy who could actually and then what happens is we have a team where you're pointing the finger you your point a finger someone else now we have no one taking ownership of the problems and therefore the problems never gets all the opposite of that is when you have a good leader that steps up and says hey\nBen you know what this broadcast and go the way I wanted to I should have done a better job preparing to for your questions I'm Sorry I Apologize and now instead of you getting defensive you say you know what no actually I could have done a better job and now both of us are taking ownership of the problems and we're going to get salt so that's\nKind of a number one characteristic as someone who has the military when something goes wrong and you're a leader and you say oh you know what all this was bad situation it's my fault take ownership of it you have to be humble in order to do that", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "College Station", "day": "20"}
