[noise]\nPlenty to talk on your way each and every weekend talking about subjects financial we talk about how you can become your own personal financial manager and if you do it successfully you can manage your money\nFor the rest of your life somebody in the family has to do it maybe you are\nThe designated person the person that takes care of those financial problems saving for the future saving for retirement savings for the education of the young sprouts [noise]\nThat's what it's all about here on America's money program\nMoney talk\nThere are so many things that all of us can do to make the future brighter from a financial point of view and\nWe've talked about many of these topics over the years here on Monday talk and I thought we would just take a moment to review some of the key things that you can do to make a difference in your long term\nFinancial situation now we certainly talked about becoming your own financial manager that can take tremendous dividends in the savings that you can accumulate over a lifetime from not having to pay excessive management fees\nAnd also your ability to learn and maybe even pass on to family members some of the key aspects of managing your personal financial affairs\nBut there are a number of things that you can do day in and day out they can make a big difference we've talked about for example in the insurance area we've talked about the difference between term life insurance which is low cost\nAnd yet protects the breadwinner where the pay off if their bread winner\nMitt a meets his or her maker than the term life insurance payout becomes critical the lump sum payout of the term policy but term life insurance is relatively inexpensive\nAnd so this is something that is a no brainer category as opposed to spending a lot of additional money for things like whole life and universal life and\nFrom my point of view you don't want to use whole life and universal life is a savings or investment vehicle when we come to the topic of life insurance we want a pay out in the event something happens to the breadwinner who was the person being insured\nIn the event something happens to the bread winner who was the person being insured the the key person being insured from a life insurance standpoint so term life insurance very inexpensive does the job\nOf protecting against the loss of an income stream of a breadwinner that's what I recommend now also in the insurance category we've talked about things like automobile insurance and you can\nTake a a an automobile insurance policy and you can go for the highest deductible by self insuring you put that deductible amount aside and it can be in a money market fund for that matter it's just there in case you have to hit the duck double limit\nAnd that's that's what I was that's what I was getting it okay 'cause that would mean that would mean without commenting on that particular fund that would mean you ... you have a single custodian so here's the way\nLet me use model portfolio three sets the portfolio you were asking about yeah let me use use that and that's the portfolio that most commonly our subscribers used for purposes of using the four percent withdraw guidelines so here's the way that works and and I think it works a beautifully first of all\nYou have your stock market exposure you have your bond market exposure and model three and so that means you have\nThree sources of revenue\nThat are coming in each year\nGive or take from those assets one source is the um the stock dividends that are paid into the stock mutual funds that are then paid out to the shareholders so you have\nDividend income from your stock holdings so that's part of your four percent guideline\nIn addition U.S interests coming in from your bond holdings and that is interest income that's part also of\nThis ... percent guideline and then uh and this is variable of course but from time to time you have capital gains distributions\nThat are made out of the mutual funds mostly out other stocks bonds occasionally a small amount out of the bond funds and that also represents revenue coming into the account because all of this money and the taxable account all of this money is taxable in any way\nOr if it's a tax deferred account fine that comes in but of course everything that comes out um once you're at the qualified age comes out as ordinary income any way in a a tax privilege to count that is not a raw so if we're talking about a a personal account\nWe have all of this money coming in a sensible the dividends are generally qualified dividends they have a tax rate the interest is taxable and the capital gains have the tax rate depending on the type of games the short term long term whatever save all of this money coming in and here's what's going to happen\nIn some years it will be less than four percent\nAnd that means you'll have to sell a small number of shares across the board to make it come out to four percent in other years it will be more than four percent especially a year where you have distributions from capital gains it'll be more than four percent which gives you the ability to take you four percent and reinvest\nAnything in excess of four percent\nAnd some years it'll come in very very close almost identically to four percent\nThat is the approach that I recommend for how to go about a enforcing the four percent withdraw guideline which you want to review every year to make sure it's working very very important\n... called Pete always great to hear from the land of the money he WLS radio Chicago\nLet's get Tony on the line in Santa Clarita hello Tony\n... and I know that ten thousand a state local tax limit rural new thing\nYeah there is a new law that limits the deduct ability of state and local taxes of all kinds property taxes income taxes sales tax is a local taxes like wage tax is like the city of Philadelphia wage tax all of those state and local taxes now\nCobbled together can be deducted up to a limit a cap of ten thousand dollars if you have more than that you lose the ability\nDon't you think\nThat will encourage more people to buy new need bond so they could get back the money that they can't get back on their tax return and then that means that the bonds will be able to withstand higher interest rates better than they usually do when I heard when interest rates go up\nNot sure whether that's going to actually happen I Would say that if interest rates go up in a small bond prices will go down\nAnd I think that they will probably go down in the same proportion as they always do which is an inverse to their duration for example if you have fun with the duration of ten years and you have a one percent increase in rates I think the fund is probably drop and ... acid value about ten percent I think that um you\nUnder this probably drop ... acid value about ten percent I think that um you do raise a good point however Tony I Do think that the loss of folded ducked ability\nOr of state and local taxes is going to result I think it's already happening in people looking at relocating to low tech states because\nAh for higher earners a for a\nBusiness owners that have the ability to relocate I think that they have to take a look at that because uh the impact is dramatic\nBecause I figure like if you were five thousand over that made you just lost two thousand of of whatever quit or\nWhatever and the top in the top bracket uh in the top bracket and there's another you're right but there's another problem with that or to other problems for one or there are a lot of people that are way way more\nThan five thousand over the ... and limit there are states that are known as high property tax states\nThese are states where historically the the the taxes assigned to real estate had been far above the national average states like a New Jersey a which by the way it has the highest property taxes in the United states\nAnd uh as a former New Jersey I I can tell you that's a fact a New York\nOr California Connecticut these are all very very high property tax states which also by the way it happened to have high state income taxes and all so all of those have um a ... so you have all of these taxes you had this ten thousand capture your high earners take a look at this\nAnd they have to take a look they have to take a look at no or low cost DOMA styles I mean they have to because it would be a irrational for them not to and I think you will see re locations\nAnd this is one of the reasons that I Would not want to have a long term pension income obligation from the states that are likely to see ...\nNo ... in California there's a bill in Sacramento where they want to consider state taxes a charitable contributions to some kind of\nState foundation charity whatever like if the if it's above the ten thousand dollars and ... and then you can claim it has a turtle bought charitable contributions later than ... ...\n... there's a guy in Sacramento trying to pass that bill right now did you\nHear about the only he does he he ... I did and he does have a problem there are other states looking at this New Jersey by the way is looking at this and they do have a problem and the problem is it in order to get a\nCharitable deduction you're supposed to have no strings attached\nYeah ... ... for example well we're not wanted to go\nWell no no you're supposed to have no strings attached to the donation you're not supposed to be able to make a donation and I have no idea how the courts will rule on this this will all go through the legal machine but you're not supposed to be able to make it to a donation for example let me give you a really good example\nA you're not supposed to be able to make a donation of\nThirty thousand dollars to a a a church\nRight take a charitable deduction and then the church gives you a thirty thousand dollar car that's not a legitimate donation that's quid pro quo it's not supposed to be that way so I think he will face a legal challenge\nIf you tried to pass a law that says the taxes the taxes are a donation but in return you don't have to pay your property tax because that's quid pro quo I think this is going to be a a a legal train wreck that's what I expect\nMoney talk on

convertible bond funds are hybrids are they uh they they pay you generally a relatively low rate of interest\nOr certainly a lower rate of interest than you would get on the street bond from the shore and they also are depending on the convertible feature a they also give you a what's called an equity kicker and Wall Street which is the ability\nTo experience either appreciation or decree\nShe

L. P. I. field uh basically from a total of about twelve grand because I made a couple of thousand on the original ten\nI'm Down to about eight thousand I'm Kevin seven thousand eight or nine hundred so I was sitting on a four thousand dollar loss bottom line my question for you you see this coming back would you sit tight or would you get it out of there it's a very very small percentage of my\nEntire portfolio so it's not money that I Need my question is should I grabbed the cash and reallocate in my raw or would you just let it said the thinking maybe it's going to come back I I don't know what to do\nWell uh what about the income that you've earned over the last few years owning this\nYeah I Know that's a very good question and I get\nWell where where is that income where ... become\nReinventing might get in with vanguard I'm In my vanguard wrong and I just chose to reinvest all the evidence so I kept buying back more shares in his M.
