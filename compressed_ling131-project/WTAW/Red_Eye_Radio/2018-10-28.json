is critical mass and I think one of the questions that comes up\nSo frequently over the years on Monday talk is what we're talking about with reference to a critical mass what we're referring to and really we're using the\nScientific expression if you will in financial part lunch and talking about financial freedom and that's really what critical mass represents financial freedom\nThe freedom to own your time to do with your time you're most valuable asset by far not for sale your time to be able to use your time the way that you choose and of course to provide security for your family your

K. OH radio Reno Bryan welcome\nHello Bob this is really an honor\nI Am about to transition into retirement sixty three years old and I'm I Need to know how to re allocate or retirement on I'm going to more or less be going on your number three um recommended biased\nAnd move heavily from my\nEquity into some bonds and safer uh instruments because I Want to try to walk in some of the games that are caught in the last few years her from the market\nAnd I've got three main silos I have a ...\nA traditional rover IRA at a brokerage account and I'm worried about their brokerage account because I've got a lot of a capital gains in my brokerage account and that's heavily inequities and I want to transition that into some safer bond instruments going forward without taking a huge tax you had a possible [noise]\n[noise] well if you have long term holdings a well one question would be what tax bracket you'd be in for the capital gains do you know that\nUm I Would not sure but I Would say ... percent\nOf all that's not a very big hit when you're an about a citizen you don't even have to pay a state income tax so if you're getting out of it with a Fifteen Percent long term capital gains tax than uh you you've already\nYou've already won the investment game at that point where you're able to retain eighty five percent of your profits I mean there are some people in some states around the country they get hit over the head or twice they get hit with a\n... with double taxation so uh you're way ahead of the gay game on that one and that's what I Would be inclined to do now you referenced a model three or something while you were talking I think about model portfolio three page a page jaded the investment letter and that for the initiated\nThat is a balanced portfolio which essentially is invested in the stock market through no look mutual funds and also in the bond markets through no load bond funds and right now\nWe've been using a short duration but I Would say that a at a Fifteen Percent capital gains tax rate I really think you're a winner\nI Would say that a at a Fifteen Percent capital gains tax rate I really think you're a winner Brian all the way\nI appreciate that I uh I I feel better\nUm which would you agree that the the ... is where I should retain most of my um more aggressive equity\nStuff going forward in other words that would be for down the road or tapping into that later and then my traditional i._r._a. and how to put a mixture of equities and you know morgue rescued stuff in there and and I should put them the more bond and safer stuff in my brokerage account or when I go to start moving stuff around here [noise]\n[noise] well I think that uh one of the things you want to keep in mind is um I mean first of all let me address your\nUh your effort to nuance between the raw than the traditional ... holdings uh I'd be more inclined to take a a a an equal approach between the two funds I think trying to nuance between a raw that a traditional\nIs a probably a\nA analysis paralysis that's the way I Would look at it so I I'd be inclined to just just go down to ... down the middle on that\nBut keep in mind that when you talk about um the personal money that you do want to try to put your most taxable vehicles for example bonds are totally taxable\nIf you're in the the bonds and the newsletter that we're using in the model portfolios those are taxable bond funds so if you're doing that\nThen you want to try to put the most taxable investments the ones that are going to hit you right away with tax liabilities\nIn that calendar year you want to try to put them in my opinion into your personal account a I'm Sorry it to the attacks privilege to count as what I'm saying and did the tax privileged account so you don't get hit with those tax liabilities right away\nWhereas in the personal account as you've already a documented with your very small capital gains rate of Fifteen Percent a year in a position to take advantage of the tax law there so I think that does make sense\nTo put the investments in your personal a portfolio that are going to get the ... are going to benefit the most from the tax law\nOkay well the thing is is that I Can't really move more money into Iraq without doing a conversion\nOh I don't want you know I don't want you to I don't want you to do something dramatic like a conversion because of anything I said all I'm saying is you do the best you can you're not going to be able to do this perfectly you do the best you can\nYeah and the ... the the the regular traditional areas roll over from four one K. and that's kind of way I Can't put more into that either so\nWell that's not really the plight of adding to those accounts is not what I'm Talking about what I'm Talking about is developing a strategy where you can maximize the tax benefit\nOf your accounts and you certainly have a big tax benefit in your personal account because you were only hitting with a Fifteen Percent capital gains long term rate right and I thank you for the call always great to hear\nFrom Reno nevada\nJust outside of Lake Tahoe\nFor information on my investment letter above
