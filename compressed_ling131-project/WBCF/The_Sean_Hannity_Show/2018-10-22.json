and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the

clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leo buys for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspapers say the caravan now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do weight\nThat would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance they appear confident that\nThis confrontation is gonna come down to this is there's this extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh mattered they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans instinctively don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country\nDon't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to

thing one thing about this because they've always supported open borders now do they not know that by ... precipitating this confrontation\nThat there could be innocent people that end up getting hurt here\nI guess for them they would use that as just another reason to hate and blame Donald Trump\nYou know or maybe they're hoping that Trump won't do anything and then it's all talk no action they don't have any legitimate claim for asylum in America because you that would be the first country they go to the way they have so we can send them back immediately if we have to\nBut if you have five seven fourteen thousand people confronting our troops along the border of what good is going to come out of this\nYou know it's some you know while they're breaking the law they're criminals there not respecting our laws and our sovereignty and at the end of the day\nIf you let in ten fourteen thousand what's gonna happen next week and what's going to happen in the week after I think you know the Democrats have always believed that the change in ... in you know allowing illegal immigrants in the country of somehow helps them politically in the long term\nBut I don't think the American people want to open borders the American people fundamentally believe in the rule of law the American people believe in immigration but they want legal immigration\nAnd when they see the magnitude in just one crossing and then recognize that this was happening every single day at our borders to me this is going to energize the more to want to go out and elect Republicans that will fund fully the wall\nPresidents only had three and a half billion dollars so far to build the wall he's trying to get Congress to give them twenty five billion gets the twenty five billion enough to fully completely secure our southern border\nDoes that mean nobody ever gets in not at all we just want legal immigration want to make sure who you are when you come here can you take care of yourself and do you come here and share our values and do you want your piece of the American dream then fine\nSo you got a Democratic Party now that is ... ... believes that nothing is relates to due process cabin all\nKnow
