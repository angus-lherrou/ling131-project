Schumer\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he has dispatched his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the sec and now\nThe allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi his team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nUh the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today is been heroes some reports claiming that could show these murder was recorded but to date and audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because show he was killed by anyone that can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing are reporting and which in fact they will admit to mall 'cause show he this was the Washington Post columnist now there's a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul right here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analysts former U.S treasury attached shape to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nAh she along with dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent author as well as the now the best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking hasn't been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\n... [noise] yeah yes and I lived there for ... fountain pen in Iraq\nI tend to pay to something like this breaking and the reason I get it because when the president that this morning that he's sending secretary compared to Saudi Arabia that the secretary of state when it is these people in the world certainly in the government has canceled author plans to find halfway around the world\nUm I I Do is incredibly theory that uh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were purchased you believed and we're still going to have to [laughter] if if the records out there it's like what comes out\nOr if the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to there are there any claim of senior leadership is not involved but that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nHow was that there is no until now because how would they not know until now uh when it happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat 'cause they have to question and I think the big takeaway that I have from district court we'll see what happened the secretary on paying people to read out the county not only need to come clean on their front and satisfy President Trump the secretary I'm Pam\nTo come clean on this and satisfy President Trump the secretary um pail you know they have an audience and the and the Congress and the Senate that they're often accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed that President there's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually\nBeen very locally um I'm supportive of the relationship I agree with senator call for a number of reasons that I could go and kill\nWhy I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to the massive\nA movement away from their big finance or I'm just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin says to me that we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports and they were threatening stake here\nYeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil up in fact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S dam bond you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the minute how does somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] but yeah that that's highly unlikely sure there are really two aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a constantly I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that\nYou know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudi there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white situation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis starting to improve\nWe need them were on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I think Trump get one more thing I\nI think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were this had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah yeah and just to say that this thing that not only the threats that worries me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they live with the president on that you know the president came out and said that the king\nAnd then some on the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale and must lead on an elevator it looks like they have like the president I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be down there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and say oh we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nAnd well okay you're going to happen I mean the the women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera and and being told how to dress a being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera I'm ... I'm sure you had to cover up if you left\nIf you went out in public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under the sharia there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you bring in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWasn't modernization and Saturday we felt when then being able to drive we saw each other but they're out there at the government that I had to cut the ... I thought you were sort of high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major U.S team and stuff all\nThe people who dress observant lane and it's such a great clean and that people aren't talking about what you just said is that it has\nBeen an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to win the strike for many years and and this and this new\nRules or oppressed relates to Judaism and Christianity and lesbians or either slogged or killed is not true\nAbsolutely him and but that's for me what's so unfortunate about this incident and why I Hope it gets very quickly is that we will actually singing modernization static", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Florence", "day": "15"}
