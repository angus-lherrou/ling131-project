voters as to whether or not they hear that the people that were supposed to cooperate professional Ford story whether or not they do or not which seems it seems like a a fairly\nSimple task for the FBI would you you would talk to these poor people and if they offered anyone else that they can get in touch with you know I've read James Comey's piece today and I'm like or last night that uh there's something really off\nWith James called me now I Love the FBI I think the world or the FBI I have friends in the FBI and family and the FBI family all over law enforcement\nAnd he was up they FBI back in the middle of it when we were handed that Hillary Clinton email investigation the director said to me you know you're totally screwed right well maybe you shouldn't have written the exoneration before the investigation maybe you know if he understood what the Espionage Act said maybe if he\nIf he understood what obstruction of justice was he wouldn't have taken lightly thirty three thousand deleted emails and bleach bed and breaking up\nDevices with cameras and so on and so forth and he goes oh those were the good old days then he goes on to trash the president on every front believing every left wing narrative about\nWhat the ... about what ... what is that about Trump and he goes on to the FBI agents are experts at interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world the follow up with additional interviews was limited in some way by the Trump Administration\nAlthough the Democrats that said they wanted limited scope they wanted a one week timetable delight that was it they will come from people with testimony and other accounts testing them pushing them in a professional way agents have a much better than nonsense detector the part is is because they aren't starting with the conclusion you mean like he did\nAnd then he actually said that you know and then there are people that won't talk and he said well that speaks volumes refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nWhy would anybody after Michael Flynn\nHere this is why why Hannity always talk about every two and four years racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamic phobic a massage in a steak and dirty air water and by the way Obama one set of Republicans their plan is a dirty dirty water you know and of course we're going to throw granny over the cliff and kill children\nThat's the way Republicans are portrayed now it's their playbook put their playbook is slander their playbook is full\nOf lies you know Republicans\nUnder their playbook is full of lives you know Republicans if you go for for a predominantly black audience is they don't even want to count you in the census [noise]\nThat I don't want to play ... they don't even want to tell you in the census that's why for Republicans if you like them in Missouri crosses that going to burn that's why\nYou know we have all this identity politics look at is America better off today than it was two years ago when you the American people elected Trump\nBy every measure yes\nAnd look at the trade deal that no one's going to spend any time talking about today\nAre at all which oh the president who's going to start trade wars where the rest of the world actually got a better deal for American manufacturers you know those jobs that are never coming back that we now have a thirty year high of those jobs coming back\nCNBC Trump North American trade deal is a new dawn for the U.S auto industry\nThis is great for American farmers is great for American manufacturers it's great for our auto industry\nYou know a lot of my conservative friends they don't say the same thing I don't like his position on trade and I'm telling you I said to them all\nYou don't know I'm like I Do everything in Donald Trump's life as a negotiation\nIf you don't say to Canada and Mexico that you're pulling out if you don't take a strong stand to make them believe it\nYou know they walked prime minister Trudeau to the final our last night grabbing concessions so that America got much better deal than we had with NAFTA\nAnd the St nobody thought it would happen with the new president of Mexico and nobody thought that we can get NATO to step up and pay more considering we pay over Seventy cents of every dollar for defending NATO or the NATO alliance and nobody thought that our Western European allies that we're talking and complaining and having an hauling that\nDonald Trump ones better trade deals with our partners nobody thought that could happen\nYou don't say you're going to start at the start of a trade war if you don't say it and act like you mean you're not going to get concessions and the fact is no American president prior to him even dared broach the subject\nAnd meanwhile we see manufacturing jobs leaving states like Michigan Ohio Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nAnd for all the talk and hatred of Donald Trump style the fact that he breaks a lot of dishes to get things done and he says a lot of things to negotiate\nAre we better off than we weren't two years ago are Hispanic Americans better off African Americans women in the workforce better off youth unemployment fourteen states unemployment low unemployment records his own records\nConsumer confidence Wall Street fight every objective discernible measure would doing better\nAnd result shouldn't matter but in thirty six days Democrats are hoping that they've created enough smoke enough mirrors what did they do in eight years when Obama was president their policies failed on a spectacular level and the time I get back into it\nLet me tell you it was never going to be limited in scope this investigation ever it was never going to be you know just a week or so no that's not what they want and when the FBI comes back and all they do is real from what\nUnder penalty of of a felony the four people and the professor Ford case it said either they don't remember or it didn't happen like the case of the one I witnessed she said was in the room when the alleged incident happened\nThey're not going to be happy and they're going to try and stretch out even further and ask for more investigations they're going to find one little nugget that says because the FBI doesn't get recommendations\nThe ... the FBI is is not going to give don't just going to give okay this is what they said\nBecause they don't have any authority in this particular case\nYou know and now we've got to look into all three claims even the ... you\nKnow you wouldn't believe thirty six years ago routinely on weekends that boys were drug in girls and and then lining up in the halls waiting to\nYou know raped gang rape these young women because that's what the woman said and that's what they want to investigate now\nUm it is seemingly having\nAn impact according to the Remington research group forty eight percent in Missouri likely voters planning to vote for the Republican candidate Josh Hawley\nForty six percent said they plan to vote for McCaskill but then the question of McCaskill's opposition the Kavanaugh whether it's impacting their vote forty nine percent said it made them less likely to vote for McCaskill\nI think Democrats are going to be watching those kind of numbers very closely look their hope is is they they hope they've created enough smoke and fire over Russia still no evidence whatsoever\nThey hope that they create enough smoke and fire here that they can make this all about election day and that you'll forget how awful it was under Obama\nAnd that you won't get up and he voted for Trump most people don't go out and midterms mid term elections are about those people that show up motivating your base to get out there\nIf you want Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer as your majority leader you'll get the government you deserve if you if you want to tune in on election night in thirty six days\nFive weeks from tomorrow and hear Nancy Pelosi the speaker and Chuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader\nIf by the way Mitch McConnell's railing about\nFord was not told of the chairman's offers that's interesting finding that keep them from her that was an interesting side bar there is I Know that Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham on to investigate Dianne Feinstein now why did she holds us for six weeks would have plenty of time by the way it was six extra weeks to investigate why\nDid they hold it because they wanted to create this crisis at this time but\nNo there's a lot at stake in in this upcoming election now we did have um the case\nWhat what is the woman's name Rachel Mitchell was the one that was asking questions for the Republicans in the Senate\nA professor Ford and she did a very strong analysis of the case you said in the legal context here is my bottom line\nAnd he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that she said Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either a few did her allegations or failed to corroborate up\nFor the reasons discuss below I Do not think of reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient dissatisfied a preponderance of evidence standard even\nAnd you know I that's a pretty powerful statement\nNow we have what else do we have here so we got some other blue state numbers that are really interesting to watch um there's a lot of reasons why in New Jersey this was surprising to me Democratic Sen Robert Menendez is having a tough time getting re elected this is not a state anybody\nThis is having a tough time getting re elected this is not a state anybody's been paying a lot of attention to\n'em it didn't help him this weekend when a used professor Ford's allegations to bash Brett Kavanaugh and he tweeted out Sunday or Saturday the details of professor Ford's testimony or heart wrenching to hear I Hope every single senator not only watches but listens\nAnd two days later the political had a headline shock poll shows a dead heat in Menendez Senate race in New Jersey\nAnd by the way you know think Christie Todd Whitman and um what's the what's the name of the past governor a Christie Christie himself Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman Christie a lot of Christie's in New Jersey\nBut anyway it was forty five forty three within the margin of error in New Jersey\nGrassley is urging the Justice Department announced prosecute in the case of ah the man who falsely accused Brett Kavanaugh raping an acquaintance

Democrats get control of the house and he wants lawmakers to investigate any credible allegations\nYou want to give him the power want to give Maxine Waters that power\nLindsey Graham is now vowed to conduct a full scale investigation into Dianne Feinstein which I think is the right thing to do why would she said on this why didn't she tell law enforcement why did she sit next to Kevin why would

think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however what ever the senators want\nIs okay with me they're going to be making a decision what ever they want is okay with me for Fifteen Years

guy\nWhen he was the attorney general's Connecticut the line I don't mean a little bit and then when he got out he actually dropped out of the race that he won anyway because Democrats are always went

because he had beer I think the judge has been a\nPretty amazing about describing his situation with alcohol and with beer\nAnd I think people need to understand this election\nIs a choice about which

turn out to be a historic week one way or the other um Mr Speaker thirty six days is election day\nAnd I will tell you there's something I never\nEver in a lotta years now witness the anger and the level of anger that exist on behalf of the Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these\nTactics against Brett Kavanaugh um is that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people they're not wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there are sprinkler steps here one is to communicate as you just did that this is about America\nThis is the most important midterm election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in order we keep going forward or we return to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between results and resistance\nAnd whether people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that were to move and the right direction or go back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama\nAnd then third I think the Republicans should have and I hope by next week we'll have a set of very positive think of it as a pledge of if if we were elected here over the next steps are all going to take care of the next good things are going to happen and I think that there are enough things working\nBetween the administration and the house and Senate Republicans that we can put together a very good positive campaign soldiers are three part campaign which America do you want results versus resistance and a commitment to an even better next two years\nI missed is bigger things for being with us we appreciate your time as always eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program\nA when we come back my colleague my friend from the Fox news channel Tucker Carlson we'll check in with us we'll get his take on the news of the day and much more straight ahead as we continue from the swamp the sewer feces straight ahead [noise]\nThis is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nBonded Sanchez an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be racist watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist unit was going to happen because it had to happen\nA lot of there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said uh you know elect Republicans black cross cross is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr by remaining well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this\nBrett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations\nAnd it doesn't matter like if Michael ... making the claim that thirty six years ago that there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ing girls and then waiting in line to gang in trail raped them\nAnd that this was happening with a regular occurrence but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official up parents that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to why I went to school at one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWorth ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive ... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either in she on the hand for them was raped herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven year okay I don't have time for that accent or as a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address and to what you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time it's for football\nAnd you have like Senator from Arizona's like I don't really need to give us a hearing really if there are laws civil claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in the space Twenty years radical clearance could allow him the codes could nuclear arsenal\n... ...\nAnd yet we needed not there on the basis of claims have doses to actually shut all men not attacking him for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happened to him for people she says repressing all for say it didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions I mean\nIt's a joke at is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it\nWell this is the way I either some said they had no recollection ever of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor Ford is saying about I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor of foreign identified one person and that was mark judge and mark judge having been in the room when this alleged assault took place and he has said over and over again that's not true now they made statements under\nPenalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they will be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed than they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to end it into that aspect in but so\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGot to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake\nAnd where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it's Lindsey Graham seems the only person willing to tell the truth but where the rats were the other night in Republican senators out there on television and make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters\nAnd on this one thing they can't just tell the truth why is that for art and what are they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nDo you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at them as NBC I don't know how that worked out for you but uh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and as Paul conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously I was a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is\nTalk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it's straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions are there\nBoos sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews we have people give opinion um we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claimed to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lotta news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there on my job is to buy new things to fleshed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life to what my family that I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts\nFor white every night and I see our drop water every Ricardo ... to really confusing Congress I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen\nWhy did Trump got elected where you can get a black to grow up what actually happened and what actually happened was the people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learned any and so voters got mad at punish them are good for them to why we're so that's I that's what I think my job is to explain what ... me and I think it'd be disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right\nNow I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it\nI don't it like for example there'll be days on this radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence why don't you\nKnow they're you know what I mean there are less than nine talk or there was a handful of us Tucker there's not that many and by the way there's a orchestrated effort in millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website ... dot com\nThe ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution
