tomorrow town hall interview with Ted Cruz Rick Perry\nEleven o'clock details sanity dot com on the other side we will continue bill O'Reilly's next [noise]\nNo because they can't when they can't they can't win on the electoral basis we saw that with Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton that was the last straw\nFor the George Soros is in the far left the media matters all of these people once they went down in the presidential election that all of them thought they were going to win because they have the media in their pocket and still do\nThen they said you know what we got to abandon um the free market place we act and now going assassinate people and this is very similar to what happened in Germany on bringing him back to the end by the way of\nSaying that you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that they that that people today are like not the killing people what you're saying is that there are similar lying propaganda Mitt nation demonization very different from saying that they're a death camps\nYeah I mean there's just look that can't happen in America thank God because our structure\nIs still in place to prevent anything like that happening\nBut I'll tell you what antifa no different than the essay George Soros behind the scenes with tens of millions of dollars alright funneling into agencies that are bent on destroying human beings and we talked about this last time I was on a program what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nEvery American should pay attention to that because of that guy can go down on uncorroborated are uncorroborated than anybody in this country Ken and as you rightly pointed out to try to with Trump on the Russian collusion\nThat's collapsing all over the place the fusion GPS guy put out a dot CA taking the Fifth Amendment now won't testify what does that tell you\nOkay so you know we're living in a dangerous time but\nLet me turn it into this in your I'm agreeing with you that that what really got exposed to me that scares me\nA lot and there's two things one is we ever do justice system we don't have equal justice or equal application of our laws needs to be looking at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever\nBut the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh abandon\nAll principle constitutional law and the and and literally core values that have served do so well which are due process\nThe presumption of innocence the Republican for the first time in their life that something right they handled it with the seriousness of the topic deserves they were thorough they did it right and at the end of the day there was no corroboration to the allegations being made and now we see people like what\nEric Holder kick them we can't be civil Hillary Clinton getting their face Cory Booker or Maxine Waters you see these cabinet people you get a crowd\nAnd you follow them into the grocery stores department stores gas stations and you tell them we don't want them nowhere anymore that's what she sent nowhere\nElse for you it's amusing that you ran down the list and uh we we could add ten more and then Trump goes to Montana and makes a joke a joke\nAbout the Republican candidate for Senate they're um slam dunk ... a reporter [laughter] you know and it was obviously set in jest and no press goes lie all crazy yet all the things that you pointed out are somehow over law\nAnd not overlooked and they they\nWell they do not fairs yeah yeah well because now they're in concert there the the American media use in concert with the Democratic party and that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic where the the eighty percent of the media now is promoting\nA political party so it's going to be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one I don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know a dozen no I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty six day not I said it's absolutely possible that Donald Trump is going to win then ... then the\nThe five days of on the factor five days before he was going to win because people didn't like Hillary Clinton\nAnd you're there even gonna stay home or vote against her and not to exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't say it on your TV and radio show but what\nYou're going to you saying then they're going to attribute it to me and then I got an ally ... and let's all Riley say the stuff he won't good\nThat you have no idea what I'm going to talk about it because nobody ever does and nobody tells\nYou I don't even think you or me either no what we're going to save a court before comes flying out of our mouths now\nBut what would you do every day I mean you're you're putting in four hours a day doing commentary and then you have to go home but you have to have unbelievable security surrounding you that should never happen in a free society\nNever been out of this bill or not the only one oh I'm not talking about it right you know I mean it was something that would have done the companies are going on right\nOn and the conservative commentators are all in danger and and this is you know to me I'm I'm saying to myself I just got to be exposed number one and it's got to stop number two and you can't have people telling a\nAnd it's got to stop number two and you can't have people telling a emotionally disturbed individuals hey surround them when they're in a restaurant\nI mean that should be watching more should be investigated by the ethics committee of the house just for saying that\nBill we're seeing now and two major cities many riots

can see it on the horizon I ... I don't want it to happen by the way and I'll say that any conservative keep your hands in your pocket and just because you disagree with somebody be respectful\nWere let don't tell you that don't do it don't go down at a level well we've already had the shooting at the softball field there right which was under covered by the national press you know Steve Scully everybody\nA who watches Fox News knows the story but if you just watch MSNBC you wouldn't know ski Steve ... that happened to him\nI'm so you're right and that's what I'm Talking to you about today and I'm trying to I Want to hang\nOn one of their um because I Want to talk a little bit about your book that's called killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals in history that's on his website Bill O'Reilly dot com Hannity dot com Amazon dot com bookstores everywhere a first I Do Michael and do by the way it's going to join us than in the next hour he's traveling the country to help\nHouse Republican candidates and how US Senate Republican candidates\nBut I sleep better than ever because neither drug or alcohol induced it's the greatest pillow ever made my pillow it helps me fall asleep pastor I stay asleep longer now Mike is taking it to the whole next level\nNow if you love my pillow 'cause it's support your neck and it gives you a great night sleep where do you try is new product called my\nPillow mattress copper old as you just put it takes ... seconds you put on top of your mattress and it's like you're sleeping on a cloud it's my pillow for the entire body\nHas three layers my pillow phone for support and has transitional form to help relieve pressure points ultra saw pat and the temperature regulating cover on top of that and it comes of course with a ten year warranty is washable dry Beau\nIt's made in the usa he's got over sixteen hundred employees now it's backed by Mike sixty they unconditional money back guarantee it's the greatest thing I've ever had\nI sleep on a cloud I sleep better than ever it works and right now you'll say thirty percent when you use the promo code Hannity when you go to my pillow dot com or you can call eight hundred nine one nine six zero nine zero\nAnd it'd be call right now on top of the thirty percent reduction you'll get to standard my pillows absolutely free my pillow dot com eight hundred nine one nine six zero nine zero promo code Hannity will continue [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Florence", "day": "19"}
