Chinese Chinese re militarization\nOf the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it from second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that's over thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes\nThat even exist read his ... speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing so that what he\nSaid at the un is\nAbsolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here\nEven exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had\nThe probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being a stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and good luck everything's riding on this\nI don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that\nHistory would would win out because the party that wins the White House usually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times only really picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack and die on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here\nAnd that is what literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies and we better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist stronger national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the they will cost you a Cortez is we have the Maxine Waters and control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who use that philosophy in the past about philosophy drives\nTo the labor camps drives to the ... and Dr death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces his figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in the\nSo my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China\nBut the second part is much more important is is the one who hitting on it do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and rusty rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allow the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual rule to win in addition to the the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero adjusted pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nThe story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's Whittaker Chambers\nMost kids have no idea who would have ... says this is a man who was cabinet owed before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing was a man cool would it could chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets\nWho went on record saying hey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know whether the communist off in the governments including ... his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nBut you choose ... of everything cheating on his wife big Jews Tim ... of the best of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what does he do you have the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice ... the social and his his his his a scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the Gen rye or you know they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick break we'll come back more with Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight as new book defeating
