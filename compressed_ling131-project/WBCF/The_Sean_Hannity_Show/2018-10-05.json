tomorrow I start my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\n[noise] well uh you know I'm I'm In a political\nSystem this deteriorating I think what you saw today somebody step forward to maybe say that\nThe biggest winner of this speech has the judiciary because here's a wholesale attack on the independence of the judiciary one at all costs what you saw the day was a person embracing the rule of law not the rule of the mob what you saw today was a woman\nNot being intimidated what you saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being said a strong woman which you saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country and I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward\nBut this is as close to McCarthyism as I Hope it never witness in my life\nAnd if anybody turned it around and it was senator Collins\nChina you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came\nWhen they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh I don't think any of us will forget anytime soon the things that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that\nRemember the accusation by Julie sweating it was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that that judge Kavanaugh and others\nWere routinely drug in girls lining up in halls gang raping\nNumb and it happens frequently and I know that some people brought up the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night how was one supposed to act if you're innocent to the\nCharge of drugging teenage girls and participating in gang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but I Would think if you're innocent it is one of deep anger\nAnd and the frustration Eighteen days ago nobody thought any of those the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well yeah I think I think the most Americans saw a man who was fighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this\nWent through a logical explanation based on a calendar that very few people in the world Keith except him and his dad and just a wanted everybody to know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life\nI'm not evil and I think he reacted consistently been innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here when the sweat Nick allegation came out it\nWas breaking news allegation number three at a very new and evil level right so I thought I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party\nOr where people were drugged and raped and go to too much less than that made no sense ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah\nSusan is going to be this way for a while to come\nRead it here's my take on it and being in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge this doesn't have the ring of truth\nShe said you know that makes sense followed anybody keep going back and putting themselves in that situation and the friends not tell anybody and you've got to remember is ... and she worked through the process you took teach allegation on its own\nShe went to all the major decisions that judge Kavanaugh\nAnd spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a ... every I think they should be in every civics class in the country every high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins\nExplanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election and thirty two days to me senator a look at your when Senator or I I Know how close you are to Senator McCain right and who recently\nPassed away and I always admired him for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for\nPresident in oh wait over bronco mama it was the right decision then and I stand by the day I had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated and I don't remember who said that how these people on radio and TV and you know I understood\nSenator McCain that's you know he kind of had that side of him and I knew it\nReally well um but he also talked in that speech to about
