this is about is Donald Trump is a historic president and the region and he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so what's going to happen is\nThe presidential race is going to start right after the election November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big deal to people who are going to be on the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nIt's all about feeding Donald Trump so this race November six is not just about control the Congress\nIt's really about the what the\nDemocrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three million Trump voters that are out there need to get motivated to vote on November section fat they should go to your website for Hannity dot com and see the top thirty most important races in the house and go and click through and click\nThrough to donate to the Republicans to match whatever the Democrats are doing to try to take control because yes race November ... really about the next presidential race\nAll right thank you Doug Jones thank you John McLaughlin eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\nAnd you see the stark difference between the southern tier which is why so many jobs this is where IBM was actually founded now we've lost a thanks for the policies of the Democrats in poverty that have just strangled our economy we're actually seeing an uptick I'm a small business owner and this district our family business which started in Nineteen forty six\nAnd I've been around to just to see I've traveled to fifty or Seventy five businesses I have yet to meet one that has a priest us for tax reform and they're saying we're actually increased tax cuts are were reinvest thing\nEvery one of them is giving a race to their employees or opponents or both we're finally seeing a glimmer of hope we roll back on necessary regulation\nOr we can really open up the ... the southern chair to responsible gas drilling a Governor Cuomo votes will not let it happen my opponent repeatedly thoughts against that and this is how scary my opponent is getting a debate last night he ever voted four times\nFor government takeover\nOf our health care which is single payer which would cost the taxpayers of New York this was bragged about by the socialist leaning guy who's just sponsored the bill would only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety two billion in New taxes on an annual basis\nIt would be cool [laughter] that's it led to believe what Ninety two billion when we're already take half your money anyway a incredibly\nOr any at all what\nThis is a solution not voted four times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate here this is a radical you this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is a ... support the president he's not going to support the president\nHe's going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment caucus is going to chime right in with all these Democrats you never shown that he has a fact on\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job to get on the assembly now he's hand picked by Chuck Schumer who brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny now they're kind of come to the district to help him get elected but you know who came to our district\nTrump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also had his son Eric I'm there and his daughter a bunk up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why they are having you on those and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican\nAnd you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats and the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money has been talking to my colleagues all across the country amount of money they're jumping introduced racist attracted to see the voters Israeli it's outrageous man my opponent star outspending may I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York\nUh when I served in the assembly on still you know one of the top conservatives but we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to witness elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we gotta support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains\nEven upstate New York where we haven't really tough economy I mean we are actually helping or small business community or small business humidity\nIs about Ninety eight percent of my my the businesses in my region and they create most of the chops that's his name health is alive by Nancy Pelosi that somehow the wealthiest said the only ones benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the recent Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts\nBecause his wealthy donors wanna leave New York because they're not getting the lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight this is this is a tough battle because the\nDemocrats have the money to deceive voters and fool them into thinking that this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get the vote out its most important we can beat the wall with money but we need a Republican voters to understanding each ticket out it's really really port\nAlright uh Claudia Tenney are running in New York and unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com ... the main\nYou know ground zero seats that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so called ... and we wish you the best things for being with us and hopefully we'll my son and your back to Congress and eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves if we don't have many good New York politicians at all\nBy the way just going back to direct or re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real and that in fact they've been able to identify at least some forensic evidence including fingerprints\nWhich which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today a little more about that as the day unfolds here or let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny is in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you a lot and I have not been any political sense whatsoever but these mid terms are I'm only be important\nTo get out and vote 'em out of this and you hit on it every day I listen to it and not watch it or not but I\nWas I Hope everyone feels the same way you do is four hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for ...\nThere's four hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home that's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home a half a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve\nI've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shocked the world in the media\nYou know I see three scenarios that could unfold bad to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win\nIf people identify the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will\nPick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won I especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen\nAnd you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff a Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters\nWant to do to the country and we're not going to go away we're not going to cry when not going to be and cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want to enlist investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth\nAnd then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait until I'm telling you what's gonna happen we know they only want Obamacare we know they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nWe know they want their crumbs back we know they want higher taxes we know they you know they don't they don't really ... they're all things hating Trump all the time\nNot exactly in the best interest of the country to keep focused on that for two years but we'll do our best\nIn or we can win at all or we can lose it all listen all of us here on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity and you don't pay to be a member but it has everything you need everything I Need to look feels spell my best your best\nAnd when I Love even more is the fact you know what I I I hate going to stores I really do especially and
