facts getting in the way all the Republican Party rejects anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders I never get in a rural what Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about his anti Semitism\nAnd his racism the shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently\nIt you know as Ron ... rightfully said\nUh this weekend on Fox News that you know these very ill and anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that has taken place and this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years we've read it we've studied it they've gone through it all and we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel or president said we will see their destruction which is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism\nIn oh Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy of the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump but as the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nWe haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever\nAnd what an act of courage it was apparently but there's other presidents have promised that never did it\nAnd making Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel and they were going to get to all of that that Fox News similarly under attack I've got all the latest numbers on the election\nUm I'm also going to tell you if right now I Would say the Republicans at eight days my prediction is today I'll give you one every day there's any updates they pick up seats in the Senate but I think we're down in the house by five all explain why\nBy threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos\nCurbelo that story came out this week yet he's been threatened\nWas a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn and he had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half\nEarn and he had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half a dozen angry liberal protestors they had to be removed\n\nAnd you'd think of the language or we can't be civil with Republicans and kick them and\nAll the other comments that have been made and then the other silence when it happens to a conservative\nReally shouldn't be something that's political\nAnd calling somebody fake news I mean it is so disgusting overt CNN\nSomebody sent me a transcript focus was on news busters of home the dumped the oh I understand that CNN doesn't like fake news and they don't like being called fake news but they are fake news and not a news organization anymore they have gone fulltime destroyed Trump every second of every minute pretty much of every day\nThat's what they do so they have this panel I guess that they put together\nAnd they're talking about what happened in the synagogue shooting and\nHave to look closely at the poison being spread sometimes on television sometimes out of the mouths of political leaders and often times on ugly dark corners of social media\nAs can be pretty ugly\nAnd it goes on the first panelist as Bill Kristol or never Trump or he attacks Fox News'\nMike hello what we can have conservatives in my I support mainstream conservatism bill\nI don't know what happened to you I support original is on the Supreme Court I support lower taxes less government burdensome regulation I support energy independence I support legal immigration I support border security\nI support peace through strength and a tough national security posture with a strong military to defend the values that we all believe it\nAnd I support you know\nA free press even to be wrong even criticize the media for being wrong that Washington Post columnist comes out some woman I've never heard of Margaret Sullivan\nYou know her praising or analysis in the Democratic threats et cetera et cetera reads like a list of Sean Hannity's free broad ... broadcast crib notes\nAnd then he was asked point blank if she blame people on the right like Kennedy for the violence\nI look Margaret you write about this this week uh with regards to the bomb attacks are these suspicious packages he said you know looking all his target city this read like a list of Sean Hannity is pre broadcast ... notes that was the way you put in your Washington Post Tom I getting are you blaming the hands of the world\nI think they have a share of I'm sort of the wrapping up of hatred um without regard for a while it's a fact my feet without much regard for the truth I mean the way things are being patch on Fox and and\nA pro Trump right wing media is dangerous and it's destructive so I think we need to call it what it is\nNow ... Lewis was on from the Daily Beast of all players and he actually\nWas the only one that made even a little sense he said the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be Hannity's targeted\nSanctions have perverse incentives to gin up their base for elections I think a cable news has incentives to by jet up anger and anxiety and passion for ratings same thing with websites with cliques in tweets\nAh I agree with everything that we've set so far today the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be Sean Hannity who was targeted for a Republican congressman who was targeted\nAnd while I agree with the condemnation of what Fox has done in terms of Jennings off this anger over the caravan I think that this is a much more widespread problem well\nIt is more widespread than I have had far more instances and I'm willing to talk about a real credible threats towards me and my family including the one that I did share last week\nWith white powder purported to be anthrax sent to my office and one of my employees having to spend an entire day in isolation scared out of her mind and it's been worse but\nObviously these people are not listening to what I'm saying\nBecause I have been saying we've got to get what what do I advocate I'm like okay I Want I Want these principles stood up for I fight for the American forgotten men and women I fight for lower taxes\nLess pure bureaucratic regulation energy independence Supreme Court nominees the believe in the constitution\nI Believe we should secure our borders legal immigration these things I I believed in my entire life and career a strong military security for the American people a strong stand against evil in our time\nNot that complicated\nI Know what the democratic agenda is if they win it's gonna be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they said they want their crumbs back we know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the elimination of ice and they think Obamacare works and it doesn't\n\nKnow yet and MSNBC you know literally pressing the Israeli ambassador termer to blame Trump for the synagogue attack that's how sick it's gotten\n\nYou know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political violence no he's not\n\nBut I guess it's an easy blame game\nSo now we've taken the predictable every two four years Republicans were racist and sexist and massaging us than the Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic and they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff and now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true\nAnd it's not any conservative I Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue it was a very ill and anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump but that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing\nThat narrative\nYou know this is you know watch watching the Washington Post alone is unbelievable box deserve their headlights Fox News and the rest of the right wing media can escape responsibility\nOh I've been the biggest supporter of Israel that I Know in the mainstream media have been my entire career friends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades than there during the war and been there at other times reporting\n\nShowing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show the friends who they who Bronx formally Shimon Peres\n\nName names according to the Washington Post Trump's hate analyze our inciting extremist well those extremists in the synagogue hated Trump\nWas at the Washington Post headlines that you got from the G O P defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people\nOn CNN fake news that couldn't identify 'em up for who they are these phony hypocrites Trump blames and you know something\nAre these phony hypocrites Trump blames and you know something when the media live twenty four seven and they get called out that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living in\nNow here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch column\nAnd I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez just barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nMaybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard but possible\nPeople in New Jersey clearly a fed up with an end us\nThen I think it's too close to call in either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why\nFloridians are flirting with Gil almost got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic job as governor and\nIt'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada\nI don't know why Kristin seminar cinema\nWe got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nI don't see how somebody who supported Americans

I'm Sorry to interrupt you\nShine it isn't saying it it is it ... it it is them desperate trying to help the Democratic allies win elections\nI Love which at the the rabbi said rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here we've got and he was not objecting at all to the president's visit which I appreciate and when we start focusing on the blame game which is what we do especially the the let media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happened so you know what really happened is as we discussed an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those are the words that were true unspoken from him he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I Know so many of them they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else it causes rushing away we had a doctor of analysts\nWho went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth these were not acts\nOf a nation divided that's what the ones that the way the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not\nWe're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it just makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he said the bullet holes are too numerous to count\nBut we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been near one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off some branches but the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nSo that Sean is who we are and did as a nation I Know you agree that we are the nation we are not invited\nHim and the ... most of us are not put the blame game ... there are some yes and it's All right well thank you both again a rose our thoughts and prayers to all our friends in Pittsburgh and to the community in the synagogue and the rabbi please send more loving in regards and our prayers um\nEight hundred nine four one shown toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program eight days till election day how do we get out the vote was going to deal with that all the other issues of the day threats against Republicans that the media just outright ignores\nAnd the mob mentality continues will have full chronicling of all of this as we continue eight days till election day the best election coverage available on your radio dial\nAnd everybody tells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but\nI think you're right though because the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor in that state in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in mid term election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen\nHe won by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in mid term election work turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean I talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to as few as twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelicals are pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them\nWe've got emails on about half of them uh we we have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they vote or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us more tax and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the houses\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and Minnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power\nBut then I say that and I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them can tip the balance of power and while you use the polls in somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide\nAnd get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right now we really see the houses on the bubble we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now\nA hundred seats in clay and probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had off off or you know two three four five and he lost by four\nIt's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers and the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking\nAn election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shocked the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally what I read the exit polls the five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and the at that moment reading the exit polls trumpet lost Florida last North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he loves Michigan the last was constantly last at all\nNew id barely won state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls at five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the vote out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI I have to be honest with these Sean I got to give credit where the credit is due first of all\nA to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited\nAnd secondly to the Democrats for during the cabinet nominations trying to ... air and destroy a good man and his family and we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen\nAnd we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood\nWe had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted\nA guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenities at her she sent me an email later and said not only am I not that church she said I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's that kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country\nYou know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of decency and character still alive in this country the answer is a ... yeah it is they send the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is the use of social media I don't think anybody has a more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think uh you know for rock Obama was the first\nSocial media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president and the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer I assure you Trump's has mastered it or not only in his use of\nFor a bomber was the pioneer I assure you Trump says bastard it or not only and his use of social media platform but also the thing is that his campaign ... did in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms Seventy two percent\nOf the voters were seeking to contact her on Twitter or Facebook or another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote\nThey get dropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing their social media count then begin to go elsewhere so\nI agree look anything is possible I ... I don't take things for granted\nI was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening but as I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally\nYou know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic 'em and you can see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate and they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shocked the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision\nWhere Republicans get seats in the Senate but below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half a vote from below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for ...\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination\nYou know you see different polls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president\nWe have a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me he was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThat we're over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on the jumbotron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot quantity of quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nQuick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition might cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security\nThat's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security is layers of protection spread across computers networks programs\nAnd realize not only ON Technology but also making smart choices\nLike keeping software updated in staying informed on cyber safety out consumers also need cyber security to protect their digital lives in today's connected world it just takes one weak link criminals get in a thank goodness there's the all new life lock identity theft protection with the added power of Norton Security that protects\nYou against threats to your identity or devices that you can't see or fix on your own now new life lock with Norton Security\nWell you can get it now like block dot com you need it in this day and age protect your name your reputation your finances\nLife lock dot com one eight hundred life lock promo code Hannity or get an extra ten percent off your first year and for a limited time aide twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with your annual enrollment as life locked dot com one eight hundred life lock\nPromo code Hannity we'll continue\nOur rounded up and you do not want to miss it as they do vinyl our river all all the Sean Hannity show [noise]", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Florence", "day": "29"}
