move and uh when I asked for comment\nAll they said was well project meritocracy posed as a fake volunteer and and you secret video recording equipment to capture uninformed is speculative comments made last weekend by college students and youth organizers\nWell that's not exactly true is that James O'Keefe was the c._e._o. of project ... is with us or some of them were high ranking campaign

anonymously you can actually see this in the coming out of their own mouse they're the ones who are selling it so we are confirming the suspicions what you just said we've confirmed that\nAnd again it's not just one or two or three and half a dozen of these people are inside the campaign office\nThey have confirmed that the people are real and and then of course you have the material with his bread isn't staffer thinks the Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe said quote we don't say this out of these walls says will be a good Democrat and what that means he'll be a good Democrat that means that\nHe's going to vote with the Schumer wing of the party once she gets elected kind of see they don't want that even the Democrats don't want them to a beach Chuck Schumer Democrats so all of this is pretty amazing stuff Sean and uh\nYou know it's just we're confirming what was known for years\nYou know if you think back and you'd think Peter's struck and he talked about smelly Wal Mart Trump voters and you think abiding just what like last month saying that the Trump voters were the ... of society despite\nLosing the court and then the court of public opinion of these forces of intolerance remained determined to undermine them rolled back for progress you all may\nThis time they're not you have an outline in the White House this time they have in a\nSmall percentage of the

religion\nI mean there's such hatred in contempt but voters there's another tape we showed last night James I don't know if you saw the show we did run your tape and ... thank you for sharing it with us but an Arizona democratic senator a Senate candidate name's Kristen cinema\nLiterally caught on tape and twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona crazy and it's even worse than that because we found out\nIts own a crazy and it's even worse than that\nBecause we found out Fox News dot com reported that she was promoting an event at Arizona State university featuring a lawyer is lawyer was convicted of aiding and Islamic terrorist organization in its leader\nAnd the lawyer in question presented represented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the nineties for plotting to blow up the UN and FBI building and more\nWe're going to fight that person to\nYou know just I mean it's unbelievable to me what they're doing is they're just outright lying to people\nBut they have to show on that that's the the whole purpose behind our organization Vera ... exposed the real nature thing the reality\nAnd the motivations behind these people and and they have to lie and the red state it's not it's a democratic red state Democrats have to lie in order to get elected and when they get into the Senate\nVote one way yes or no but they have to mislead and misinform the voters and and again and so if people think that it requires all this espionage it doesn't you walk into the office just ask them questions staffers all tell you the same\nSo we don't actually believe this and if there's one thing voters won't tolerate shot is one thing left left or right thing because it's just so self evident you can't lie to people you can't lie about what your intentions are you have to be honest\nAnd they cannot get elected they will not if\nThey still no you're right if they if they state what they really believe they'll never get elected so what area do it's like uh they just it's an
