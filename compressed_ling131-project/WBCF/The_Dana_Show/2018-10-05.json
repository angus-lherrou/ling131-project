suggests came along the line for two weeks without the backing of the U.S military spending that is why the guns largest economy blind spot that cash next year [noise]\nOil traders began the weak chewing over the news that President Trump pet spoken on the phone to Saudi king but I've been on these on Saturday\nThat came just days after the U.S leaders slander beg for ripping off the world we got more with Middle East energy reporter and through the ... and John Iraq on the managing director for Middle East and Africa for noisy burger bourbon\nWe know that they spoke they talked about the market they talked about in the Saudis effectively keeping enough supply and the market to make sure that that demand is met the real concern or coming up is Iran\nSanctions will be put on Iran energy sanctions that are supposed to cut its oil purchases oil exports rather to zero in November So that's a real concern for the oil market whether there's going to be a big shortage there\nAnd from his really wanting to get the Saudis are on his side to make sure that the market and the big a target for Trump once those run sections are in place is a mid term elections in the United states he wants to make sure that\nGasoline prices in the United states don't go crazy and don't make a\nVoter is upset with what's basically his signature move you know he wanted to get rid of that Iran deal he's done it he doesn't want to pay the brother was ...\nThat we mentioned in our story the WikiLeaks as Saudi Arabia is the Federal Reserve of oil but of course Missouri\nThe UAE oil minister warns you know you don't want to overuse or these what is the line that he is a you don't want to use these Saudi Arabia's capacity it has a limited for is the debate is high much can they decide they have\nTo do it's a good comparison you make from the we can look circus Trump has gone after the Federal Reserve and OPEC\nUh from both on the same way can facts twice for OPEC he he criticized them before they went into a committee meeting to talk about the market uh that was a week ago we criticize them there was no real promise of more supply coming into the market\nAnd then he ... he set that up a level criticizing the OPEC in the EU and now a Saudi spare capacity is it is fine I have never produced over eleven million barrels a day\nI'm there for low ten point five they said you know the call and Saudi oil field a smidgen above ... can be ten foot six can be ten point nine but we'll make it this is the words of the Saudi oil minister of course if you start to go much higher than that then the market gets nervous again about their the Saudis have enough and then prices go up\nOkay as they got ... and they just out of the middle east energy reporter on the market on gas\nDiscuss things oil as he is ... ... managing director for the middle east and Africa and you ... have you with us this morning as we take what Anthony is just to do I I I sort of defined as being we are one step away from\nA big accident to take us to a hundred dollars to put in ... and the detainee library we are on a tour quarter in a row they'll always when you speak on oil in ten years how close to the markets supply accidents always\nSo one of the things that we've talked about before\nUm is one of its most senior and small just ... for the amount of just sort of described it to me is like\nTen dollars a movement in oil is driven by demand and supply twenty drone ... of or movement on ... driven by speculation the rest is politics so are we in politics territory so are we really going to get to that a hundred and really quickly that's going to be a as as I said that's just going to be driven by\nHow people feel around the tightness from the Iran it doesn't necessarily reflect demand and supply from an economic perspective a fundamental respect\nBut the Rio and we put this together on a graphic is well the buffer is very very ... who has a whole looking here at the lowest level then\nSince two thousand and eight when oil prices zoom two hundred and fifty dollars a barrel that's before the impact of disruption owner and while using a hundred dollars a barrel do the cars from where you're sitting one is on the\nCarts what we think this ranges and we think there's ranges very reasonable we think this range is good but at the same time um we don't know where a girl said direction only a hundred is not good at starts making things in the global economy feel a bit awkward in tight\nBut let's not forget that that that this time round the u._s. isn't that exposed to so from a mathematics perspective they actually do okay if it goes up as well but the reality is from the gasoline pump they don't want that prize to be that high but the reality is from an economic perspective you in the U.S as well as a hundred dollars a barrel because then that exposure to\nRun the numbers and in terms of war as Trump voters are ...\nAnd gasoline prices initially correlate imitate an air incredibly tightly correlated from the ... it'll be on the market to demean emphasis I suppose that the D.C of course I'm referring to Bahrain and used the way that we have this morning we have a more complex and\nIn terms of what the D.C will do for the rent is is the prime loans and deposit it seemed to be\n... at that time did a\nOffering are we getting to the point there were five years and said team billion dollars\nIs enough I think what the market wants to see if they want to see reform they want to see ... taking a step out of that cozy comfortable place\nOf of of really having to do nothing [laughter] so if you're going to look at foreign debt market yeah they take comfort in the fact that is so sort of different forms of bailout bonds that are that supported

steps and he's out you just can't keep giving them to stop hiding in a corner in the classroom come to the front of the cloth and and and and start doing what you're being told and so I think all these things the markets but I think fundamentally we want to say by hiring started to live\nWell during the week President Trump lashed ice had Saudi Arabia during a rally in Mississippi\nJak Saudi Arabia would you say\nI Love getting some embrace it would protect\nYou might not be there for two weeks without us you have to pay for your military\nMeanwhile branch cringe crime ... above eighty

definitely both I mean it's difficult to to split the impact of both of these apart but they are both playing a pretty rural cars on the one hand what's happening with their own [noise] um I Would say that there's a great deal of uncertainty from the market as to how much or how quickly Ron structures on the phone off and I ... uh the ...\nOn the market as to how much or how quickly runs projects on the phone off and I ... uh the market is is pressing a much more hawkish outcome that might otherwise be the case\nUm but at the same time there is certainly politics here an object me this is playing out onto her all simply because it is quite clear that production from a package down here on you\nAnd so there is a feeling I think it's probably will kitty from a president from there's a feeling that could be done to uh increase supply but there's definitely going to be some elements of a domestic politics at play here we can only speculate given that there hasn't been an official announcement\nBut often having spent the last many years and great expense and bring down that access to a person and ending the process of infantry tribulation I think uh the producers and the juicy expletives in particular\nWill be very cautious about how quickly they respond to market prices they don't want to put too much on the marketing push the market back to a situation where it's a separate once again\nYeah so just to to ... to add some more me too that are the commodity price functional the Bloomberg suggests that we're not really looking beyond the eighty four dollars a barrel by the end of the year in terms of the median estimates and going into Twain Nineteen and I should go lower from ... zone or you are you\nWhen you share that view or are you more bullish like the rest of the market seems at this very moment oh\nNo no we share that view I mean we all are told her own little reflected on TALK of price or about Seventy eighty and I'm going in the next year we are a bit better because the process of infantry drawdown has ended and then it's like we're looking for more dust accumulation aren't you going to twenty Nineteen\nUm we don't think the current level can be sustained long term but as we have seen in the short term that momentum ... and it can exceed by quite a monitoring what what the fundamentals would dictate\nI'm given that from a technical angle there's news or the next kid resistance level is older but by eight to nine so between here and eight to nine from a technical perspective is nothing really stopping um that that that little pressed climb\nI Want to check back to emerging markets 'cause we had the graphic matters point to earlier on which showed that the the reality of the pricing and and local currency terms Egypt perhaps no and focus again we understand that a little bit savings that they've been able to make up or natural gas with the higher oil prices are now going away Egyptians town looks like it's coming under pressure\nDefinitely uh it must be coming under pressure because we're seeing that across the emerging market space\nBe successful entrepreneur the expertise of the best in those first entrepreneur is

all the pictures or any you know when the whole economy in my room was marginally on the back or jumping in orders more with the fact that a lot of the more management in the middle east\nThe first thing is we should look at the numbers not just on a monthly basis but an aggregate and uh in terms of the trend and the trends pull the ... ... pm I was a little bit disappointing but overall the last three or four months we've seen a gradual recovery and when you put that together with some of the other\nOf three or four months we've seen a gradual recovery and when you put that together with some of the other day too that we're starting to see you reflecting the cute soon numbers the boats fairly well for the next few months\nI mean we've put together a chart that sort of have\nA clear case of the importance of crude oil and we and our clients can easily access to the TV is always this is what's happening with non oil economic growth and we added WPRI as well [noise]\nThis is good news for the Saudi economy isn't it but what does it mean really for the private sector where the hope was that with lower oil prices reforms would accelerate\nSo obviously it's positive because at the end of the day we are still in an oil a dependent a region or an economies continue to rely very heavily on the price that commodity so uh Seventy five Seventy six dollars which is where we all today that's clearly a positive\nOr a ... for the region now going forward we need to see a reform and restructuring of the economy\nAnd typically what she would see with an economy that is restructuring you'd have to it's very tough fears and an economy would stop to pick up see the so called okay in fact if you like\nUm that doesn't seem like it's going to happen in the region because although we felt a little bit of pain we don't see what's going to happen over the next two to three years there's no no clear plan as to how that reform is going to feed into increased economic growth and higher corporate profits\nTime much of a concern is that we put together ... an eyeball we've just had another another missile launch from Jay Powell talking about right in the markets re pricing next year and this is very important for all markets have because we have the bag and you make the point the currency peg has forced writes higher fits constraints have\nSay as most they

speaking about the gradually increase in defense rates over the last couple of years and those are now likely to continue with consequences for the region and clearly when an economy needs some relief\nThe last thing that you want to have as high interest rates are so not only do you have high interest rates now that are affecting economic growth in corporate profits but also stock valuations are so the ... ads who ... for example the risk free rates of return yeah I'm starting to look relatively unattractive to where it was a year or two back\nSo where does the Emirates them in comparison to Saudi Arabia is the more attractive proposition from an investment perspective is valuations come down and contribute considerably developers have been absolutely so far this here my opportunity for ...\nI think so I think um although the economy and device specifically as being a performing rather poorly one would have to say this year\nThe valuations such um and you saw the IMF grade and economic uh growth prospects I'm In a given what oil prices are so I'm actually relatively positive for buying into the Dubai and with the stock market the current levels\nWe saw quite a

so are the Kuwaiti markets been performing quite well recently um Kuwait to being the perennial\nA lie God then films of reform but we could we started to see some emphasis in terms of what the
