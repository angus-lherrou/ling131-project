C. of radio\n\nI don't really have to go and they had that Bloomberg Technology coming up in our twenty Nineteen couldn't be the ear canal England and ideas from the last ... million fine and paying nine million dollar loan from the same and bang behind in Japanese wireless IBM [noise]\nSlowed down and we talk on the company that more of a model three one lives and they may the electric car and how they could hurt the company\nLegalizing marijuana and how the nation's largest where our will compete with companies and joining green regime\nOur top story and twenty Nineteen is shaping up to be a big year for IPO's softbank is lined up commitments from loan about nine million dollars for its giant ... will find that the banks providing this money including underwriters 'em sock thanks wireless business I P L among them Goldman Sachs and\nComes a day after news broke that we can see listings for on demand delivery service ... as well as rival ride hailing companies were analyst joining us to discuss from New York we have learned to Elizabeth ... tax\nSelena way 'cause we don't want to start with you a first of all I explain this alone that softbank is getting I'm from the banks that's doing the I Know for the wireless fitness\nSo we've reported that they've received commitments nine billion dollar loan and this will be for its vision find which I mean no just need more and more capital to fuel these enormous sets in technology that they're making and these are coming from the same bank that are under riding the appeal of wireless unit [noise]\nAnd it's not entirely unusual for companies to pick banks that works with them on past deals for IPO's and we've reported that Matteo she signed with essentially ...\nDeal for IPO's and we've reported that Matteo she started with a centrally telling the banks will you know to sweet and the deal to be part of the enormous ikea which could be twenty seven billion dollars we'd also like for you to load to another part of the softbank empire but what is unusual in that case isn't that\nThe loan wouldn't be given to the same part of the business got these things would be under writing it would be given to a different unit entirely which would be the vision fund that is I feel is a big deal for softbank it means that Moscow is going to be able to really separate this deal making aspect of the business division find with the operational telecom view it\nTo make of of the unusual nature of this alone in the context of what's happening with Saudi Arabia and the fact\nAh you know the Saudi Government continues to deny these allegations that's connected to the murder of of this journalist at the same time that you know soft banks divisions bond has taken a lot\nOf money from the Saudi Government yeah we've always had already seen the effect on ... the ... the last couple of days\nOf that situation but I think that has been going on behind the scenes for a long time a setting aside and this is something that must have been talking to the ... for a while we were ... last week that they sort of chosen those banks who are going to walk on the detail\nThat they've been talking to them for a while so this is kind of part of that process I think it's quite set ... it'll be interesting to see you know how that plays out the next couple of months but for the moment being the focus is on the patio\nAnd we now have we gotten any word from softbank about their response to this you know international scandal and how it could affect that\nI've been asking asking in right now there is no on the record comment but I think what we can glean is that they're likely still\nAnd the wait and see what they want to see the full results\nOf this case although it's looking increasingly bleak and dark before they release\nAny substantial statement and now it's possible that they'll want them to cancel even entirely the ... and the other they may want them to postpone the event we've also been speaking to many of the portfolio companies we know that the c._e._o. has already pulled out there are other stars that are considering we're moving ... themselves for the conference as well\nBut it's very hard from the perspective of the start of because they want to attend this event to be able to reach that enormous Middle Eastern market but at the same time they don't want to be associated with a regime that's come under so much international pressure for such a horrible thing\nOver yet again in an awkward position especially given that ah that they've taken billions of dollars in investment\nFrom softbank meantime Elizabeth well you know we've got new information about Hoover's financial IPALCO potentially next year potentially at a hundred and twenty billion dollar ... valuation which is almost twice on what to expect in that round that softbank invested in\nYeah that's right I mean it's not unusual for the first ... Iran they still seem very very large can't remember what the snap here last year the evaluation so we're talking about for the belly and she said that company go close to twenty so we should do tend to not ... and towards the lower end and among sort of leading up to a listing\nThings we should really think of as the numbers that banks are putting out that when the pitching for this why can they really want to win it\nSo you know talk about what we know about the the Hoover and lift offerings how we expect those to proceed potentially one right after the other or even at the same time\nSo they are expected to be listed next year they're certainly going to be sort of race for who goes first because whoever lift versus really going to set the market expectation the precedent for the following lifting now ... obviously\nSeveral times larger but lift has really capitalize on some of the struggle over over the past several years increasing market share as a result of those struggles\nNow as Elizabeth said the evaluations are incredibly last day and they should be taken with a very large grain of salt we've seen several listings recently and in including show me Snapchat of ended up lifting at you know less than half\nOf expectations just months before they were actually sold to investors so wild evaluation for over right now they're expected to be you know as much as a hundred and twenty billion dollars it's really going to come down to what the investors make of the actual underlying financials of Hoover of lift which both still are very unprofitable\nFor two companies that\nA you know almost exactly the same business in many respects overs basis of course it is much bigger and more diverse\nFor two companies like that's been going public at exactly the same time yeah absolutely\nThere is yeah I'll tell you about ten to twenty fourteen to say it but within a few months to them we used to Ali Baba and Jay data combined go out of the gates within months of each other and a scene that said that when he sort of the first one is that\nUh that people are looking to see how the reaction is but I think from the private market valuations that both of these companies and the interest is going to be invested appetite for both\nAnd Elizabeth what can you tell us about a potential posts made\nOffering right it's so much smaller company sort of semi connected if you think about food delivery and the same sort of breath as cars and you know some of the um driverless technology that's happening that but a much more interesting but it's going to go into a crowded market because we're talking about the first half of a\nTwenty Nineteen here which is you know the same time that we're not hearing for a vote which has shifted forward a little

um they're all Sunnis enhanced relationship with government and academics to understand that threat and to cooperate to meet this more fully had um\nThe government's role needs to be to help these

people forget that even exist is\nIt's important for the public to see these transcripts from Don Yunior\nI think a lot of them began to understand what I've learned for the last two years of this

were those and the Trump world of communicating on an ongoing basis and paid at the very least attempting to conspire with the Russians I Believe the transcripts has released will bear that out I
