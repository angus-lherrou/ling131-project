companies buying open source software pioneer red hot for thirty three million dollars it's one of the biggest technology deals have are the boats IBM and hot spell check Bloomberg earlier about the sale\nAnd we've been working with IBM for many many many years\nAnd really over the course of this entire year are we starting to do to do more together or we made some big announcement said may um at our summit more work that we're doing together shooting and I really started speaking more seriously back in the polls and so it's been something that's just going to continue to evolve and\nYou know just became a natural next or\nIn terms of what's why we see so much value for red hat is we do see tremendous opportunity for open source in the enterprise and it's the leader there and we see just do large market than a growing market in front of us\nWhat we lack is scale that are good market we've lasted a customer relationships because again we're a newer player kind of coming uh we live in the industry vertical expertise and you know we last just the overall level and so we need to meet their full potential\nMight be and brings all of that together we can dramatically celery the red hot\nI'd be brings all of the so together we can dramatically salary to run out of business and what we do today and then together be able to offer unique offerings they can continue to grow IBM's business as well\nSo it was a dream that one of them from your point of view from the border not just being brought up to the ... because a lot of people said make a move this is a big move it was just going to be not your biggest one of your biggest moves during her tenure as to why did you decide that this was going to be your life or at least an important part of your like I said\nWe've been reshaping IBM for this moment and this is to me all about resetting the entire cloud landscape and this is the inflection point to do it because if you look at our clients chapter one of the clouds over they moved the easy twenty percent the cost savings that they wanted to get done that's done but the eighty percent ahead\nThat is a one trillion dollar market in this is the moment and to go after it they need a hybrid cloud they need to a gym and I do together they need hybrid meaning on premiere private cloud many public clouds\nThey need it based on open standards they tell us they're tired of the lock and the other clouds are awesome locking we are the true open source of the portable answer for them and we need to manage multiple clouds and they also had data now spread everywhere\nThat we can securely pull altogether so this next chapter is the one trillion markets eighty percent of their workload are going to move in gym just talked about our industry expertise or services our ability to do that\nAnd we're going to give them that answers a week catapult ourselves into number one and and you have to remember June Linux IBM open source we together are the biggest contributor to the open source community we have a long history and legacy of that\nAnd Linux has the starting point for the cloud and it's a destination so when I say they used to we own the starting point and the end point now that is a great move for IBM and it's why\nIt's still really accelerating all of IBM and good for our high value models\nIBM chairman and CEO junior Maddy and read how the game for white hertz speaking earlier with the break America now let's take a deeper dive into the deal now with your eyes managing director of equity research Bush securities and Bloomberg intelligence in yourself for analysts enter I'd run out\nAnd and our I Want to start with you I mean you remember the days when I covered this company back in twenty Thirteen to twenty Fifteen\nShe's now with the inflection point to cloud some folks might argue that inflection point already happened when you take her finally kind of making this mission that they can't do that and house and they gotta buy it\nI think should they should have done and I was a show like this long time ago when you and I were talking in those days\nThough they didn't do that they were hanging out on ... and um that hasn't really done much for their own business I think but you know the thing in principle can really reshape lord of the things that they do\nIt can be shipped their software practice and it can also be shipped to global business ... when you know they have learned will companies like accent children to low it and kept him and I don't go for it\nAnd not go a little bit that there is a socket still a majority of the NATO down when you think about um how this ethnic God's get integrated Cheney made her name on that third inside integrating Pete and he's the consulting back in the day\nHow much pressure is on her to actually have a seamless integration with red hat into the broader culture and products for IBM\nSimilar there's a lot of heat and the kitchen for them to integrate the successful indefinitely comes it'll risks Rob is opportunities you know she talked about because right now for cloud they needed to make a big strategic but\nYou know if you look at it there's medium where red a handful of others but if they were going to do what they need to do it now definitely appears to weed but the integration is going to be the key for the street and I'm Talking to competitive oil you know like how does this affect Microsoft\nAmazon to horse racing clout can IBM become the number three player that's where the key here\nShaking messing up rates right now I think the acquisition that Amazon is that the number one and a leader who is most fearful of the combo of ban right I\nMean I'm a zone and Microsoft continue their dream cat but she knows right now I mean it continues to be their world and everyone else is paying rent in terms of cloud\nBut I think fundamentally speaking to smaller players but I think you're seeing a lot of consolidation quote arrow Hornet works I didn't choose to start bringing us who are more him in a in ... and there's just the tip of the iceberg ... you know well the scale that's really going to be the issue with these two players coming together\nAnd that didn't seem to be out of what to do this to talk about red hat half the growth but this small size IBM has this scale but as we know revenues fallen by about quarter ... Cheney took over and twenty twelve\nDo investors now I look at IBM as a guard story there raining buybacks they're not getting out as much cash as this change the narrative for them\nTo enrich talked about you know six seven years ago that they shouldn't be doing finish and then they should be buying more companies like this um this does give them a lot of good products to sell to the market I think you know the one that we can actually happen as it could benefit somebody like Amazon and Microsoft for ... because\nYou could shift mood we'll go to the club and the question for me as really do they really are are are they going to be really opened in terms of looking ... rent out products to move some of the products to\nOthers closed and not just go out and say hey why don't you move is to IBM's called I think that to me is a big thing because I'm not open I think that could be a fish\nCan write had three working with Amazon they're working with Microsoft I Am sure um I guess how is that cultural shift for IBM to say look our our products to the kind of cloud agnostic do they have to kind of change their DNA to make that work\nOr they have to I mean there is no way out of it we have seen with Microsoft is the only way to show people that you ought to ignore stick to whoever the ... and you're going to work with everybody else you try to stick in your own technology in between I think they will be and put a price\nAnd and I want to come back to your point that you may Dan about software acquisitions I covered the ... face every one is talking that software is probably worth that any conduct earth are are kind of slow for their own reasons\nIn terms of uh the knock on effects at the tail who do you think should be looking at who's out there that potential target which of the big tech companies I Will need their own red hot\nLet's say to a lot to be in the next\nThing right now you are going to the core tech players that are going out there I mean obviously like Microsoft or go Cisco ... we're going to look and I think right now you can names like pivotal in terms of some players that could be consolidation can\nAnd the new I peeled are getting picked on every other day\nFor ... and look and and this dislocation is what we've been telling investors while they stopped coming down thirty forty percent you should teach it as well as financial buyers when they're when bids so then what this does do as opposed to business sector shoes were insure them valuations are in terms of ... on the cloud space\nAnd I think this is definitely a positive but now really comes down to rubber meets the road in other words one of the ramifications for the Neal is IBM successful and can they be number three player and where the impacts in the space\nAnd quickly here on the ... front valuations happen really high that's what kept strategic on the sidelines they haven't been buying felt like it hot tub and and the deal at a nice ... changed and that narrative for buyers and the opening their pocketbooks now\nWe're going to see a surge in them and I over the next twelve to Eighteen months now the window I think it's sort of get a job with a red at this shorter in our opinions were the tip of the sphere in terms of ...\nBright and when you look at Facebook obviously and stir and I've kinda been pushed into the limelight here as the main core faith a product has had some issues\nHow much pressure is on Instagram kept perform especially in the context of you know near ear thing of taxonomy of mismanagement Instagram leaders are now out the door water investors are looking for out of that part of the business\nI think first of all investors or look at the wrong things when they can Instagram because Instagram is an integral part of Facebook when it comes to the way they make money and the way that they're run\nNot withstanding the change in management uh there's one sales force for the combined entity there's one pool of advertising unless you believe they're going to take a twenty billion dollar capital expenditure budget and funded to build a rocket to Mars establish the new economy the new advertising ecosystem there is one pool of advertising budget that they can chase\nAnd so Instagram exposed to that just as Facebook is and so as one pool of advertising um you know it's the same issue ... on the

an important part of your like I say\nWell we've been reshaping IBM for this moment and\nThis is to me all about resetting the entire cloud landscape and this is the inflection point to do it because if you look at our clients chapter one of the clouds over they moved the easy twenty percent the cost savings that they wanted to get done that's done but the eighty percent ahead\nThat is a one trillion dollar market and this is the moment and to go after it they need a hybrid cloud they need to a gym and I do together they need hybrid meaning on premise private cloud many public clouds\nThey need it based on open standards they tell us they're hired in the lock and the other clouds are often a lock and we are the true open source of the portable answer for them and we need to manage multiple clouds and they also had said now spread everywhere\nThat we can securely pull all together so this next chapter is the one trillion market eighty percent of their work lives are going to move him just talked about our industry expertise our services are ability to do that\nAnd we're going to give them that answer so we catapult ourselves into number one and and you have to remember Jim Linux IBM open source we together are the biggest contributor to the open source community we have a long history and legacy of that\nAnd Linux says the starting point for the cloud and it's a destination so when I say it's safe to say we own the starting point and the end point now that is a great move for IBM and it's why it's still\nReally accelerating all of IBM and good for our high
