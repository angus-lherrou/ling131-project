Catholic and\nThink I can add life here\nI think the significance is that they deliver more cars and they produced in the last quarter I said they're finally getting rid of some of the image tore that was hanging around um surprisingly the stock is sort of needed team which is interesting and the big question is can add like is there still a huge demand for these cars are that a multiplier effect as more of them had the for a while and in fact\nCan search on the back of the news that I think that was the case of some of that with already\nOfficially settled with the ... some of that was already baked in coffee demand plot telling is that what you're saying these numbers\nWere not saying that at all I mean hats off to Tesla eighty thousand is great but we're similarly saying demand and investment from all the other automakers as well I mean we're as you mentioned in the opening we we're the largest provider of the infrastructure of public networks in the country and we are building as fast as those as we possibly can\nIrritate limits in from Audi Porsche talked about\nThe competition will face and a coming quarters as other carmakers step up\nWell that's right I mean in the first quarter of this year there were a kind of some of about a hundred billion dollars of investment announced by the ... around the world I mean that includes the Europeans the Japanese um and the American auto makers and those are real announces with a real investments that are coming and since then\nUm every week we seem to get more and more news I mean the dime or promoted a an ... person to run the company and you you mentioned Audi as announced that they try a couple of weeks ago I'm at the Chinese auto makers are going going great guns I mean again we all saw the Saudis

short amount of time\nAnd then you had owners volunteering and storage Tesla owners turning on and drove to help 'em get they've carved out talk to us about what our Catholic him to stay in the effort to put in this quarter to ... to meet these numbers under intense pressure I'm going for it\nYeah I mean there's always another hill for Tesla Klein I mean they were able to get out these deliveries because you know people showed up in stores and we're really helping I'm sure everyone has exhausted and then they're going to have to do it again and the fourth quarter but this is really seen as a watershed moment not just for the company but for the mainstreaming of electric vehicles as a whole and I think you know here in California I see more and more model three is on the road all the time\nCaffeine of course the infrastructure half the Cape you know what can be done to super charge if you will the development of the infrastructure across the country to support\nWhat you believe is increasing demand for what we're doing it we're we're building we're building not just in California I mean we're increasing our presence in California where most of the eighties and the country are\nBy the end of this year us the tickets on average fifty percent and a fifty percent of both the bay area and the LA markets ... to meet demand\nWe're similarly doing build out in Boston in in the state of Virginia where we were awarded the um the a Volkswagen diesel gauge money\nTo um as a penalty but to help the Virginia build out its infrastructure we're seeing this across the country and

impact them and they're going to continue to need to buy the cars\nWe are in fact seen acceleration of construction of the Shanghai factory correct\nYou know it's not really going what is it doesn't really say that they really want to accelerate it because of the terrorists that imports on top of cars now face in China\nAnd\nCaffeine talking about the implications of that for the broader market obviously China is a huge market now sort of steeped in controversy as a result of the trade war\nWhat look the that China is a huge market the Chinese manufacturers are scaling up and what's fascinating to me is as as all of you in the German carmakers the American car makers are are all of that we're seeing a presence there\nThat the the thing about them accelerating market is that I have not met somebody who's driving the navy who would ever go back to not and we've got\nThree concurrent factors that are really really pushing this market one is it the performance of the car is a

didn't didn't strike Trump has promised as they made and the and in that on the campaign trail for a ... maybe ... alleviating policy but not necessarily stimulating the economy long time to get\nYou know I think when you look at that ... you can see is pretty extraordinary ... tree because we've we've had\nThis enormous declined and unemployment and yet inflation still bumping along a very low levels no new risk of it really gave ... even talk and say you have to say we've had several years with an unusual about unusual combination what was interesting in the speech\nWas that he was still power still highlighting this risk\nThat unemployment or could be able to fully even further so we can find out is even more capacity in the labor market than we thought even though we've just full of ... fewer than one uh unemployed person for every job opening down ... down from I think twelve to one at the peak of the recession\nAnd he was highlighting that risk as well as the risk of inflation might take off and we tend to always focus just on the inflation and we look at them raising rates but I thought it was interesting that he was still talking about this is an even handed way and that was justifying hands\nSaying he was completely calm about being gradual\nI mean it just to your point on the inflection point we had a note from Tracy Morgan they beam did the math and again they looked at the average interest rates and developed economies and waited for output and I asked one percent for the first time since two thousand and nine and that sort of ... so so that that\nCrossover came with the fed raising rates last week really lose than it is really historical basis just to looking at the external interlinked queen\nBee what's rates and the rest of the world and the risk that they bring to each other I mean can the fed continue with its path\nAnd continue to ignore what's happening in emerging markets since they are struggling and they are in pain\nBut we have to tell them that the markets that are struggling and actually the economics we've looked at which ones are most vulnerable and you can find on the on the timing of the ones that are kind of flashing red\nBut relative to the past if you get back into ancient history you know when I was like in the U.S treasury was in the late nineties in the age of financial crisis and then you had to hold sway the pledging market economies that we're in terrible trouble and the numbers are much more extreme than most that you see now\nSo I think we have to sort of keep it in a ... that was also at a time when ... was raising rates and that causes trouble for that so that financing\nThat feels like that problem there is some pressure on emerging markets but it feels a bit more like twenty fourteenth twenty Fifteen ... something really ties\nBut at the time it's going to have to take into account the rest of the well I'm not sure it has to quite yet\nThat so that's a because there is one gentleman quite often ... his mom and dad and his latest called in terms of is it the right time to jump into a a\nHigher oil prices stronger dollar slowing growth and tightening financial conditions are not a great cocktail for most emerging markets so in the short term be careful\nThis is not the time for the anti divergence crate and we'll come but not here\nDuring that proposition\nMerchants crate and we'll come but not here\nLet's bring that proposition to August in Singapore tech Lang time\nFor you and the facts prison is it too soon to jump into effect of course Mohammed that I was very specifically to the challenges for am but what about your call on and what did you buy the peso this level at Fifteen size and the Indonesian I pay so would you buy the repeat what would you do not space\nFully agree that this is not that the time to jump in in ... of insight\nBomb you bring up the um Indonesian unreal Fifteen thousand we have a short them target for me to go to Fifteen thousand in seven fifty so we're looking at another five percent down um especially for these will be much more common diseases we denature um I Would strongly agree that\nUm at least for this to sell the U.S economy is managing the ... away from the global economy partly because of the fiscal stimulus that trauma administration is a is implementing ... going to go to the Nineteen and twenty runs us growth is actually coming from ...\nTo point ... percent to about ... fall and even two percent by the end of two thousand twenty\nBut us actually might find yourself a bit harder to be arguing that it is actually in New and do everything that he's happening out of the well so I Would actually say that when it comes to the emerging market currency is the best time would actually be the dining hall that brought a dollar index and that turning point on the dollar itself may actually is focusing will be in about six months' time which is\nAnother five to seven percent

tickets and let it go and labor pressure saying that a hike will take effect from November the facts rainy in a sense to\nHave the detail\nAmazon employees and the U.S cheered when they got the news the company was raising the minimum wage to Fifteen bucks that applies to all three hundred and fifty thousand\nFulltime part time as well as\nSeasonal employees who will be hired for the upcoming holiday season all thirty seven thousand UK employees will also be getting a new minimum wage is ten pounds fifth day or about Thirteen dollar sixty in London and a bit lower in the rest of the country and\nJeff Bezos Amazon's CEO said we listen to her critics undecided we want to lead we encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us\nNow interestingly on days I was saying Amazon and wanted to leave though a lot of analysts point out it's been accused actually of treating its workers unfairly and that includes the various lawsuits that includes allegations that he was contract employees to avoid the regulations\nAnd that even includes Bernie Sanders the former presidential candidate who said Amazon workers are paid so low that they need public assistance to make ends meet\nBut today's Sanders congratulated ... it was for doing quote the right thing and in terms of costs it could only only cost one to two billion dollars that's according to loop capital\nNow it sounds like a lot I Know but against annual operating costs the ballpark of about sixty billion dollars in really isn't all that much\nAnd then against Amazon's nearly one trillion dollar mark and

lot of the savings that they've been able to make up for natural gas with the higher oil prices are now going away Egyptians town looks like it's coming under pressure\nDefinitely uh it must be coming under pressure because we're seeing that across the emerging market space\nUm uh but it is you know quite closely managed um there is a great deal of concern I think in each of that they would be a currency weakness coming around we feel that um the currency would actually be stable as we head into your end because there's been such a great a negative impact from the evaluation all ready\nWe think for the devaluation would April first of all they would weigh considerably on on the population which is already suffered from\nYou know in some cases a tripling and in the cost of a a basic necessities\nBut also I think it would open the once you have a small evaluation it would really would open the doors I think to a much more conservative suspected of attack against the the pound\nThat if a such a small devaluation can occur then there's obviously a room for more to a more to go through and it might actually a work against other central banks best interest in it if that would be an out\nSo we think it would actually sort of Egypt's interests all better to maintain stability and and would stand the impact of any further weakness and given that we have that central
