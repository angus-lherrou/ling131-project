TV which has the Instagram video platform\nVery very early stages but what you do see is tremendous engagement across the Facebook apps and the family of apps I should say and that creates a big long term opportunity I think that's what the street is excited about it they're just beginning to give hands of monitors Asian for all of these things beyond the core news feed\nTalk about their different battlefields as as as you mentioned that we don't often does he also with respect to apple I talked about how you know apple is a story I messages on on iPhones on on servers and um\nIt was a very different times in a very different tone from our soccer bark much war in Iraq and we were in prior years one strategy is there I think\nHe's trying him really paint a picture of how difficult it's going to be but that he's excited about the future that Facebook Stories and the whole story it's product across Facebook Instagram and\nIt's actually going to be a bigger sharing format than the news fade over time and I think that was one thing that helped\nInvestors get us a sense of what the vision is they're not just rather and he's going to slow in the short term and it's going to be tough to monetize those things but eventually more people will be using that so I think he was trying to get a sense of how big these things could be that and watch could eventually be as big as you tune that\nAre used to think of messenger like math and she was trying to get people a picture for how to think about the future of the company\nCan lay out a great argument for why we still believe in fate but what about all the skepticism about all the mistakes day's main what about\nHaving a lackluster laughter engagement with their core product\nWhich is when you\nI Would just echo um\nSarah's comment on like ...\nIs a huge business huge I mean I I look at Instagram and go misses the modern day cure for board I mean you know mark you when you talk about TV being the cure for boredom\nThe cure for ... have been twenty Eighteen is Instagram people are using it anywhere they go to kill a moment in time time spent has exploded in use his now up to a million people I mean this is the dominant cure for boredom for people all around the world\nIt's going to grow from one billion to two billion users time spent as growing it's basically becoming the mall where everybody finds goods and services that they are interested in the targeting is incredible\nI I think as you look at that product you can make a pretty you know you could make a reasonable argument that over the next five years and be seven years but that Instagram will be bigger business then core Facebook and look maybe they get Facebook Stories to work I don't know over what timeframe and may work better in other countries\nBut I Believe that the growth potential of Instagram over the next five to seven years as they get things like stories monitors Asian to really kick in they've already got the users monitors Asian that really has to kick in\nAs they figure out commerce and story monitor physician let alone communication on that platform Instagram seems like a beast that really is going to create tremendous value for Facebook shareholders are yes there's only been mistakes are definitely been challenges in terms of cleaning up the news feed and making it you know a safer place\nIt's the Internet there's lots of challenges with that Google had those challenges that everyone's having those Twitter obviously there's lots of companies having those challenges but when you look at the long term meaning three to five you're up return is facing Facebook I think there's a great growth story for investors and I think that's why the stock is responding so positively today\nCats coming up in the ... elections you know Facebook and what didn't\nWell in the Brazilian elections\nWhat are we expecting to the in the next week I think\nThat Facebook is still working it out I mean they're doing every day finding new ways that the platform means being taken advantage of their reacting to reports in the media about certain\nPockets of their universe that are they're needing attention and meeting accounts that needs to be deleted that's still happening so you only get to the terms I think they have their war room their attention is on this but it's still going to be a process of whack a mole as they try to figure this out I mean their system is filled base\nOn content that goes viral content that gets shared right this is still the stuff that people are clicking on and this is still it makes sense if money and so it's going to be very difficult for them to really make meaningful change in the meantime it's going to be very reactive\nNow branch in the last two months over the last year we've seen the founders of laptop\n... ... the company we've seen a broader protest from users about privacy about how Facebook handles their data and there seems to be this long term question over whether\nHe's going to buy that in the future by this idea that that Facebook can rent their data and make money off it no longer term concern\nOf course I Want to correct to things that you said one Facebook doesn't sell data to third parties or rent it out to third parties they use your data obviously to sell ads but they don't sell that data to third parties never have I think that's been kind of an ongoing kind of talked about talking point that he isn't factually true also when we're talking about users leaving\nOver all of these issues the data would show that Facebook users on a daily basis continue to grow on a sequential basis and I'm not talking about moving from Facebook to answering but actual Facebook users\nContinue to grow you know they've never gone down on on a global basis and even in the U.S they were flattened if not for a change in how their accounting that she would have grown this quarter and so I think there is this perception that people are fleeing Facebook but they're actually not\nIt's not growing the way it used to which is certainly a fair criticism but the kind of the fall for somehow this changing in consumer behavior\nBusiness of market information that ... exists this game of chicken is going to end and we will you find information on political events around the globe is this going to have an impact\nOn the Chinese economy

in San Francisco in ... ... ... ... so if they can can wind up getting a ...\nYou know where am I had always insisted that they wanted to build the technology that didn't require the driver so that they would be the first company to sort of get a permit to do that is fitting because that's always been there conviction\nIt's made them sort of go really slowly they'd been reluctant out these pilot programs with the driver and the front seat and so now we're going to see if there are sort of theory of the world that you need a fully autonomous vehicle that can work without a driver is going to pay off\nI was actually one of the very first job to get in and go south driving car that within two thousand a letter right um so what\nThe importance of having federal legislation care\nOne thing that's important understand right now is that there's nothing in the ...\nThere's nothing in federal law that actually prohibits a company\nFrom fielding a fully autonomous vehicles where the legislation that's being debated right now in the Senate is important\nIs that it would allow companies to feel a lot more cars that are exempt from federal safety standards that require things like steering wheel like foot pedals so if you ... it ... it was really going to go all the way for toward the vision\nOf having a truly driverless car that doesn't need normal driver focused elements of vehicle design\nAnd could deploy it at scale\nThey'll need these exemptions and that's one of the big reasons that companies have been back in this legislation\n... founder of without having car radical acts for a long time he told me he's given a town hall with his family in a car and driving car and yeah there are still have questions or they can be done there articles all the time about the mistakes that these cars are making that challenges I mean\nFundamentally the problem with self driving car is how do you know what you know you can't solve you know there are all these\nCases in the tech people like to talk about the edge of the problems that they know they can't solve yet but they hope to solve soon\nAnd I think the industry has been very bad at predicting just how long that would take and now that those problems still continue to exist it's hard for anyone to give a sure and says that sort of everything will be solved so I think there is a lot of cynicism\nJust waiting to sort of hammer out what do you do if someone's waving a car on but you have a fully autonomous vehicle\n[noise] Ryan certain states have had a you know\nMore than other therapies accidents than with some of the experiments you know how does what we're seeing at the federal level differ from what the states are doing when it ... legislating\nWell I I think you\nBring up a really important thing and and that is the the actors that we've seen earlier this year and a in Arizona involving over in in California involving test all of those two fatalities\nThey just recently and DC are starting to see some signs that that ... that that's starting to have an impact on starting to sort of affect the way federal regulators are of even the the technology\nUm you're starting to see some signs that that that but even the Trump Administration is starting to look at this new technology with a little bit more skepticism um it's also in bowling and and and and giving some ammunition to stay the advocates\nWho are basically saying that look there's this artificial rushed to pass legislation at the federal level\nOr it doesn't need to go this fast we need to take our time\nOn that no

changed I think one of the most fascinating questions is uber prepares for the I. P. O. is going to be whether the company and try to set up a separate vehicle for self driving cars\nSo that you know if you're a self driving bowl you can invest in that and if you're driving berry you can have exposure to uber without sort of worrying about self driving cars and kind of like how is super expensive you know I'm sure when they file we're going to see a huge research and development costs that they're going to attribute to self driving cars\nSo you know dark I was just shy is going to have to sort of decide where the CFO\nDo we think we could be more valuable with this as part of the company or with it as sort of majority owned by the company would outside investors like\n... and kept it up a shame fully behind and find taxing\n[laughter] but we're not going to get out on the record he said and you know they get sort of a lot of pictures from bankers are considering sort of a lot of different things so I think he's\nShown sort of an openness to sort of maximize or whatever makes most financial sense river but he hasn't really showed his hand on whether they really would spin it out um or get some sort of big outside investor or anything like that\n... is thinking about\nOf apple hardware overhaul be what it means right before the holiday we'll talk about that at one\nCrime shipping on training at technology and he tried to follow our global breaking news network\nAt ...

shopping\nHumans do you have a vehicle hit three churches and test drive\nWhat I see is a crisis of inequality in San Francisco I mean that is what is striking to me we have Seventy billionaires here in our city that's incredible we have companies that you report on\nWith hundreds of billions of dollars a market cap of course you know sales force we're the largest employer here in San Francisco not just the largest tech and Blair largest employer we have a hundred billion dollar market cap\nAnd you just talked about a few companies square where it's thirty below quarter were twenty billion a striped twenty billion\nPretty quarter were twenty billion a stripe twenty billion um\nThe amazing thing is these companies can afford it for us it's just a ten million dollar tax and these are immaterial amounts to us ten million dollars doesn't mean anything you know that's less than the private playing the Jack Dorsey is going to fly around on you know that and I'll tell you right now it's the money that we need\nTo make a difference here in San Francisco\nWell kept on a certain point for kind of a pain and fall and they will ever family which is why it's heartbreaking\nWell that's what I see that the homeless I see the the homeless aren't\nYou know getting the treatment they they need and that is they need shelter they need mental health treatment a treatment they need a treatments for their addictions and kids who are on the street I mean that's the most touching part these kids they've got to get into homes and we have the plant and we know how to do it we've been running very successful programs here in San Francisco for\nThe homeless now for years you know that I've been involved with them I funded my personally tens of millions of dollars for homeless programs\nAnd what I've found is that we know how to do it but we need more funding now it's just on the phone with the mayor sheen is an emergency funding of six million dollars for me\nTo get a shelter open in the tenderloin that's because she's out of money\nAnd if you look at other politicos are supporting this Well Nancy Pelosi supporting the Senator Dianne Feinstein is supporting this Jackie Speier is supporting this and not just me truck Robbins who's the CEO Cisco Systems and Cisco Systems were also supporting a sea of the basically the region's nations\nTo are just tech employers right here it's a quarter trillion dollars a market cap between salesperson Cisco we're both supporting prop see we think this is right for business because homelessness has been so tough on our business there\nPlenty of rain had made homeless that's one of her as soon as I have not supporting national thinks that can be a regional more structured corrosion\nKennesaw hotter than what happened on her head\nWell of course all of this kind of created way before Lehman breed became our mayor and this has put together by our city is the very top homeless advocates in fact the people who are on her staff and her team had been involved in putting together our top hell wants to NGOs or putting them together\nAnd really even the experts at UC herself who worked with other cities like Salt Lake city and our national debt programs that have gotten them off the streets have put it together so I have a lot of confidence in the program and I think this is the right thing for our city and look big business pays the consumers don't pay on this assist our top fifty businesses\nYou know in San Francisco they're going to pay a very small tax but to deal with our number one issue and that's why I'm supporting proposition C\nI Know you're trying to raise money for that primary as well you try to make money from his ... kind of something or other heckler he's failing tired\nWell thank you for opening the door I mean you know we are constantly raising money here in San Francisco you know that because you help me out quite a bit so thank you for everything that you are doing and everything that Mike Bloomberg is doing Mike Bloomberg is probably one of the most generous people and the whole country's given over six billion dollars of his fortune away incredible\nWell here in San Francisco we have our own phone proper needs when we had our north bay fires a year ago we raised\nForty million dollars the people were complaining about this they didn't give us money for that\nOf course we just raise forty million dollars to get every child off the streets in San Francisco and we have now got hundreds of ... of a family is off the streets in San Francisco with this program they didn't give us any money for that and of course we had our SF gives programs with tipping point\nWhere we raise tens of millions of dollars to help those most in need and San Francisco so the only thing that these guys are giving money to is the opposition to this proposition that the first time they've ever given any money to anything in San Francisco I guess it's good that they're giving [laughter]\nI Can't seem to catch him\nOut of the ... got a pipe bomb ... debate on social media ...\nCan be done I mean would you like to go back to around ...\nWhat I'd really like people to do is to just to open our hearts and be able to look at when they're walking down the streets and use the homeless adults and children on the street say there through the grace of God go by you know one of the things that I Love about San Francisco were built on\nThe patron saint um St Francis and he had a great phrase he said and giving it as receive that we receive an and given that we receive well that's how I look at proposition see you know the sea in my mind is for compassion the sea is for\nCharity or this is the very heart of what we do in the city and I think if you want to really make the world better then it's time to start giving and that that's the best way to let people know that we're carrying about them\nAnd kind of other companies like stuck in Pakistan that are causing trouble than your own ... and I wonder how\nWell you know how\nWell they will vote where our relationship is All right but I'm going to number one is the most important thing is that I feel like I Need to speak my truth and sometimes that means speak truth to power I've had a lot of phone calls\nFrom executives would get very unhappy when I say something like you know I said in January Facebook as the new cigarettes it's not good for you it's addictive it's being manipulated others are trying to get you to use it in ways you don't even understand all of that has turned out to be true and much worse than even I ever imagined\nAnd that's a tough conversation and and this is a tough conversation to her I said\nBusinesses the greatest platform for change we can fix the homeless situation in San Francisco right now all we have to do is vote for proposition ... and it's immaterial door business right now the financial numbers\nBut homelessness is material to my business and\nThat's a recession I don't want to give\nAnd take it on faith that anger over there it's not all of our ...\nHow they handle it and I feel like a bird head back on the earnings call me and the right side of history in the ... the\nCornish her tax yeah\nTim Cook Tim Cook for sure\nIs on the right side of history he and I both have called for national privacy law here in the United states\nYou know we have GDP are in Europe that's doing a fantastic job in Europe and protecting European citizens they have more protection and control than any other region in the world we need that here in the United states a lot of the privacy debates that we're having right in um\nOur city in San Francisco well we wouldn't be having that if we were in Paris or London or Munich and we need a national privacy law in the United states we need that now we need some of our great senators and some ... break congresspeople and they know who they are\nTo really say okay we're going to write this law and get this done we're we're trying to advocate for that we've been doing that for months that's going to help us to get through it because right now are data's being misused in ways that we don't even understand and all of that needs to come into the light look\nCompanies need to like really start to address their core values what is the most important\nThing to face but what is the most important thing to sales force for us we know is trust nothing is more than the Portland the trust we have with our key stakeholders that includes our customers are employers are partners and also are homeless you know the homeless or tea stakeholder a business what matters in San Francisco matters to me and it matters\nThey called her a business what matters in San Francisco matters to me and it matters to our employees and you know what even when they're on their way home from work and they're in their bart station near the you know it's it's becoming more difficult that's why I'm voting for proposition see\nNow that are ... maybe ... I Am a CEO flexibility are we going to pay more freedom than taking on why that she was ...\nWell I've been taking on issues like because you know\nThe issues that we talked about I mean that's just part of what I Do and it's part of what sales force does all over the world which is we fight for the quality of every human being as part of our core values and we so strongly believe that when one of our key stakeholders as impeded by a wall or by another organization or by a company\nThat we have to step in and that that's really why I'm supporting proposition see because I so strongly feel that our T stakeholders are\nEmployees customers are partners I mean I was even on a on air with another journalist or two days ago and that journalist was assaulted in a wall brands involving a homeless person and while they were here for dream force is that not something I should get involved in you know it should be your dream force\nI received lots of emails lots of phone calls from customers that come in from all over the world who said hey\nWhat's happening in your city I've never seen anything like this I'm sure you have your own stories your own personal experiences you have a lot of people come in from out of town to see you as well and also the coming come on the show here we're all here in the same thing San Francisco needs to make a change we need it now it's it's hit a tipping point that's why I'm supporting proposition\nC I went after that it's likely that fashion tend to go under fire for al ... cells for New York times or protecting high profile and that has been accused of sexual conduct promoting starving in his accept packages and then I'll get sidelined are pushed out of the company will go go go around here", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Florence", "day": "01"}
