they spend in the rate at which they spend your Netflix has managed to account in a way that makes it\nSeem like they're spending a little less money than they are on a profit and loss on they're kind of balance sheet statement they'll say that they've spent about seven million dollar me seven billion dollars so far this year\nAnd they're going to spend even more by the end so let's say this but account for nine billion on a cash basis they're spending a few billion dollars more than that which is why they have to keep raising money but the way that they claim that they're spending it a lot

to do that that's just the strategy\nI think they they need to do it if they want to keep increasing so\nTheir whole strategy is to to keep increasing to grab a larger share of the amount of time people spend watching videos so if you're spending an hour\nA day watching Netflix an hour an hour and a half they want to make that too and their way of doing it is to give me something\nThat you haven't seen before give me something new and they're not just doing that for their customers in the U.S they're doing it for an increasingly global audience if you noticed some of them the money that argues me some of the the bonds today weren't euros that's probably because the growing share of their audiences from Europe\nAbout the risk of all this that\nI think if you are nervous about them raising more money if you are nervous about the end of the Netflix model at all there are still analysts investors who say that this is unsustainable that wall you know I got an email from somebody last week\nThat Wall Street is stone not a brand name because they're so excited\nThat there's this company that kind of sexy anew and has all these shows that people people like and the model is insecure\nBut it's hard to imagine Netflix going anywhere at this point you know they have so many customers that are growing at such a rate the question is just can they keep that going it becomes a out of a valuation question are they a little bit overvalued probably is this a company that's disappearing anytime soon not at all\nAre they learning her cash at the same rate [noise]\nUh no [laughter] mostly been big media companies have\nI mean some of them are have plenty of LeBron like CBS for example has a lot of debt but most of the big media companies are very profitable and so they don't need to raise as much money they're also not increasing their content spend at the same rate that Netflix is\nSome of these other companies like apple and Amazon maybe they are because of the race that they're increasing but again you know apple sitting on so much cash\nThat it's not as big a concern for them the same for Amazon and these are companies that just how much more robust
