first of all how did this happen\nYou're right and then there's something to find them you know Google admitted in its own statement that you know use or I can gauge when it was very very low and this is something we as\nConsumers all now we probably download on Google Plus for ... minutes several years ago and I've never gone back to it but what happened is you know the profiles of ... of hundreds of thousands of people are still on Google Plus of course\nAnd this specific ... allowed a developer to requests of view of certain piece of user information so this would have included\nHearing name your email address there wasn't um sort of private messages that were sent the twin users that's not expose according to Google but some of that sort of basic identifying information was just sort of out there\nAccording to Google but some of that sort of basic identifying information was just sort of out there and open for any developers who had access to a PIN that figure this out to request it\nA little bit about the timeline in terms of when they realize that when they died at at least as are reporting goes to share it with the public\nSo we all know that obviously there's been this sort of firestorm of interest in privacy data security at the big tech companies over the last year or two years\nEspecially when it comes to Facebook and so in January of this year January twenty Eighteen Google internally decided to do a major security and data privacy review of all its products they want to make sure that this exact kind of thing wasn't out there um unbeknownst to them and\nThis is something that they found in March twenty Eighteen so this was right when Facebook was bearing the brunt of the Cambridge Analytica scandal right around the time that Martin soccer Burke was hauled in front of Congress to explain his company's actions\nAnd internally Google decided not to put that out there that's something that\nThey've admitted that they found it in March twenty Eighteen decided at the time that they didn't feel it was necessary to tell the public the wall Street Journal is reporting cutting their sources that Google made that decision because of the political pressure that they've seen out in space at the time\nSo how will this ratchet up the political pressuring Google has already been starting point not sending them on to testify as the weeks ago and Sheryl Sandberg to fail on Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter to testify he now scheduled to testify before Congress at some point in the coming weeks\nHow do you expect lawmakers will take today\nLawmakers are going to jump on this just like they've jumped on on every issue that not just Google but other tech companies have sort of had over the past couple of years\nGoogle has been getting a lot of attention in the last couple of months before that they had although how to pay some criticism they'd been kind of able to skate above the worst of it that had been reserved for Facebook and Twitter but now they're really at the center of it on the president tweeted\nAbout a month and a half ago that Facebook or sorry that Google was only showing negative news about his presidency was very upset about that\nA conservative politicians have said that\nGoogle has a liberal bias that they are suppressing liberal opinions on Google News and on YouTube\nAnd that they want that the change of course there's no evidence that this is happening\nGoogle continues to push back against it but it doesn't seem to be going away goal is continuing\nTo be a topic that politicians like to talk about and as we head into the midterms especially on the Republican side it seems that this company Facebook as well Twitter as well but Google is right in the in sort of the focus right now is a way for them to get their voters out so they're sending messages to their voters to their\nConservative voters that you know Google was a big bad technology company from California that isn't respectful of your privacy and is trying to shape the country towards a more liberal position and\nThis is something that seems to be gaining traction with some voters that doesn't look like it's an issue that's going to go away for Google\nAnd why do we know about the day at ... in the sense that\nThat still sort of being sorted out right now I personally don't have a lot of information and exactly what that is going to look like but of course especially with this news it just adds another thing that it's going to have to talk about\nAlright well ... thanks so much for weighing in a A R

market can absolutely recover we saw last year was the market really starting to twenty Seventeen and they were kind of disappear or all of a sudden that exploded and I think that was a combination of institutional investors are really sore crypto investors getting involved\nIn this retail hype is starting to build around it was excellent to use that made the whole space explode and what we saw was that was unsustainable at that time and the technology wasn't being developed fast enough to support that interest so we saw crash and everything it's slowly rise again as people get more sophisticated but the diligence they do so they understand which these projects going to be successful\nSo how has different today than they were last year\nI don't think I'd go to that different today than they were last year I think what's different is the investors\nThey're more investors with more sophistication coming into space and the existing investors getting more and more sophisticated about space\nBut the ideas are similar structure pretty similarly there slight changes some of them are raising smaller amounts raised over a longer period of time but at the end of the day is still the same type of project raising money and some were button veterans understanding which of these are good and what's your bad because at the end of the day so many of these projects are low quality in massive percentage of them and you really have to make sure filtering out those bad ones before investing in a good one\nPercentage that as regulators in the u._k. and the U.S considering how on MySpace shouldn't be regulated and what kind of regulation are you expecting and what kind of regulation hope\nFor I think about the big issue at least in the ice EOC specifically is issues of securities law are what these people are selling securities are they not securities and our perspective is generally that at the time of the sale almost all the security is a need to be regulated as such\nThat's a well trod well lit industry selling securities and buying securities and there's lots of regulation around out today I don't think it has to be different for the CEO industry there are some changes that will happen around the specifics there but at the you know when you look at it as a whole\nWho've been selling securities in the U.S private stories for decades and uh it's not going to change that much as we call it a token instead of a convert or anything else are\nWe at a new normal id say their potential for this route the route to return\nI I think it's such a cyclical industry at this point we don't know what's going to happen yet and uh and it's so immature so we got away with the system to develop at this point is so incredibly risky to invest in the space you got to make sure you're doing your diligence and we'll see ups and downs over the next couple of years of states which are kind of technologies actually ship and start to use for the

months ago\nWas it every single asset in the face of highly correlated bitcoin as highly correlated with a theory among highly correlate with basically every other assets the queen has started to

tokens and how to\nHow we allow its own afterwards to train a wider variety of clients for more we're joined by circled the oh Jeremy Alaska Jeremy I'm sure you've been looking into that conversation with any you know would you agree that\nI feel like different today than they were yesterday but that\nYou know period and ... and ... it's actually behind\nHer thanks for having me on yeah I mean I think one critical difference is that uh there's dramatically fewer ideas going on um and I think that's a result of a you know a couple of things one has been a increased amount of regulatory scrutiny around offerings and enforcement actions\nThat have been you know brought upon people who maybe\nThat illegal securities offerings or were outright trading fraud um the other obviously is that you know the vast vast majority of projects that did raise capital I'm have seen their values you know a calm down pretty dramatically and so\nBoth of those have to have I think reduced the number of token offerings but I think for us um\nThis is a a really critical period there was an incredible amount of infrastructure that is maturing and our belief is that\nYou know token eyes asset so using credit graphic tokens and smart contracts to create new types of assets is going to continue to grow and in fact we think over time there will be hundreds of thousands if not millions of took a nice assets that people are issuing trading and exchanging uh all around the world\nWhen you look at our long term vision you know we we acquired a popular crypto exchange earlier this year ... and when we acquired that I'm exchange\nWe made it very clear that are long term vision is to build a a kind of token marketplace where uh you know kind of multi sided marketplace for businesses and eventually even individuals can a issue and distribute token ice assets and then to provide a market for those to be able to me easily traded and exchanged\nThere's some really key missing pieces to really fulfill that vision or\nExchanged there's some really key missing pieces to really fulfill that vision or one is a lot of these tokens are going to be offered are going to be securities and so\nWe needed to be able to operate a broker dealer and operate within the regulatory framework of the FCC so said invest a owns and operates a broker dealer and had been really at the forefront of\nCrowd funding models and issuing and raising capital directly from investors using security over the Internet for the last five years they helped create the JOBS Act\nThey helped launch many of the first equity crowdfunding models including from on accredited investors which is part of the democratization of finance that gets people so excited about things like token offerings but doing that within this regulated security space\nAnd then the other is you know they built out an end to end platform to help businesses to assess businesses to underwrite them to manage their uh their security offering to do the kind of marketing and distribution that's needed to help generate awareness and and find investors and those are all capabilities that we want to be able to have\nAs we build out this multi sided marketplace for the token as they should have assets\nCan't say that's bringing on more credit or retail investor\n[noise] you know the power of token as Asian is that you know more and more types of assets can be represented in a ... of liquid tradable form\nIt's also very powerful because in the area trades away for smaller businesses and mid sized businesses to more directly raise capital\nAnd I think part of the the benefit is that you can make those assets available through global markets over the Internet and make those available not just to accredited investors but also to main street investors and on accredited investors and\nThat's something that said invest I think really pioneered as a ... cell service model for a supporting offerings to an accredited investors using the JOBS Act framework that's already in place for crowd funding and and different types of securities offerings\nBut you know we're the we're going to get my wife just by the
