I got more with him and not that ... founder and president I'm not that I eat it you know\nThey seem to just as confident the cyber but he also seemed very keen to set the record straight because we've had a few recent stories about didn't lay in his class division twenty thirty cancellations including our own reporting I mean I think some of our uh reporting showed that people calling us long VIP or\nA so he he just wanted to come out and say okay no my plans\nAre on track or if maybe some of some things are happening a bit later a including their own ... among among the many things that he told us\nUm I just wonder was one of those stories that pregnant as consciousness in terms of inviting you in ... and also I care timeline that he explained to us in times up the road to the I. P. or it's probably three the thinking a lot\nSo the way he put it is that in plenty seventeenth I sat down and\nLooked at what ... what do they want to do with their own coat and one of the key decisions they took his that they want a\nCritical downstream as well enter Petro chemicals as and he made them\nLong argument about why Petro chemicals are the future uh for\nSaudi oil exports and\nUh so he's saying okay we're gonna get downstream that means is going to be in competition with somebody that's not going to be good for like a so they're they decide to bring them together to gather to merge them uh this is going to happen next year he said and\nThen you want to one year of full financial results from the merged entity and then end up twenty twenty twenty two are drawn he said they will go ahead with the ideal\nBringing messages eighties so there's this story that the timeline and\nAs those decrying defined also that it says on the idea was to live in poor condition this to the market in Geneva\nI think very important because you have to say is that diversification of Saudi Arabia is also going to take my room ... for me to hold a submarine downstream drive a more diverse five minutes between Cohen saw back I think that makes a great deal of sense\nI think the important point which perhaps people know focused on\nIs a diverse to find a way from Bruce ... oil assets which may be over Fifteen Twenty years my tendon the strength to a very good policy for Saudi Arabia and indeed so old oil exporters what's he saying is I Want to go we're going to be a different animal however\nHer own one year financials was sufficient is highly unlikely here you have a new entity which probably is going to end up being a jerk you wouldn't normally need say fifty years old audited financial before you come to the market\nGoes back to one of the line that you quoted in this story which is talking about setting the bar scene you say that that might be a hesitancy for the market but it's very clear in his conversation which is what I'm going to set the bar high level in terms of what it is that we want to change\nI I think that was probably one of the key questions we wants to Austin ... is the setting the bar high the managing of expectation where there has been a lot of the criticism of him that he has very high expectations and\nReally disappointed maybe some people in terms of the implementation of switch from the beginning people question that this was very ambitious and compassionate country out that he has before because they did a family with two years ago while you're being very ambitious here why not\nGo smaller he asked before made the argument that if I achieve fifty percent when I enter achieve on well\nSo he's he's really pushing as consenting to pushing ahead with this setting the bar high being aggressive and I didn't want to I did wonder actually I mean you've kind of ... of the questions do you think twenty Twenty one is realistic or\n... you know this being pushed back again when I read the interview tomorrow and this is going to be free point do right as opposed to a to point which is so um\nLet's face it what he's saying is his showing leadership and one of Mars and for that so that that is fine I don't see how the ... to\n... to ... pass to we're going to solve the economy towards privatization does the private sector duty playing the role as he wanted to play you of\nMinistries agencies before I can actually go to the phones are three is talking about do you think he has I don't think so I don't think they're prepared a strong leader who has a clear vision I'm\nGoing to be a pattern to state to actually do so this has never happened and so we have to understand them so as an economist surprising that you weren't able to achieve what you propose to achieve what would have very limited periods of time to\nGo back to you in terms of the the two big pieces um that you wrote about one was about his\nContinuing commitment to invest in taking that pay it taken a PIN and investing in stone fine they gone has led they go to the pundits almost doubling I think the title on on the print pace it's doubling dying ...\nHow important was that part of the conversation that even on Wednesday not\nIt was an important part and I think that was also one of the reasons why he decided to come out and make this kind of ... to open up and this broad way\nUm because I think they were question marks of some of the things that were signed with my own house so he's doubling down on the peace and um he's had another forty five billion I have to ask twice I make sure I understood correctly\nUm and and he was he was quite satisfy the thing with a result of the first four to five bedroom where he said you know the results have been great and the first five months he said the return was twenty percent of the non slough here already\nThe first five months he said the return of twenty percent to sort of non flood fear already\nSo he's very happy with a with a result and he wants to end up again I think it's important to understand here that technology is something that he is very keen on here almost obsessive about that he's very he wants to invest in technology he wants to turn it into an electric car\nAn act of rain ...
