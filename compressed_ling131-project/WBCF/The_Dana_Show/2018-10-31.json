C. of radio\n[noise]\n[noise] I played a wing and like hang in San Francisco bay the Bloomberg acknowledging coming out to the next hour for you then and then that we don't let any birth rate in decline\nDive into the third quarter [noise] big hardware overhauling the tech giant revamped it and then I had a friend of mine in here and\nMy little only came along certain quarter earnings are now you mean earnings for the carrier and potential Activision you\nFirst started top story\nFacebook shares fluctuating in late training for reporting third quarter earnings the social network recorded revenue that Wall Street expectations assigned that privacy scandals data breaches another problem continue to take a toll on the company yet Mark Zuckerberg still seems confident and the press release dating quotes\nOur community and they continue to grow quickly and now more than two million people use at least one of our survey said every day we're building that survey test for private messaging and stories and there are huge opportunities ahead and video and commerce to add while\nTheir earnings call in guest starting we will bring you the latest headlines as they come and go and you got to go get earnings report to kind of meeting yelling Bloomberg contributor David Kirkpatrick also with us in Seattle Debra ... Williamson us a marketer David Kirkpatrick corner Facebook already warned us that we're there we're going to be flowing\nWriting hot war thing quite as bad as investors expected\nI think it was pretty much what they predicted which is a reassuring in a sense um I think the question is is it enough which that's a different question entirely [noise] clearly there still capable of being an extraordinarily profitable company but I think we have to really ask\nReally enthusiastic\nEarly profitable company but I think we have to really ask\nReally ... for using Facebook and its other properties continue to grow in developed countries like the United states and Europe\nAnd ... we've got a pretty mixed bag of numbers here revenue ms Walter expectations but as David mentioned profit for better than expected can't break down the numbers for us what were stinky highlight\nFor me I think uh there although the revenue was a mess it wasn't a large miss\nUs so that I always I guess a partial good science\nI think that also we saw um return to a slight amount of growth and monthly active users and the important us and Canada market uh we saw flattened isn't daily active users which is a bit more concerning but at least in the monthly basis we saw growth there\nOn the other hand there was some declines in the European monthly active users again probably due to GDP our fallout so again like you mentioned it's a mixed bag\nI I think it's about as best as good as you might have expected for a company that's been into a lot of turmoil to share\nWhat you were just talking about the user growth with pretty flat for daily activities or growth for a North American month the acting user growth there was actually a blight up kicking gross at what the significance of this is reassuring to investors that things at least are not shrinking\nWell at least on a monthly basis they're not drinking and I think that is important uh\nI I and also on a global basis is important to point out that Facebook has been able to maintain that solid sixty six percent ratio of daily active users to mostly active users something that they've had over the past several quarters\nSo again I manage to eke that out and very you know a quarter after quarter if that number starts to decline I think that's a bigger red flag but overall again I think this is about as good a quarter as you could expect for a company in the position of Facebook's and\nRight and just want to point out as we are going live Mark Zuckerberg has just started thinking on the call thing we have had a stalling quarter but I Want to point out that costs are rising up Ninety percent from the same quarter last year and David what does that mean are they spending still on the content management issue that that's where the Ninety percent increase in mostly coming from\nI'm sure that's the reason it's going up so much faster than it ever has before [noise] I I think the company wants to say simply by spending and hiring but they understand how serious the problems are and they're doing something about it but the proof is in the pudding as we say\nAnd until we see Facebook not having\nThe pernicious effect but it's having on elections and on social dialogue and which is still manifest in all kinds of ways in our country in the United states in Brazil and around the world\nUh I don't think we're going to really be confident that those measures are enough nonetheless it's good they're willing to spend money on it\nI I felt him though for not being willing to talk about it bluntly and maybe on this call soccer bird will be pressed to explain how he feels that how he thinks about the extremely negative role that Facebook has played in certain aspects of modern society which they have never directly confront it but I'm Glad to see them spending money\nAnd I'm sure we'll hear more about this on the call that David mentioned there are these societal concerns that are hanging over their head despite some positive numbers are you seeing brand advertisers holding back at all because of the brands safety security issues we've been talking about\nYou know what we have not seen any holding back on the ... on major advertisers are they're continuing to spend strongly on Facebook a they're spending strongly on Instagram as well uh we're forecasting Instagram will have nine billion dollars in ad revenue to share a mounting to about ... I'm\nTwenty five percent of Facebook's overall ad revenue in the United states\nSo ah an important and growing part and advertisers are still very enamored with Facebook and also with Instagram\nRight it seems like advertisers may be an ... but you are being an ... let's talk a little bit about Instagram which has proven to be more popular and David are they starting to really pull that as a lover of growth here\nWell certainly if the numbers are right than it is if they're making nine billion in revenue from it that's a big big number considering how recently was zero it wasn't that many years ago um\nI I Would like to see the company be more blunt and and disclose what's really happening with their other properties in some detail which they haven't done\nA clearly they have a hedge against whatever happens with Facebook on the other hand in some ways even though it's\nPhoto oriented the architecture of Instagram is very similar to that of Facebook and many of the abuses that are happening on Facebook or also happening on Instagram Instagram has more or less been\nKind of exempt from criticism about it but it's starting that's starting to change we're starting to hear more and more stories\nOf our Instagram to is being abused with for propaganda or hate speech et cetera um but clearly you know they're doing well was Instagram and that is good news for the company that you know\nOtherwise might not have a lot of good news\nRight in in terms of the things other than the court plot for right now in the call you can follow on he lied that could work it's actually talking about what happened improvements they made their and we'll continue this discussion later in the show a marketer principal analyst Debra ... Williamson thank you for joining as always ...

by his growth that eroded by increased competition and the search market and now there's concern on how escalating tensions that the U.S will impact the ad market\nAnd coming out and get it I had a little sense of upgrading twenty Fifteen but will it be enough to reverse falling down to the tablet ...\nIf you'd like Bloomberg News check it out on the radio and you're listening to Bloomberg at

Francisco bay company announced a three hundred million dollar fund raising wound up ... new valuation eight billion dollars\nThat five fold increase our twenty Seventeen valuation putting it well enough companies like black and ... and now according to Bloomberg and now at this point they it expecting to bring in nearly one point three billion dollars in revenue that we're\nDoing is here in San Francisco acquaint they part of the the L O ... and in New York Bloomberg technologies dealing for his age I think so much for joining us pleasure to be here now we mentioned in our story according to you that you didn't need to go out and the ... findings so why did you end up deciding to take such a large amount of capital\nThat's a good question so we we were approached by some very high quality investors earlier this year who have a very constructive thesis on crypto and they they want it to invest in what they what they thought was the best name in the space and so when the GOP Senate presents itself you take it seriously and so we looked at it and even though we didn't need to raise the money we felt it was important\nTo have you know tiger and some of the others in this round as we think they can help us build the next the next phase of of the company with a ...\nWell after by now you said you can't comment on specific rather than if they have launched in ... new products that works for an end to share what air the dining at what\nPoint did he claimed to show how does that impact renting is moving forward is that going to be a big chunk of that\nYeah I think over time each of those businesses we would expect to do to do more than his fair share\nAnd we would expect those businesses to also diversify our revenue streams are revenues currently or a hundred percent trends actual uh the because the business and other businesses are more fee based or a un based and so you'll see is that will grow as part of our overall revenue which which gives us more stability and predictability tour of any strength\nThat a company has been growing dramatically recording profit extending a bit neck on making twenty Nineteen scale should we expect to be an ideal\nThere's not going to be an ideal anytime anytime soon I think we we we have so much to do I mean at some point yes we'll go we'll go public that but that's not that's not even close to the top of the list of things we're worried about right now\nWhen you say so much to do what are the top priority but for right now that's\nHow I think I think for just sort of financial point of view we want to diversify revenue streams as I just talked about that a more predictable revenue right PE of a of an asset manager custodian is much higher than the idea of a broker which is much higher than the of an exchange that we were in all those businesses right so it's just it's a complex\nWhere where ... where a broker an exchange of custodian butter fee structure at the moment is a hundred percent ... and that that will that will more as as time goes first thing\nOne thing that you mentioned earlier this year you launch the index find what do you guys were in front of that that was something that didn't work out as planned as you try to diversify the rather than as strange as you can\nActually I wouldn't say it didn't work out I think what happened is we we we launched the next funding the index then we we went we went with plan a let's call it that which was let's let's bring on institutions let's bring on family offices and in our age and so on and what we found was it was a it was a much bigger hill to climb in terms of the regulatory requirements to do that\nAnd so we think it's actually more efficient\nTo offer it through consumer we we we we rebranded it called the ... bundles is out there now is a one click almost a robo adviser type product it's available to our consumers it's available to institutions that they want it that way it's a much simpler and faster way of deploying the same the same thing\nAnd so we it's it's literally a push too hard given the regulatory environment this past is much easier and actually creates more value for the customer so that's why that's why we did that I\nNow by some estimates the number of us use are trading on the climate pot from had fallen roughly eighty percent since the peak of ... so what are you seeing amongst your client base does trading lion activity\nShort so so volume volume is gonna is going to move in line with work with their prices are right so that that's that's true of every exchange every broker [noise] we we actually find that a number of engaged active users to people who are coming inside the chicken prices et cetera that continues to increase we continue to gain gain customers every every month and every day which were which were proud of\nThe the the focus at the moment is on broadening out the base of products we offer and also accelerating what we think is the next phase of crypto which is the utility face so every every technology to go through an investment phase and utility phase where the investment phase right now\nBut our mission is to create a more open financial system for the world and and in doing that we're we're driving things like this table we just announced our wallet product we think these can fundamentally benefit people who are currently on bank represented throughout the world to me that in the u._s. or somewhere else\nAnd you've talked to that point adding more access to the platform recently five in particular report and what's the timing around that\nBut you should expect us to you know there there are look there you know somewhere between two and three thousand kept a currency is out there let's assume that you know Ninety percent of them are garbage that still means at ten percent there's somewhere between two and three hundred that are ... worth investing in legitimate worth worth taking part in we offer seven\nAnd so you should expect us to go from seven to that total number that we think is worth it over the next call a year or so we will add those were going to add them geography by geography because the U.S frankly has not kept pace with where regulation is it throughout the world and so some things will be offered in the ocean\nUs frankly has not kept pace with where regulation is throughout the world and so some things will be offered in the U.S but the more things were hardly offered outside the U. S. but over the next year you should expect us to to offer most of those that are that are worthy of big offered\nDemand look like 'cause when you guys launched at a quaint climax was around but crypto was falling in value and I just love it and now you know are there is there a lot of demand out there in the retail demand has pulled back but I Wonder what Wall Street and other it'll hedge funds are thinking about that say\nLook we we we we get more and more demand from from traditional Wall Street and from and from what you know institutions every day so so\nThe the biggest impediment for most of them is they need a custodian right they they they need a qualified custodian that can safely store crypto we've we've been doing it for longer than anybody else we store more of it than anybody else we have to the track record in the industry which is why they came to us last year and said can you become a qualified custodians so we can participate in this market place\nAnd so that's why we're very proud the logical and discuss the that that's the that's the\nThat's a prerequisite if you will\nAnd then we've we've got a suite of institutional products that that that we offer for those institutions and that's that's where they are on boarding and there's a lot of coffee shops that are already trading quit though you know ... there was no different than any other us that they trade in the sense that it throws up data eggs also they can mind um long short funds are starting to trade it too I think the you know the lowly guys are going to be later\nCertainly there are big parts of Wall Street that are already trading crypto today\nAway quaint vice president and CEO at the ... and Bloomberg Technology ... thank you both for joining thank you for asking\nComing up we continue to bring you the latest that affects the burning call Sheryl Sandberg on the call Jeff now illustrating how they're bringing adventure messaging which is a very important avenue growth going forward of shared continuing to fall now down nearly ... percent in after hours trading will stay on the headline that says Bloomberg [noise]\n[noise] that is a collection of authoritative influential and promoted you'd voices on the finance and economics politics internationally than\nCulture and vote and they like noisy well the views of nights Larry the antigens commentary that reaches you wherever and whenever you need it on the radio on the ...

more than Eighteen and cheese horizons sprints Comcast and charters combined so that was a big quarter and we're excited about it\nNow last year the mobile ... three TV to jump into the online TV survey can you give us some insight into how development has been what the tiny will be like\nAbsolutely were busily building TV for the five gee era\nAnd that's important because with the new T Mobile we will have an ability\nTo bring broadband service to fifty two percent of us ZIP codes through five gee that's amazing because you know broadband is the most competitive market out there half of broadband customers out there had no choice at all they have one or less options that's crazy and twenty Eighteen\nSo we're going after it in the new T Mobile and in order to do that we're going to need a TV service that it frees customers from wires forever freeze them from any particular cable box\nAnd allows them to experience high definition in a way they never could before in a way that has met\nTheir phones their social media life and ... and has it all integrated in a contemporary packets so we're busy building that the journey starts later this year and it'll continue over the next

completely different than anything a TNT or ... and are doing which is our six hundred megahertz low band spectrum will be supported and phones for five do you know this is important because the other guys are doing five gee in certain parts of certain cities\nUh our view is it five gee is so transformational ought to be for everyone literally every one nationwide and only T Mobile is pursuing a strategy of true nationwide five gee using our low band spectrum and we're going to be national by twenty twenty so it's coming faster than most people think\nAnd like what's the latest on the proposed a regulatory ready for the merger with friends I mean there were read the report that the New York attorney general's office is backing up the probe over concerns that it could lead to price hikes on the cheaper prepaid phone\nThat's entirely expected you know our view um is that it's going really well and we expected both\nExpected you know our view is that it's going really well and we expected both the federal government and the state governments to take a close look at this and they need to and the closer they look at it the better it is for us because\nYou know we've submitted twenty five million pages of documents and salads and pages of economists tricks to support a pretty simple proposition\nThat the synergy of this merger are so profound that they're going to allow us to create an unprecedented network\nWas capacity that is on a level of Americans have never seen before and prices and competition are a function of capacity more capacity means lower prices so the more the state governments or the federal government dig into the details as was reported they're doing the better it is for our case so were gratified that they're taking a close fact\nBased database looking where respectfully participating in the process\nAnd I want to dig a little deeper into what you just said I how exactly will ... is the number of carrier strengths to three just walking quickly through how exactly that worked\nWell in a typical situation when you see mergers and an industry what what drives up prices is the elimination of capacity in that industry eliminating a competitor means eliminating all their factors of production\nThis mergers the exact opposite what's going to happen is the two combined companies will have a capacity that is eight times higher than the combination of standalone sprint and T Mobile\nIt's an explosion of network capacity what's that do it gives us every economic incentive to use the capacity to bring more competition and lower prices to take customers for ... and so every American's going to benefit here post paid prepaid and whether or not there with the new team mobile customers over at age ... or benefit too because\nYou
