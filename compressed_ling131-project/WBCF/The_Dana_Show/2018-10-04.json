talk about these rapidly evolving have and also with us here on the ... of course the Amazon and his base here so I don't want to start with you because you know what you're seeing the market turns in Seattle that in some ways for what you're seeing\nMore broadly talks about how the ... same here is related to the real estate theme large\nWorlds hurts Moore up this town over the past five years

for people looking for a better life and on\nOur people are leaving\nTheir coming yeah we still have plenty\nBut in the story of started the pile up and some folks have said\nImpact on Amazon on Seattle for better or worse\nWell it's been an overwhelmingly positive impact I mean every\nCity in America\nIs vying for H. cue to created this massive amount of prosperity and all of these jobs created an entire tech ecosystem\nWe're having the same challenge the San Francisco did trying to deal with the prosperity and making sure that it is well divided among all the citizens because this used to be a logging town in a coffee town and the north shore the Cosco town it used to be middle class town and now and it's a total texting\nPer se I don't mean entertaining fixing to have jobs not\nWell I think they're going to be hiring hair as fast as they can to their buildings going up less than right\nIt's just that they had all of their eggs in one basket and tension started to bill

so they made a big headlines yesterday with the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage play tricks warehouse workers has a very savvy move for Amazon because it basically you know jumps from being this\nPoster boy for wealth and equity\nTo being a leader of the Fifteen dollar an hour and living wage movement but then a footnote on that is that there were some compensation programs that they're eliminating show one is a stock options that warehouse workers will\nSee phased out over the next couple of years and the other are some incentive bonuses based on how much time off you take in and and some ... production of bonuses as well as those will be eliminated so some things are being taken away and the bottom line is that the the Fifteen dollar an hour announcement is very good for\nA new workers at Amazon there there are those are the ones who will see the starting wage go up the most and then people who have been in the warehouse was a few years or ... won't be as big of a bump those still see a bump but not as big as\nAs big of a bump into some of them are a little a little a frustrated by all the publicity around\nSt political implications are an Amazon setting the minimum wage as opposed to the federal government\nI think that the minimum wage for Amazon to the issue is that for all competing for power with people who are driving for Hoover so if you're trying to pay twelve dollars an hour Walmart workers are walking out of the store and driving a car instead so I think some of the soil is\nCeding ground for Bernie Sanders and everyone else and some of the the

of Amazon being\nIn in the D.C region would be that it's become so large and there's so much of an antitrust conversation going around it\nA lot of people within Amazon feel like the the biggest weakness or a threat to Amazon has just misunderstanding around Amazon joke you suddenly had that proximity and [noise] you know you can definitely of angel eyes from from from the nation's capital and potentially toward some of those concerns\nMe for you don't have to ask about the broader real estate market we're seeing signs of a slowdown beginning prolonging it out and that's how I Can't

as\nFeet and where do you feel that address\nReally what you spoke about are really our understanding of the enterprise and things like\nBuilding hybrid and really from the very beginning of the guys are making understanding that technology will run across data centers across the ... and in the public cloud and building that from the very beginning to think it's about our partnership with your customers like Volkswagen Coca Cola Chevron were really partnering deeply with them\nHelping them with their transformation not just being a technology render a cloud vendor for them I think those are really important reason cuts worth accusing as her\nTake to win big partner like that though when Amazon market leader and\nI'm sure your customer came on Amazon is more experience had more\nTime and it certainly Amazon been around longer\nUm but it's they they have much more of a technology provider approach where we go in and talk to them a customer's indeed with them in a long term strategy of it doesn't just about selling them technology are getting them to use our cloud but actually changing your business what does it look like to have\nA kind of the car platform what does it mean to you the AI for shell and finding better a drilling process so it's a much more of a partnership on them business by not just the technology is can we have so much history and working with enterprise customer for forty years have a different point of view that we can bring so customer engagement\nIt's been widely reported that Amazon his favorite for the big contract with the Pentagon and are you concerned that Microsoft\nYou know what we're doing everything we have to bring to that and I think we have um a great case and also you know great partnership and technology with the government as well so I feel great about you and making the case to the defense\nCertainly engaged inappropriate ways uh on the bed and you know can certainly working with the the day the area on that\nGoes on and Google have certainly progress\nOver the years and a number three are you seeing more competition from Google is more of a threat and it was like they have to go\nYou know I don't I don't see them a lot in our customer engagement little to be honest I think you know Amazon certainly had the the first to market leadership position but I don't I don't see the other vendors coming up very much in\nPie isn't just you know it's not like they're dominating for a finite I write expanding right and what do you see that high looking like in let's say five years now get written isn't looking tighter than it does today\nYeah you know I'm Glad you said that because so many people are about competing and I'm like the pies so big and\nIt's almost like an unlimited total opportunity it took about four trillion dollars if you took what is being run technology on Christmas Day and we're going to the cloud and so\nI'm not so worried about you know the other competition versus what are we doing with customers to kind of take advantage of that and really help them embrace that so it is an interesting time in this moment with the technology of having effectively no a threshold and for the for growth\nKind of technology companies have found themselves in tricare political situations have laid there was a big protest\nMy contract that you had\nUs immigration and the middle of the family separation policy\nKnowing how to how the technology is going to be used and whether or not to\nTechnology to an arm of the U.S government yeah\nThey kind of goes back to the fundamental principles around trust and kind of belief around privacy is a human rights in those areas and so\nAs we provide technology making sure that we're putting in place or the right to charities or doing things within the criminal law and I'm waiting to compliance requirements and really making sure that the information around privacy is really in the customers' hands and that they're all the kind of ... around that are appropriately\nHow does that mean it doesn't matter to you how the technology is going to be is\nAnd we certainly one of the technology used for good\nOur one of my principal and we spent a lot of time around a I've ethics and for good and very much our probes that we have from the beginning is that in a moment of humans and using it in those ways certainly\nIs that in a moment of human and using it in those ways certainly that is our investment that we're focusing on that were engaged with that technology and they have responsible about it\nAnd it's also as much of our our part in playing with the industry about how we say is moving forward and we were really super important we do our part to also bring the industry together on this Microsoft have found evidence that\nGroups affiliated with the Russian government are already trying to hack the election we've been covering the baseball cap the largest in its history it says the challenge for for a cloud company right or our companies in the cloud really equipped to handle these kinds of security issues yeah when they have such\nA major major consequences including potentially threatening are\nGreat I mean one of the reason I'm Still passionate about cloud with our customers is because we actually\nAre best to set up to deal with this type of ... billion dollars a year on cyber security across our cloud we've already five hundred security engineered that's all they do that is their life blood\nAnd for there to any organization even a large commercial well funded organization doesn't have that kind of resource to be able to keep up with the threats if not people in basically trying to embarrass executives anymore disease nation states rats and so that's why we invest a lot but we do that's
