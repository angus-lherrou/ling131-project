S. buddy in Silicon valley you know a softbank and by extension the Saudis have become kind of this funder of last resort\nFor these being late stage a privately held tech companies that are trying to you know put off and I appeal for a couple of years so if\nIf the Saudi money um goes away of companies feel like they can't take money from softbank or from Saudi Arabia that could kind of put her whole ranch in the entire I'm a sort of venture capital market uh in Silicon valley\nSeveral leaders have come up to the Saudi Government also 'cause he kept to softbank not the least of which is over which in which shopping is now a huge investor um\nA bird which in which softbank is now a huge investor um several leaders business leaders have dropped out of an upcoming summit Davos in the desert one of them is ... ... ... he on complicated because I think is one of their backers\nA darn thing I'm very troubled by the reports about a ... ... we are following the situation closely and I'm laughing substantially different set of facts\nEmerges I won't be attending a conference in Riyadh Eric not missing words there and hard to back down from that statement\nYeah this is a very thorny situation for Uber because you know sure there's ... soul searching about what to do about solving money but ... taken three point five billion dollars\nOr from the Saudis and has a representative on their board so the decision to walk away from this conference in pretty early\nSort of before some in the big names had started to pull out was a tough decision for Daraa but I think there was a calculation that you know this is a consumer company that obviously had a terrible\nYear last year for making sort of questionable decisions and so they needed to move quickly and take a stand\nMeantime ah several business leaders have dropped out or dropped off the board that was supposed to be helping the Saudi Government I developed this future city and we haven't max if I'm correct heard anything yet from softbank\nNo and and and he said the the the stock price plummeted a ... a ... earlier today and um and and you know it's basically just a situation where softbank is so messed\nWith the Saudis that this could be very it can be very hard for them to untangle the situation so that they didn't find it a hundred million hundred billion dollars\nForty five billion dollars of that is money from Saudi Arabia and this plan for sex vision for uncalled for another forty five a billion dollars to another twenty five coming from sock thanks so so really it's it's the biggest\nChunk of this fun so it's hard to see how you can go how um Moscow song can go through with his plans if there isn't some kind of\nA you know or some some kind of story emerges that makes people feel more comfortable doing business with Saudi Arabia\nEric you also have a major Saudi ally coddling for a boycott of Hoover and what's the latest there\nYou know it's never sort of rivers always under fire a you know I think a boycott sort of at this point I'm you know ... to see I think I think it's hard to say now max\nLet's talk about some of the other business relationships at stake here the Saudis having wealth and also has a huge shake and tests as we've been talking about a ... over the last several weeks and ... the the entertainment company is in the process of severing ties with\nA ... the Saudis while fund a they had a fourteen million force excuse me four hundred million dollar deal um that is\nAt stake you know how we expect this to continue to unfold\nYou got to think that you on most of feels like he dodged a bullet by not you know they're securing funding as he brags with a Saudi Arabian because because while they would just be yet another crisis for for Tesla and instead they just have to deal with sort of a depressed stock price\nSo so yeah I mean it's it's it's a it's a situation where you are a few months back um Mohammed bin ... saw him on was you know sort of going all over the u._s. so you know having you know dates with ... and and you know many other tech moguls\nUm and and it just feels like this whole uh there's

Google ... die angry and also just dropped out of this ... dollars in the desert if he well\nConference you know the U.S government also has a you know ... a very closely watched relationship with the Saudi Government if President Trump has said that U.S officials are looking into this you know how could how the U.S weighs in on this impact all of these other relationships\nSo one thing that I think it's interesting you mentioned the possible boycotted over one thing that's happened to these two to basically every kind of companies everything's becoming politicized and we saw you know earlier today President Trump a kind of you know ducking some questions are seeming to to the fed and Saudi Arabia to some extent\nAnd you could imagine a situation where any tech company that is taking money\nFrom Saudi Arabia or an edge the connective Saudi Arabia could get wrapped into the same kind of politicization including boycotts hash tag campaigns um or what not that we saw really hurt over last year you can see that spilling over to to other companies\nHow big is it worth business in the middle east and the ... and a business that could potentially be affected as a result of
