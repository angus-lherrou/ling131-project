marks China\nThey've got very very near you kind of have to know when\nTo hang on and it was like ... and it wasn't\nWay and the company is on track to raise profitability sending shares a story line hang\nFor a new and it has any other major U.S telecommunications company is the latest caught up in a China computer hacker avail Bible him but they like the guy made us got rather than anything related hardware for the super ... camera\nI Want to bring in our little ... executive editor for formal technology tongue child quite on the science tells us ally thing about this new reporting\nWhat shows is that the supply chain remains under threat there that the Chinese do have ways of getting at\nThe components to end up in our data centers high end us data centers I'm In this instance researchers working on behalf of his telecom company\nFound if it's if it's a slightly different type of manipulation but again hardware was manipulated hardware that originated in China\nThat made its way in the U.S you know in the U.S supply chain um had been manipulated addicts addicts for instance in China um and and and it was found out and it's been removed\nFrom what it what does it indicates that uh you know again ... do remain remain vulnerable\nResearcher who has come forward right in the story I Try to have our\nOwning his reputation on the line here he's talked about what they found what\nWhen they you know kind of how they reached the conclusion that they came to we've seen in the documents we've run them by other people who do security who wonder you know I understand\nAnd we've seen the documents we run them by other people who do security you wonder if you understand how this works and they have\nIndicated to us his approach makes sense\nWhat was different in terms of how this hardware was compromise front of the previous report\nSome previously this is this has to do with the ether no connection so and this is what we use to connect telecommunications network\nUm that was different in this case um but what's what similar is its supply chain originated in China and it has to do with hardware and and super micro once again is the company at the heart now in his and you know you see instance apple bonds the researcher he's a super microbes as a victim\nHere and he says that super microbes not the only one that is used as a conduit so we're definitely pursuing all of those angles super\nMicrobes continues to deny correct even this latest story of that saying that security of our customers and the integrity of our products are cordial and it is and our company values we take care to secure the integrity of our products throughout the manufacturing process and supply chain security is an important topic of discussion\nFor our industry we had no knowledge of any unauthorized components and I'm not\nAn informed by any customer that such components\nFound on apple and Amazon containing tonight the original story had he was a new government officials weighing in and saying there's no reason to doubt that company what the outside right how do we square companies\nHave talked about their involvement right they said that we didn't discover these chips are networks so again we have to weigh that against what we've been told by a multitude of sources Seventeen\nUnnamed sources and now right and Eighteenth\nNames right although he's not talking directly about Amazon and apple to be clear um they have stuck to their denials and they're very they're very detailed them we take them very seriously um do you judge has come out um\nWe're also as we've said nor stories were not as it's possible that they weren't that they aren't involved but they don't have oversight over those uh those agencies that are involved in in in the investigation that we've talked about and we've written about\nWhy am I the telecom industry has been targeted in what could the consequences of that\nThe well I mean the ... you know as the\nVillain communications industry and so you know if this is where these are the networks over which can all of our communications arm ... our email or phone calls\nAre traveling so it wouldn't seem to me I'm a logical target of someone who wanted to understand communications you know sensitive communications and or or\nYou know wanted to eavesdrop on on IP were not clear exactly what the intent was here a little bit less clear than we were before which was\nVery much a pie and whatever sensitive communications that were traveling over networks less clear he's in this instance what the motivation would have been but again it's you know if the telecommunications network so I'm pretty central to uh\nAll the communication that were that are traveling over an hour\nRight well I Know you and your came I can hang up a point out that story we are saying tuned for any developments lower\nTax on child thanks so much we know that ... has been a super Michael customer but has found no evidence to suggest that Bloomberg has been affected by the hardware ...\nHad a new report by the cybersecurity firm crowds strike reveals China has the largest cyber threat over the last six months it coming from Fort reveals Chinese adversaries has made targeted and persistent insured and accounts and multiple sectors of the economy from biotech and\nTo pharma and transportation I thought the crowds ... chief technology officer Dimitri a pair of H. and asked him about both\nTo the line from airport really is that China's back\nWhen you look at the last couple of years we actually saw precipitous decline in Chinese nation state sponsored intruder activity against the commercial sector in two thousand sixteen right after the Obama administration struck that agreement with brother she that both countries would stop conducting industrial espionage against each other and\nUh the the Chinese largely by by that agreement for for the time um but then last year and a half we started to see pick up an activity and now we're just seeing a lot of intrusion in all sectors of the economy whether it's\nA biotech pharmaceutical high tech professional services hospitality insurance mining\nAll types of sectors where the Chinese are breaking in\nAnd stealing intellectual property and now as opposed to before it's mostly the ministry of state security there um civilian intelligence on that's doing most of this activity versus people Liberation Army the military um that was doing a lot of that activity before two dollars and Fifteen\nNow will tell us an extensive investigation that found that the Chinese and planting spy kept on the mother born of super micro servers that then\nUp at seven thirty companies and the u._k. and he laughed\nGovernments reaction to this report we also got a news story out today that the situation was found to us telecom\nSupply chain has always been a concern and we're actually seeing China and Russia and others leveraging that software supply chain and their tax where they're compromising software\nAnd leveraging the updates for that software it's actually introduced malicious code and to environments we haven't personally seen any hardware base attacks like the ones with those stories are talking about um there's something about Harlow forces physical someone actually physically look at it\nAnd where are our fire whether there was an implant on those systems are not so I think there's a lot more to learn a skill as those stories unfold and\nI I had mentioned that the companies involved has denied their ... and and US government officials have said there's no reason to doubt that denial but that that\nWould say within the scope of something that the Chinese are capable\nIt is certainly possible that the ...\nLike a very expensive and a very difficult effort to go through to to achieve that objective knowing of course that they're able to do the ... the compromise of software supply chains or just direct intrusions into companies like what we're seeing now so it's out of the realm of possibilities but I think there's still a lot of questions to answer here\nKill reporting what you most concerned about you talk about the relationship between nations saints government arms and their criminal counterpart twin in this nation states and that you're continuing to see a blurring the lines\nThat's why we're seeing increasingly criminal groups adopting nation state techniques nation state tool and tradecraft in order to break into organizations\nSo increasingly as a nation states are coming up with a lot of the innovation a lot of the new um exploits and discover new vulnerability is very very quickly than dissipate into the criminal underground and those criminals are now using those\nTechniques to break into companies\nBiggest threat to companies of course is destructive attacks like uh the WannaCry attacks and not by the attacks we have seen\nA from North Korea and Russia respectively in the last year and those types of attacks can take down organizations for weeks at a time we worked on a number of cases are around those attacks last year and companies have suffered literally tens of millions of dollars some some hundreds of millions of dollars in damage because of them\nThe new security chat a\nCaptive designed by Google called\nOf course there are

security into our phone hardware of our phones have control of our of our phones that are other products\nAnd um and so those are some of the things that we're doing\nWe're not seeing much of an actual reality in these products so I Know that this is something that Google has been working on how well virtual reality and augmented reality fit in to this product ...\nActually really excited
