subscribers twentieth out from ... ... email Andrea ... to rent an audience measurement and data management platform networks over the top it goes to stand for hunting from LA blue I focused shot convert the company for a look at\nThe highlight here obviously is the primary far and away speeding ethnic also have four\nSubscribers being at meeting estimates put the\nYeah I mean the thing with Netflix is that the investors always look at the subscriber number it doesn't seem to matter what's happening with the revenue or their earnings by and large the ... the revenue story for Netflix has been one that's pretty positive\nOr because they're boosting the amount of revenue that they get per subscriber which means that each subscribers they sign up shouldn't be a kind of a positive for them\nBut the take away a as always is a subscriber number there on pace to add almost twenty nine million customers this year I went into this quarter thinking it was possible that they would report I decline and subscribers this year if they had a mist instead\nThey're going to post their biggest there ever a by about five million you at a certain point you run out of ... it's the talk about the growth at least in terms of customers the company's delivering\nWhen you look at the data across traffic what do you believe is driving this new\nAnd look at the data across traffic what do you believe is driving this new Netflix Original shows\nYou know I I don't believe it's than your Netflix Original content at all um I I I think there's a certain you know part of the the success of Netflix that can be attributed now it definitely over the last quarter suggest a rising tide you know floats all boats\nSo growth that we're seeing across over the top and connected TV not just domestically in the u._s. but pretty much every broadband Internet connected\nIn a market in the world is is just phenomenal and you know I think at some point you know the the street has to stop looking at Netflix from the standpoint of just did they hit or miss or their own ... uh you know I'm\nA estimates in terms of what a growth is going to be in really just look at it as a normal company or I think there's three things that I Would be really worried about in terms of the future if I was Netflix regardless of really whatever the the story was this quarter\nAnd that would be you know a TNT Disney and then ... the solutions um you know the the the value and the demand for the content\nThat that HBO and the warning media will have one name on law when they launched their solutions Disney content and then just a massive growth to free ad supported OTC or even more significant I think than than than what we're seeing from that for the last few quarters\nLike say so far I had a other streaming provider at this point do you share those concerns and it's about Eighteen ... is an ... and other free over the ...\nI think the free one is not really a concern for Netflix you know they competed for the last ten years with a pretty popular free of sport a service called YouTube and both companies have done just fine over that period\nThe competition from from Disney information he is very real those two companies have huge trove of library is very popular there both can be pulling back movies and TV shows from Netflix to boost their own services\nYou know the the Netflix counter wouldn't be the one that they've been building a studio over the past few years or something they talk about and a letter to shareholders today and their biggest hit as an original show stranger things or something that they made themselves that's not something they got from another studio\nAnd then to Andres on point about sort of a rising tide I think you can see AT and T. and Disney grow without necessarily hurting Netflix you know there'll be a lot of competition in the developed western markets\nThe ... but I think overseas in particular Netflix is going to be really far ahead of those companies and I don't know how much of a threat they'll be in a place like Brazil\nLooking at a chart right now in the top live blah we're following Netflix results and this is a chart of Netflix margins which appear to be very strong Andre\nA result of the original content investments are those investments in Iran all content worth it because\nIt's like a warning about its negative free cash flow and it has a note in its in its results today to investors that they recognize they're making huge investments in content that they believe that investment is worth it and we'll have over the long term but\nFrom the payment Netflix's is very intelligent and they saw you know caused the economies of scale changing three or four years ago when they really started to make their investment\nSo you know Netflix knows they have no technological barriers to entry so at some point with the just the proliferation of protein connected TV uh the providers of content that they rely on would eventually bring that in the house and that's really why they've been preparing this\nOriginal content strategy for quite some time would um so what I Will disagree on though is you know looking at YouTube which was the overwhelming majority of the content is user generated as competition is is really\nYou know not viable now what you're seeing across free ads supporting solutions whether it's you know food on TV or to be TV is high quality professional cruise content license from the ... and the Sony's and the Warner Brothers and others\nAnd and that's where domestically in the U.S the majority of the unique also growth has been over the last twenty months or so and then an international market is really not so much having to worry about\nThat Disney's or the Eighteenth team that it's the global TVs in Brazil that that on all the popular told a villa writes the eyes leaks in India and and Netflix has had problems competing in these markets um and so my concern is in order to compete on on a hundred different fronts at once\nAnd having you know original content in the native languages and different genres the amount of money that Netflix is going to have to spend on content over the next few years is just\nIt's so unprecedented that I I Would be concerned if I if I were Netflix\nRight and international is where the crowd is coming from right now but can I keep on drinks wants to ensure uptick CEO and look a shot on news thanks I'm like look I was listening into the call happening momentarily\nStaying with our new shares of IBM and dropped it after market

know the the company goes through through through the use of Maine print print refreshed cycle and that the anniversaries so would you would see the growth to come down a little bit\nBut there's a particular division ... conger to solutions and that's when we saw some growth go down to I think it was negative five percent and constant currency\nAre under positive side of the division ... business services done grew about two percent but I think it's that ... percent decline in cognitive that is in our view a little bit alarming because that's where a lot of the walks and related technologies sit\nAnd we would want to know one to call as to what was the reason why we saw such a decline in that particular segment so let's talk\nAbout the cloud weekly I continue to unveil new cloud products but thank God for the call revolution a lake can catch up\nTo the you know what to do is to look at it one is the public health delusions which was on his own Web services so Microsoft I showed her own Lewis toes is\nWhat I mean wants to do was Martin I order clients that out usually on premise or you know mostly on premise and they want to move their applications and data to the cloud um that's more of a hybrid cars strategy and you know the ... but the problem is those companies take a long time to move\nTheir portfolios to the cloud and also in Studio we think Microsoft doesn't enjoy what oh there was because it has somebody that has a very strong public on presidents and insult to present in the enterprise\nShares still struggling over time you know you know and I
