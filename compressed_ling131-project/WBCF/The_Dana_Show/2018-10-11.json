[noise]\nSorry sorry top story and Broadcom has said a memo reporting to be signed by the U.S department of defense circulating among members of Congress calling for a possible run of the company's acquisition of the technologies\nOf the products out of the technology they're found in defense finance and energy industries the Pentagon is also say in the mental circulating is likely a fraudulent documents so where did this mental gotten from for details going by what am I at ... in New York So Adam what are we learning about that [noise]\nOr events of farming and said yes as you say vis a minute he's probably of fraud they come home to come out very quickly and so they seem to some problems with single since early a southern girl to what it looks like and it does some inconsistencies in the book was referring to was broken limited\nAlways you know the name of the companies will come in a sort of the day on as always so so if he's a real memo which we don't think it is that wants to do this kind of a historic at this point um and then there was some of those where there were some misspellings and tons of senators names and the um which was fan\nIs funny strange if there's anything goes through I don't know if he's going to come out and also also deny the ah for us to\n... Senator Rand Paul has come out saying this deal is a security risk it should be subject to national security reveal that as a result of this memo and comments still stand\n[noise] that's really interesting\nYeah with that as a result of this memo and that that comment still stand\n[noise] that's really interesting and that's going to be a big question going forward he saw some stuff\nFrom this memo in those comments I think he talks about twenty nine nuclear reactors in which the technologies is imbedded um duck comes directly from this from as far as I can tell when there's potentially wrong I'm broke on me to come to me that we know is is some things if he says look very closely out in the past they blow them from getting a call ... because they said even though then\nThey would technically a sort of a single pulled on the phone company but largely a U.S base when they said we don't trust and we don't think they're going to be good actors here\nDo they do the same on Syria it will remain to be seen whether or not they even have the jurisdictions do it because if it's over the country really look good deals where the Cora\nIs coming from outside the U. S. citizen I think it's important to note if he was very recently just got new powers um they've been given a Boulder Monday in terms of what they can actually regulate regards us feels in one of those things is look any company that has\nInterstate commerce within the u._s. overseas will come and see both full squarely into that somebody might take a look at this and they may um indeed decide that this has to do what they want to do want to go through bowl we do know for now at least according to the ... going to have an offer any such would be\nTo you know he he wrote a piece a couple of weeks ago about how arrive and nationalism and certainly some of the policies of the Trump Administration is\nSapping deal flow we'll one do we expect they failed to move forward and to do we expect other deals not to happen as a result of these policies\nAnd the second part and I was very easy I think yes we expect other they will not happen as a result of these policies I think particularly any do inbound into the U.S uh especially when it involves anything related to ... structure which is a bit of a moving speech because oversee that can can change depending on what the administration defined as between church and the thing\nThe tech particularly when I'm semi conductor space I think that's just the nose of foreign cars right now\nDoes this deal goes through look I think most people come and study confident it does the spread\nWas not a huge um I think we will come in now where U.S companies are they still have hooked on who you know there have been there's been some noise around him and whether or not sort of business if you're comfortable with him as an owner but that said based on a lot of bills in the U.S who have gone through previously the only one that they've been bought some\nWas Qualcomm which is a is a different kind of deal would also be able to find that you're dead was significantly different that would be taking out essentially\nYou know the largest single player in the U.S in this in this area so we can do so I think there's a very good show they steal does go through that said more broadly we are looking at a much tougher regulations environment for up for any for in a car coming the U.S and indeed any foreign acquired going into Europe ... for them on a China\nRight the Qualcomm takeover would have been the biggest ... takeover and history at the White House shut that down at him and I know you continue to follow the story they try to find out where that came from a clear if that happened in New York Thank you so much\nWhile I'm living on his ... shopping continues to plow billions of dollars into well and if you're talking about everything\nMan time the target is once again the co working started out we work now stopping fishing find is that you want a controlling stake in we work which means that the new financing can total anywhere between Fifteen to twenty billion dollars this according to the wall Street Journal\nShopping already has a four point four million dollar steak and we work and she said that indicated he's not satisfied with just one\nMan and find even though it's already got major investments and companies like ooh we're arm in video and more he plans to launch a new one hundred billion dollar fun every few years after this guy's got David ... Patrick calling me editor in chief and Bloomberg sonic\nWho covers it at your capital scene and Sarah you recently interviewed Matteo she's done he told you about it and it's just plans for multiple fine and you make of this new we worked ...\nWell it says ten went to his plans to deploy a hundred billion dollars every two to three years that's a lot of cash so\nThe size of that we work investment being discussed would fit right in with that works for we work which is doing this big expansion and to Asia and other areas the one missing piece is will it pay off\nWell and that's a question that David and we were was reportedly thinking thirty five billion dollar evaluation this would be much less still losing hundreds of millions of dollars and you have to prove it the revenue that it's bringing it to the table and if it will continue to grow at its current pace is this going\nMight not be a good but for some people but you know both we work and so softbank a vision fund or shoot the moon operation so we work as a shoot the moon company and the software and rent or fund or bring some fun is they shoot the moon investor and they're basically both willing to make humongous bugs and they're sort of\nEnabling one another or I mean obviously if we were does raise another ten billion plus from softbank that allows them\nTo do a whole lot more and then you know it begins to be possibly is so fulfilling prophecy that aren't making any money they're far from making money but if they can expand will fast enough and maybe then go public\nUh maybe when the markets remain frothy as they basically continue to be in the public sphere you know maybe ... and get their money back and it'll all be great even if we were done in the long term become the only place we all work by the way I work in a way to work so we were\nHere they have good drinks on David\nMy son had been very clear he thinks it is a big opportunity and that they're not going to lose\nMoney on a visit to find in general take a listen to what he had to say\nThe regional harmed law division ... deal because the preparation for God given an opportunity similar to the gold rush or a quota approach and the smoke would accept the money from partners to avoid the building ...\nAnd we're sure the fund will be a success and we should be thinking big for this lifetime business opportunity\nOur investors innovation fund expecting\nI mean are they thinking to access to find that could mean a typical venture capital fine if it does a good job of it it's closer to ...\nRight so last year the boss said that the visions and had already returned\nIn excess of twenty percent which is you know most\nAre definitely operating at a loss for their first two years of existence that says barely a year and he said his personal rate of return\nTwo thousand has been over forty percent annually so I mean the\nKen I'm whether it's been since Ninety nine or Ninety eight before the big dot com run up and crash but still that's very impressive over the past Eighteen years so investors are hoping some of that personal magic he's had will rub off on divisions son\nPrepared to make these big bold said even if the bulk of them don't work out he thinks he's going to have one or two that knock it out of the park just as he did with a Yahoo\nAli Baba it almost became a relevant that he had dozens more investments that went nowhere and so because of that track record investors are\nHow you came care conclusion that they said by and ... in the face of you know a staunch opposition from the bears I just mentioned you know and an earlier analyst who believe actually cashiers are going to go in the opposite direction\nSo my big call here really is that we're taking an angle of looking at the sector really from a disruptive perspective and from a technology angle which I've covered for the past Twenty years\nAnd a lot of people will talk about electric an autonomous is really kind of being the disruptor as we look at it as really kind of the enablers and I think this was going to enable a platform ecosystem\nSo think about developers building applications directly on top of the car and turn that car into an application so you download something you press a button and then you turn that vehicle into a ride sharing vehicle or you download a different up and turn it into a delivery vehicle and ultimately the reason why we're so Bush on Tesla\nIs because if you actually look at the commercial technology that's already built into the car a lot of those platform ecosystem um technology is already there and that's what makes us really positive on the long term story for for Tesla\nNow we know that production numbers over the last several weeks have looked good what we don't know if it Catholic can't sustain that level of production over the next few weeks are optimistic Harry ... a production numbers will look good you believe half will reach profitability but what how to happen in order for that to happen in your view\n[noise] so you're absolutely right our outperform is definitely predicated on the near term and them being able to generate cash we've done a lot of work around zero emission vehicle credits\nAnd we think in the back half of this year they can generate somewhere in the neighborhood of around five hundred million dollars\nI remember there was no costs associated with this so this is going to be pure cash flow which I think helps in addition to the free casual generations I think they'll get going to the third and into the fourth quarter\nAnd then I also think that they have some uh unused debt commitments that they can also tap which will be more than enough to cover the debt commitments that are coming up over the next three quarters\nNow forgetting ... new information that athletes closing in on a hundred and forty five million dollar plot for a China factory obviously China a huge part of a Catholic potential why does it mean\nYeah I mean it's a big deal on Chinese the Chinese market for electric cars is\nYou know massive and it really hasn't made much progress there at all and if ... was able to you know to get into the market and really solve some cars you know that you know that that will go a long way to sort of improving its bottom line and and just generating I'm a huge amounts of revenue of course with China\nYou know especially in the Donald Trump or they're always regulatory hurdles so you know being able to find a location where this factory you know that's an important you know come first step

I have a gamble or download speaking of which is the co founder\nAnd managing partner of and the ... group in bank called ...\nThe founder and managing partner of and the energy grid and bank called ... and I put the volatility into contact that I caught more myself I've just been told by which is about ... gets a rerun of fabric drawdown of twelve and ... what do you make of it\nI think that's a distinct possibility I mean I think one of the things that's interesting is is a lot of the people who are saying you know we're not when it yet and I think um\nI think we'll we'll let me find that out or when the when the drawdown naturally stopped short of view is we we think that will be things that ah that that provide some kind of a support but actually you know what this is a reaction to really see the problems is is this tug of war that we've seen with them with the fed\nYou know hell bent on implementing a policy that's really really bad for the rest of the world um so if we do see some kind of in the movie ration and we do see any kind of a bouncer do uh I don't think it's going to be sustainable I think that's the key point this might not be this might not be the big draw down but you know what we're probably not too far away from that so even if we get\nA really strong running from here we still think that some pay three thousand even three thousand five hundred is potentially you know somewhere in that range is in play before we really do get into the big correction but you know what I mean you've got to be a lot smarter than I Am to be able to go and try and try and that because I think we're getting very very close even if we say\nI'm a recovering from from this kind of proto correction that we seem to be heading into right now\nPull your words not mine held bent on raising rates\nUm Goldman Sachs because it doesn't matter that Goldman Sachs would make the point that you need to see rates that are on four or five percent Peter Oppenheimer and the team St Louis Freeh point ... percent thoughts and cheapest chips that means you need a late than four to five not the only company given that\nOkay go on why that's completely crazy they're looking at looking at looking at that from the American perspective maybe the U.S market can can can absorb those kinds of rights global markets and the reason we had a pretty strong two thousand Seventeen globally was there was a huge tire when huge stimulus boost that came from the fact that there was so much US dollar liquidity\nDollars was still cheap the interest rates are going up but Douglas themselves just too cheap to depreciating dollar suddenly now we go higher interest rates and we've got an expensive dollar that is the the mother of all headwinds for every market except the u._s.\nI Wish I ... I Wish I saw the Mets are the IMF ... bank maintain and body and south and has learned that Corning all the global thing 'cause I stay tuned for those ... not President Trump as I say in June he sent me back on between ... and south and the fed he said that he thinks that policymakers have quote\nThat she'd gone crazy he repeated his need that the pace of rate hikes and she's ... essay Jay Powell and his team to tighten the president has repeatedly criticized the fat saying he lo right kind of guy\nWell ... the co founder and managing partner of and ... and she and buying caught ball you might have had difficulty he just hearing that the Trump saying that that don't crazy I'm like raising raising by\nDoes that it does that embolden the fad out more that's what started it said to me on the sidewalk in London ten days ago he said if he hates going bad like that they will go harder and they'll get even more advent as you stay\nWith it it's it's strange because like when you find yourself agreeing with what Trump's trying to say it used to find yourself not agreeing with Trump ... you know I'm sure the free problems with the with what he said\nI'm a you know one one is but I'm a ... terminology and we we think is wrong we don't think the fence just going crazy we think the fed been crazy for probably as long as I can remember I mean there's this whole policy is that there's a longstanding policy and it's really it's really bad\nIn so far to drift from reality for so long that it's a it's a it's amazing it's taken this long to come out um another issue or is that\nYou know what does it do for market confidence when you have you know the captain of the team criticizing all these players it's sort of it's a bit like Manchester United themselves at the moment but then you know the issues is this thing about what what kind of a reaction is it going to prompt from the fed\nOr because you know political they just can't be seen to be caving in to the show we we have a couple of use one is that um maybe there were um they don't talk self to\nBut I can be harder or maybe ... um that they'll they'll choke holiday to make it seem like they know Kevin caving in but you know ... they're probably going to be forced to start acting self that because of you know events over taking them rather than anything from saying so we think that could stone to be a yeah\nAnd I'm rather than anything from saying so we we think that could start to be\nA really compete confusion between you know fed message and fed action and we're already seeing volatility creep into the market some you know for the last few weeks there've been some of the the ball is creeping back into just about all the markets and I think that this confusion this this this um\nA tension over most between a fed him president is only going to increase the bullet Felicity\nIncrease in politics and what if what fat in mind so the fat convened by instinct to\nPause ... what was that due to the curb and I I'd go back to Goldman Sachs they are my favorite I gotta say they do they just gave great research in terms of what's comedy okay\nSo what we've got here Paul on the screen is that you can Goldman Sachs say look you've had that there is a bum you had a little bit of a state thing in the tens we put on my thirty three basic points they say things will settle down and get back\nTo curb signing stay calm I'm ... given what you've just said do you agree with that\nBut I think we're going to say two things I definitely think we're going to see kind of flattening but I I also think that the um the the whole uh hiking\nDynamic is is going to start running out of state and they'll say whether whether that comes through messenger comes through action you know ... it's it's going to start running understanding what that means is this this is a massive massive opportunity in the markets right now people should be out there buying 'em\nProbably ten years and and certainly long term treasuries and possibly even the short end as well uh we're we're we're buying pretty much\nAny treasuries we can get our hands on right now because the ... that these levels\nThey can get a cheaper but they're pretty good value right now at a time when everything else even with the you know\nFour or five percent correction everything else like equities are still looking really really expensive so I I I Know so you know we've seen we we do a lot of 'em were ... they were for individuals for ... for a family offices and also for institutions a lot of the portfolio is worth seeing across the board the party portfolios us so\nMisallocated at the moment so out of out of the scale and risk that you know overweight equities within the equity sector overweight beta within the songs that are holding way too many culprits would you think is an accident waiting to happen\nThis is a real opportunity for people to get things back on the right track start reaching equity exposure to start reducing equity beta but really stop buying that are that the treasury a\nAllocation right now which people have been neglecting oh yeah it's a great time to get a very\nBig cause big calls for coming from you in terms of myth allocation of portfolio is at the moment and and in terms of debt they treasuries versus high yield treasuries versus John ... what do you want to do you want to escape from higher than junk into treasuries entertaining thirty\nOf them\nI how you junk even an emerging market that\nThings are just huge accidents waiting to happen right now the complacency in those classes as I'm a level was I'd I'd rather be saying um we we we can see headwinds to Asian bond issue and snakes year that's just a real symptoms that you know this is an essay plus you've got to be getting out of not getting into so out of emerging that both local and a dollar\nOut of high yield uh out of ... there's very little rationale for holding a cobra\nTelling me that ... ... ... ... these markets are accidents waiting to hop on the water by deadly because we've got solving any opportunity to spread will not go to four hundred pages points in St Louis written a lovely story it's I can

Iraq and\nA bum trade is always on the challenge the big problem now is you know the ...\nHas been the debate for ah for the last few years and I'm\nSolving the although again I agree with an awful lot of what he's saying the way that he's saying it I think again he's probably just that I did most of the players on these two men are trying to get these e bay to wait and to protect the Italian
