{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WBCF", "content": "[noise] one radio [laughter]\n\nI'm In San Francisco in this in Bloomberg Technology coming up in our modern coddling settlement with the ending the chair and building we had one of the back of my forty million dollars in fines easing wheel on the road ahead\nThey'd sit there and has a new bond Adam is airing the vice president of products will leave the company taking over from the social networks founders monitor their ... agrees with Mexico and Canada after months of high level negotiations we'll look at the end for tax that China's trade war continues\nTo our top story the securities and Exchange Commission is making Catholics he must pay a price for his incentive funding secured tweets\nOver the weekend mosque agreed to step down as chair of the company he founded for three years a settlement mandates separate twenty million dollar fine for both Tesla endless\nThat money going towards harmed shareholders as a teacher Jake Clinton crazy agreement saying this matter has been widely followed by our main street investors when companies and corporate insiders make statements they must act\nResponsibly what happens now protests\nContinue attempts to meat production deadline\nNot last coup remains to answer\nThat we've got I've and finds that type of financial partner CIA oh in New York and with me here in Studio ... of our data hollows when very busy this weekend covering Catholic so what happened over the weekend that triggered this about face\nWe don't know exactly but the stocks tanked like fourteen percent on friday and that probably has some influence on mosques thinking so he took a settlement deal and then this weekend when the big weekend just for deliveries so now the sort of narrative is back on how the quarter ago and that's what everyone is focusing on now\nWhat the SEC won it in its original was much more extreme than they were at all and there's a question and they can\nMuch more extreme than they were not come as a question I've and they can ... get off easy\nI think that the end result for Musk and protests going who is Tesla's very positive\nI mean the concern was that if he was no longer CEO the company couldn't really suffer that could have heard the employees the shareholders and the car on her so I think this is an excellent outcome\nAnd allows him to be CEO of the company does need to have more governance in place obviously is if they had more governance what had happened may not have happened so I think it's good for the company that they separate the chairman and CEO role threat and two independents\nBoard members and as I said the ... I think he learned you very lucky and this is a great outcome for him and the company\nSaid do you expect that separating the Cherry Hill roles will actually have an impact that a company where I live is\nLarger than life and ... and clearly he he doesn't appear to be moderating his behavior to\nBe clear he's here to step down as chairman still on the board and he can be re elected as chair in three years so it's like a time out from the chairman role but he's not like banned from being chairman for life and I think what really matters is the two new independent director is going to be an end to independent chairman going to be someone existing or someone now\nSo I mean do you expect that this will have an actual impact that it on on the governance and this company\nYes I think that ah the board even though that they are very friendly to along and he is a bird board member I think they need to read it to increase their governance and uh I think that it will have a positive effect\nI think that the outcome is still very positive\nBut there was concerns on friday that this could be detrimental to the company that there were people predicting that this if he was removed as chairman\nIt could have put the company into a death spiral [noise] so uh I think it would have negative to impact the company\nBut so I think that having him remain as chairman CEO is the most important thing and that was the outcome and I think that this was a positive step that they can now move forward to focus on production of the model three\nAre and the introduction of the you know the semi trucks and the new model why in the roaster\nMeantime we're waiting for teen that checks on model reproduction six week as we near the end of the court are down here in our reporting all week and we've had\nBloomberg report this patch to multiple locations ... across the country to monitor delivery why did we find\nThey were jammed so when an even across the country like the Brooklyn store was pretty quiet on Saturday morning but in Chicago there were like Seventy five people jammed into the show really multiple reports on social media people getting their cars\nAs late as late Sunday night and so it went by all means a hurricane and a quarter push you know employees from across the country you were volunteering at the showrooms a lot of existing Tesla owners showed up to help out now we just need the actual numbers\nI you know the number you're going to be watching in terms of whether I'm Catholic can deliver on these promises that must have made even in the midst of all of this controversy\nI figured anything over three thousand model freeze a week would be positive he did six thousand one week or two months ago [noise] but uh there's huge demand for the car which is very good I mean there's still the car the model three as spectacular\nAs are the uh estimate acts which is most important thing that they produced a great car there's a lot of demand for it and there's a lot of excitement around the car and the company and and that is the key thing that will keep everything moving forward\nAnalyzes quarter coming up so critical\nMeans to be profitable and he said on the last earnings call that he expects to be sustainably profitable and the second half of the year so if they have a strong delivery showing and consulting credits they might actually show a quarterly profit which would be the first time in several years\nI've and all of it considered we've gotten outcome suggestions on independent board members are going to be speaking with gene monster of factors that later in the show he's suggesting Al Gore as a potential chairman forecasts but what do you make of some of these names that have been thrown out there\nI think that ah somebody that has from the auto industry\nAs chairman would really be more positive than somebody like Al Gore who is outside the auto industry I think\nI'm a Bob ... would be a good name you know by blood has been very critical of the lawn and Tesla [noise] um so there are a number of retired and and even current auto executives said I think would be very additive to the company\nAnd then it was a reaction and some of the names were here\nI think it needs to I think there needs to be another woman on the board for sure and I would argue with utility experience given capitals ambitions in the energy market um traditional auto I Can't really see\nTests and going along with that I mean they they their their whole point has been to disrupt auto or I don't but I don't know what the process his first searching for the new board member that who's going to decide if they're bringing in a search firm or not so what do we know about the timeline for his uh his to resign as chairman within forty five days and I'm imagining that they will try to get new board members as fast\nAs possible but I I forget what the exact is on that\nHave a model for production what are the other challenges ahead I mean you know he promised profitability I mean as as\nLate as what Sunday early early Sunday Morning after this whole settlement on it now takes on another you know reading up the truth email to the entire staff talking about what needed to be done in order to deliver on its goal of profitability that he has promised\nFirst I Do agree with Dana that the the new board member is should be a woman in light of the new bill that was signed and they do need to have some diversity on their board but the really the focus is going to be continuing ramping up the model free production\nAnd the goal to profitability because those are the two key promises that Iran has made\nAnd then it will be the uh ended up to the semi truck\nWhich is also getting a lot of orders in fact Walmart Canada just place an order for I think thirty more trucks because their goal is to be eighty percent\nRenewable fuel for their entire truck the fleet but I think twenty twenty so there was a lot of interest from a lot of the trucking companies and the consumer product companies that truck a lot of good in the new truck and I think that will be the next game chambers changer for the company\nI mean they're representing the new California sb ...\nThat was just signed into law requiring that all public public corporate boards have at least one woman by the end of twenty Nineteen and and have more

change you know already working I entered the driverless car era where we're not going to need the traditional combustion engine we're going to a lecture again we're going to have\nA strong message that's being played anyway but what this deal does is this going to raise the cost of producing automobiles in the U.S so workers are definitely going to get paid more\nCourts are going to cost more and that caused will get passed on and it's going to show up in the far higher inflation rates are the broader economy and higher inflation rate for the general public that's going to be an issue for
