prep for Kelly grant consumer reporter at CNBC dot com she's also a certified financial planner Kelly what should we know\nFirst thing you want to be thinking about is what is your insurance coverage because for most people you were looking at homeowners vandalism crime that's going to be covered but even when you look at those numbers you know the numbers are up\nYou know these are just claims that are big enough for people to be worth it filing a claim you could have a direct a bowl of several hundred dollars before kicks in so obviously when we're talking about the spike we're talking about big colored claims [laughter]\nUm so you might even have a couple of hundred dollars on the hook before your insurance kicks in um worth it to know what that coverage looks like and then on the auto front what the folks tell us that the insurance information Institute is about eight and ten people have\nA comprehensive coverage which is going to cover vandalism stashed of auto parts all that sort of extra damage that's not a collision so if you're one of those you know to intend that don't have that coverage might be a good time to be making sure that you really are OK with at risk\nThis spike in claims that includes I guess what someone was called mischief night doubles night or the night before Halloween\nYeah that was always a big thing when I where I grew up in South Jersey was the night before and travelers when they were pulling in this data they said that they did see a little bit of an up tick the day before but they suspect that you know for most people if there's damage that's occurring at eleven o'clock at night the night before you're probably finding out about it when you wake up on Halloween they assume that those\nThat spike on Halloween\nHas some wrapped into it from the night before\n... speaking with Kelly grant consumer reporter at CNBC dot com she's also a certified financial planner and she's written a piece titled Halloween is the scariest day

to if you have a pet um you know maybe they are not as fond of all these costume and visitors as as you might be um she want to be thinking about your liability there as well I'm sure\nYou can do things like clear out your yard and sidewalk potential hazards make sure the path to your doors well lit and then consider you know keeping your pets away from the door if you're at all worried about how they're going to react\nTowards it what's the best case against for checking for these potential gaps in insurance you might have not all of us refined print obviously\nI mean it's obviously ... read the fine print if you've been working with an insurance agent or whatever company you're using for your coverage just reach out to them and get a sense of what your coverage might be for some of these things especially for something like liability coverage or dog buy coverage but a lot of variation within their that you know it could be worth a quick phone call him\nAnd then in terms of securing your home that's another kind of key component of this if you're going to go out and do some trick or treating where you're going to some of those sort of festivity you know that's where you want to be thinking about ways to you know just make sure that your house is less attractive target if you've got those automatic lights that come on with movement\nYou know make sure that those are on if you have a security system leave an active show that you know maybe you're getting some some video footage of of whoever's coming up your your walk in any other stuff to turn to that you could
