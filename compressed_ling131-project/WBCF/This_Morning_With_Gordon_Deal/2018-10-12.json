for some that creates financial hardship bucket watches Maria lasagna is here with information on some on demand payment companies that let you decide when you're paid Maria how does this work\nKind of a common problem you know we don't really get certified typically how often we paid our company decides that but the issue is that so many Americans living paycheck to paycheck um you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something\nCheck to pay check 'em you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something else come up before your paycheck comes in\nAnd you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so now we're seeing these smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this um or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your pay check 'em but not as alone more is just you know\nThey might charge you a small fee to give it to you but it's much much less than it would be to get a payday loan or something like that\n[noise] what kinds of fees are we talking about\nSo one of the company is um it's called the event and they're only client right now is Walmart but they say they're going to be expanding\nThey chart just six dollar monthly subscription fee which I'm compared to you know the interests that you can pay on a on a payday loan if it's relatively small\nUm I talked to another company called daily pay and based on their feet they're more similar to an ATM fee and they maxed out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know in an expensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than some of those interest rates end up being\nVery as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks and people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that it's actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reason for that I think going into the story I thought you know there must be some tax free than or some\nPayroll reason but there really isn't um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that\nUm their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so um you know what they're doing it all the time they might get charge more\nSo it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with marketwatch as Maria Lamont yet Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of ... workers are used to doing that\nThat has kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payments cycles um you know every day workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't the top and for me\nSo that conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and it was kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby or company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of\nThe national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that doesn't benefit for their workers some of these companies are happy you know that that allow you to outsource this are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often\nSo we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nNext to Maria Maria lasagna marketwatch it's thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first news\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not

lot of um parents\nStarted out not liking it but the end up liking it\nAnd turn out I guess the biggest question the twenty thousand dollar question what kind of an impact does this have on learning do we know yet\nYou know and I've looked at study after study in ...\nFrom what I can see academics just based on these studies academics are not suffering under the four day and there was actually in school districts to say\nThat they vote is higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days so they're in school more that's how that's

are the most important traits of all humility sushi Shellenbarger has written a story for the wall Street Journal about the humble boss and joins us now see what some of the traits of humble people\nHumble people are able to inspire teamwork and others learning and high performance partly by just being all they're interested in others viewpoints they respond well to feed back\nThere they don't try to hide their own mistakes\nAnd they set an example of behaviors that their team members tend to follow which fosters a real college all cooperative attitude which leads to smooth they're functioning teams it's subtle but it can be very powerful a in getting teams moving in the right direction\nTo what a person is aware of his or her own weakness in the past that was seen as a weakness and how has this changed\nI think we're on the top down command and control I Am invincible leader didn't work relatively well in the you know the sort of vertical\nCompany for the past where it was a chain of command that went up and down I think now we're having much more collaboration among teens across different departments\nUm innovation is coming from all levels at all times and it's really hard for a command and control leader to keep a finger in every pie humble leaders are better able to kind of move among all the teams\nAnd inspire really open honest conversation and interaction so that the team's work better together on it's more than a change even in just quit companies want it's a change in the structure of how we're getting work done\nSo what's wrong with the leader who in the past was charming and charismatic\nAbsolutely nothing and in fact some of those people can also be humble it isn't that if you're humble you're like the sneak person who sits in a corner I'm humbled people can also be ambitious for their team's not necessarily for themselves\nAnd they can be charismatic to they can get excited about the mission that we all share and really get people pumped up\nWhat doesn't work so much is it the authoritarian I Know better then you just follow my lead leader because those people tend to get yes no matter what they say and\nYou know it's a it's a set in Alice in wonderland if you don't know where you're going then you're headed in the right direction um it's really um I can really get companies I'm off on the wrong foot\nWe're speaking with Sue Shellenbarger the wall Street Journal so of course all these terms are extremely general ... you know you're making a general character characterization but are there differences between a humble woman as a Boston a humble man she held to something different\nI it it that's a difficult thing to say and various by workplace um I don't think there are a lot of differences and expectations of\nMale and female bosses in some workplaces in others it's still true that a woman boss wouldn't be suspect if she came across as more and charismatic and authoritarian\nUm I think it just varies it it's true generally that women have tended to be more humble in the past because of their upbringing and their experience in the workplace they've faced obstacles that men don't\nAnd again that do humble buses work across all industries\nGood question um increasingly they do is more industries become infused by technology and I just in time management rapid change it's becoming more valuable in all industries\nSue Shellenbarger the wall Street Journal in thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first news\nYou don't often find the words business and friendly and the same

morning\nThe morning it's that time of year where we're inundated with images of cartoon or cardboard goes but it turns out a majority of us feel like we may have had at least one encounter with the real thing\nAccording to a new a new study sixty percent of two thousand people surveyed say they have seen it goes in their lifetime bought more than forty percent think their pets I'm going to\nSee if they had me right up until they're out to eat on behalf of Groupon also asked people how they react when they do see goes to the top response screaming run away and to be clear men were twice as likely as women to scream and run away when they saw a ghost\nOther initial responses to seeing a ghost include crying hiding and feeding Groupon Halloween studies or respond it's rate the decibel level of their screams on a sound scale ranging from elite falling to the ground to a rocky being launched\nMen rated their screams to be equivalent of a vacuum cleaner and women said when they shriek it sounds like a noisy restaurant\nThe study also identified America's top ten fears that snakes spiders sharks drowning heights public speaking failure bees cramped spaces and rejection wow that was with public speaking in there right after you know spiders sharks and snakes and it's always a good will have you seen it goes to\nA I don't think I've seen one and then it actually living in a two hundred year old house I was expecting to see or hear something but I I haven't seen anything what about you were around I hadn't\nEither but Dixie my cat definitely has team goes like she's all quiet

we know that the Atlanta Braves Gen were one of the major surprises of the baseball season led by a rookie fee no Ronald Qunu junior junior so while they are playoff run came to an early end after a game for last of the Dodgers in the LDS\nThere was plenty for Braves fans to be excited about and one Braves fan is fully invested in the uh Qunu junior\nFor Braves fans to be excited about and one Braves fan is fully invested in the uh Qunu junior hype\nAccording to USA Today when the Braves rookie came to bat and the second inning of Sunday's game three when Braves fan Caitlin personnel tweeted that she would get a tattoo of a coup in his face if he got a grand slam ready to grand slam\nSeconds later the twenty year old came through becoming the youngest player to hit a postseason grand slam but I'll tweet quickly went viral as tends to happen when Twitter's head to ah for these Twitter tattoo pledges\nEven the official Braves Twitter account took notice credit to pronounce because she stood by the tweet with no actual obligation to do so yesterday she got to Qunu space tattooed on her arm and raise some money for the Braves foundation\nSo good for her although we would have been allowed juicy or if she was like a dodger's fan or yeah a fan of the other team she they Braves fan so now she is a tweet tattoo of a Braves\nPlayer or I'm Glad she raised money 'cause the rest of it's just ridiculous [laughter]\nThat she even sort of tweeted that in the first place and I'm kind of releases I just don't get that will put herself out there I might have\nTo say this and that would there's no full picture of her we don't know what she looks like but at least in the picture of a tattoo that I saw both of her arms are tattoo free\nSo it's not like she's somebody you can get all kinds of tattoos and it was no big deal like I think there's probably kind of a big deal for her to do this and it's a weird putting other people's faces on you just my opinion but maybe she
