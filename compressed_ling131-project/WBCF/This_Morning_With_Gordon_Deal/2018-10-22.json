for labor outstrips the number of available workers much of the technology is being used in distribution operations where workers pulling carts are driving forklifts or increasingly working alongside machines\nBuilt to help the goods moving at a rapid pace it's a story by Wall Street journal reporter Jennifer Smith Jennifer set this up\nWell as as you may have seen another reports or the labor market it's really really tight this year and that's both for retailers and for all the workers in the warehouses that they were punished stores and the warehouses that are picking and packing ... e commerce ordered it's really really tight and so as a result\nOpera you know warehouse operators that had made me think and if you know maybe testing out automation here and there are kind of piling deeper into the earth and and and looking for more toward including robot that can help and increase productivity a you know without having to add as many workers as they might normally do because the labor market is so tight\nYeah explain about how some companies are deploying this robot technology\nWell there there there's a range of ways that it's being done on you know on on the warehouse side there's a type of robot called a collaborative little bought a which some people call ... and these are the smaller robots that can kind of share space\n... ... workers at maybe at the mobile robot that it's kind of wake up and down the warehouse Ireland sort of helping workers pick\nOn a you know pick order or buy for the signaling where to get it from workers can take an item and put it put it on this global heart then two windows off to someone who's going to pack it up on in other cases\nA for instance at the gap they've got these robotic arms that use artificial intelligence to help sort out orders um put them in cuts that folks can take them away and packed and there's a number of different ways that robotics are being near\nThe um news is somewhat good for the worker I guess who is still use to pack these boxes go build like a lot of workers and ships have been replaced\n... well so what employers are\nLot of workers and ships have been replaced\n... well so this is what employers are saying is that look we're not we're placing a worker it's with robots what we're doing is it helping them ... because a particularly with e commerce that growth is just continuing they see this demand going up and I said they're able to get orders out more quickly\nUm you know by by using a machine options to kind of helps human workers they can get Law Order that they can get them out faster\nUp but they're still using human workers I'm In and saying that they you know most most people are hiring a hasn't hasn't decreased for church cabbage more that this is helping them kind
