by giving away more scholarships it's a story by Wall Street journal reporter Doug Belkin dog explain\nThis to trends that are really important and one everybody's aware of the sticker price of a college or university continues to rise which\nWhat's happening on the other side though the Granite City inducement to get kids to come study at those schools is also increasing so that the actual price the price of the real costs of college\nHas been flat um and it's actually a tiny bit it some of the public\nSo that you know that's a pretty remarkable inflection point considering that the nation has been so used to sing college costs go up in up in up\nRights I'm Ken this type of trends continue\nYes because there's a lot of pressure on the universities are right now the uh the biggest one is just a demographic decline the baby boomers kids or through schools um generation X is much smaller their kitchen beginning to enter college\nThe recession people had fewer kids during the great recession so there's just fewer kids graduating high school so that that the supply of 'em are the demand for universities\nUm is going down there is especially true many spots show as a result of schools are competing for the students that are out there and giving them some you know financial inducement to come to school [noise]\nUm I'll add however this is the most elite schools or do not play by the same rules as everybody else I'm pricing power for Harvard and Yale and in schools and brand names is is it not diminishing [laughter] but but for schools that are a little bit less\nA prestigious that were demand is noted that's where we were beginning to see this increase in in ... in scholarship offers which is sprayed though the real costs of college\nWill give it some of the the average numbers\nSo what we're seeing is that for private it's right now the real costs the sticker price of a private school um average across the country into a twenty Eighteen Nineteen is forty thousand five hundred and ten dollars but people are paying the real price twenty seven thousand two hundred and Ninety dollars\nAnd that has been flat for a few years less you're twenty seven one sixty I'm right and if you go back to wait on line and it was twenty four thousand so there's been a big ramp up but that they're able to stop\n'em and in public it's about fourteen thousand for the real pressure college\nUp from about eleven thousand in a way to nine but it is actually dropped to thirty dollars a between last year this year so the numbers you know this is this is not a huge savings and there was a significant ramp up which is built into those costs over a decade ago but at least it's a continuing to go up in the way it was\nSpeaking with Wall Street journal reporter Doug Belkin about his story about the real cost of college flattening or in some cases even ticking down a little bit as schools give more aid um use it to the the diminishing pricing power is causing tremendous stress among many lower quality schools as their enrollment decline what's happening there\nSo for schools that are dependent on tuition which means they don't have significant in Dallas um and then they don't have a a a a really strong brand\nUm they're having a hard time competing against other schools to attract were students which means that their class sizes are getting smaller which means that their revenue is shrinking which means that they're beginning to cut classes in professors which means that they're less competitive and that generates fewer classes so the sort of a death spiral for a lot of schools [noise]\nAh that that's going on around the country so the is the sense of the schools more schools are going to close and merge is is very very much in play right
