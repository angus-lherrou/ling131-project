Hill at ... dot com is put together a list of ways to spot fake reviews Katie explain\nThat a lot of the matter of fact it's really hard these days to tell me to be easier right you would just say something it didn't it was garbled and just had five started and it was garbled and you knew that that was not really true anymore they're not people higher gas right where he is and they're getting very good at it [noise]\nUm there was a survey that found that about eight and ten people say that they read a sacred view in the past year I'm In eighty four percent of that and say hey I don't even know if I can always spot take review [laughter]\nSo I just thought you know this is an opportunity to really dig into what is a research showing what experts say about spotting fake reviews for the first one which I had not realized but on\nThem and the timing of reviews if you see a lot you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time\nThat can be a sign that it does or ... years [laughter]\nUm that's either a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch of new review that often happens in a short amount of time if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if they're if they're proud of just launched and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time but again just be suspicious about that\nWell we're speaking with Katie Hill editor at ... dot com or talking about how to spot fake reviews on line or how about the um the accusation or the investigation and Amazon doing that uh there were payoffs right people to delete bad reviews All right\nSo that they are investigating that were not entirely sure if that actually happened they are investigating that they were committed to employees mostly in China um are taking bribes to delete negative reviews and share sales data on banned band account there was a bunch of that now they're investigating it we don't know\nIf it's true or not but you know I mean immediately when I read that I thought wow there's a lot of her views who knows what's going on here but it it's a problem because you were people rely on reviews to to you know what they buy and\nIf they're fake I mean you're you're ... you're not going to like when you end up ... ended up at the end your house\nAnd part of another way you said ... overuse of the words I Me and lots of verbs\nYeah this was a huge study coming out of Cornell that found\nUm online reviews that frequently use I Me are more likely to be fake they don't exactly know why but it could be because when people are lying they try to make and how does that sound more credible by using personal pronounce it they're saying I Need to make it seem like they're they're real person doing this [noise]\nUm and then they are they also found that the ... more verbs and then I'm In the ... century tellers and ... now\nThat's a little bit harder I think to parse out but the eye and then me if you see a whole bunch of that that's a little bit of a red flag\nOr what's the scene setting you gotta watch out for\nThis is another thing from the Cornell SETI okay so they did so and it was looking at a hotel in particular but I think it probably applied to everything\nTo truthful hotel reviews are more likely to use concrete word so they'll say something like bathroom ... can you know very concrete things that people who were lying to fake reviews\nThey were more like setting it seemed like wow that
