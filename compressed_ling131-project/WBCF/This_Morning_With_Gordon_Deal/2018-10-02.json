as one Reddit user discovered living that way for too long to make it difficult to get back on track ears marketwatch reporter Jacob passing Jacob what did he learn\nOne thing that one didn't seem clear to him was the fact that he I was buying groceries you know kind of just as he needed them not really thinking you know more strategically about by what was on sale things like that you know he made a comment\nOr in response to someone else talking about how you know he usually just you know came up with the recipe he wanted to make that night and just got the ingredients that recipe but that that's one way of you know spending that and his food costs where you know kind of much higher\nThan you'd expect um and another way that if they have a\nFinancial problems were kind of in plain sight were uh the expenses related to his car you know he was paying a lot\nIn terms of car payments I had bought a a car fairly recently um and had you know kind of steep loan payments on that um and then and tie insurance payments et cetera and so you know it was kind of clear that there were these two areas where he was spending more that he should um that were causing him to find himself in the\nWhat was the uh the suit Jess June or advice regarding the cars 'cause he seemed to be in a tough spot that knee now owe more than the car was worth one of those deals\nYeah and that but you know that can be pretty common you know a car is to appreciate and value over time and so you know if you don't get a you know favorable loan terms you can quickly find yourself in a situation where you owe more on the car than it's worth and that's exactly the position he was in\nAnd he added to that with the fact that he said he didn't have a good credit history and so it'd be hard for him to you know renegotiate or refinance into a different alone [noise]\nUm and so you know some of the advice was um you know finding ways to make the car [noise] ah you know become an income generator either by driving for Uber or Lyft um they're also companies out there that ah you can sign up and they will basically put a ... adds\nOnto the sides of your car and they'll pay you a monthly fee to basically do advertising for them\nSo that was another way of you know kind of a helping to offset the costs related to the car other suggestions though you know just because uh the the the loan payments words that you know people talked about you know you know driving that extra mile or two to find the cheapest guy\nSigning up for a Costco membership or some other you know warehouse club membership or you might get cheaper gas through that [noise] um and also you know looking into a better deal on car insurance whether uh you know finding just outright auto insurance or um you know

happened to my knowledge he hasn't posted a follow up yet but but I think a lot of people you know\nHe uh I think the advice especially ... when it came to you know uh you know cutting coupons and and strategy of doing that um [noise] ah definitely helped him and I think I think some of it was just kind of a you know it's good to be open about your finances with people when you're in these\nTypes
