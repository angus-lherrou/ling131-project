era of Akron partisanship how do political beliefs figure into these identities Emily badger rights for up shot at the New York times looked at a brief survey Emily would look at\nYou know we were talking about this topic at the upshot because we came across some survey data from the early to thousands where people were asked okay here's a list of identity is which one is most important to you and you know the options are your gender your race your religion the political party that you ... with\nA part of the country that you grow up and and and you know we were sort of surprised by how Americans have answered this question in the past\nA religion ranked really really highly for a lot of people it's one of the most prominent things\nUh you know sort of people's family affiliations whether you identify as a mother or father or life wakes really highly and politics were like all the way down at the bottom of this list\nAnd we sort of suspected that perhaps even see something different if we ask people to question again today because it feels like a moment when everyone is thinking about politics politics there's like a pro bathing everything around us\nSo we we surveyed this question without two thousand people and found once again that politics really aren't as important to people as we thought if you sort of ask them this question about you know thinking about your own identity which parts of your identity are most important to you\nIt's interesting because as you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the piece most Americans don't live and breathe politics the way Washington news beans who\nRight right we have to remind ourselves of this constantly you know those of us who write about these things are letting that most people out in America are not as obsessed with them as we are\nSo what what other changes I guess from the the last time survey versus the this time survey\nOne thing that hasn't really changed and and it's an accelerating over the last several decades is that\nA lot of these other identities is that you know are not political in nature your religion whether you are religious or non religious heal race they have come into alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case\nYou know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that in the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I've found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals are to those nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve meals because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting\nYou know during the during that a school day period\nSo a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the district seat that use for day\nAnd and talking to those parents there are a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it

noticed higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days\nSo they're in school more that's how that's how they feel [laughter] um but

legalization recreational marijuana in Canada this past week it was more good news for candidates friendly Canadians in Canada getting high of marijuana doesn't go with a high cost at least compared with the U.S\nAnd it is significantly cheaper in Canada than in parts of the U.S where it is legal according to a recent report from the data analysis sperm price ... marketwatch reporter Jacob passing has been looking at this report chicken what are we learning\nThey basically looked at you know the price of\nMarijuana and different cities across the U.S and Canada and compared it and what they found is that a candidate says about thirty percent cheaper\nAnd Canada than it is and the U.S and that was before it was legalized so what the report basically said was because Kennedy was more widely available in Canada because it's been legal for medical uses\nA for many years now and so there's a wider range of dispenser either there's a wider range of producers in Canada than there is here in the U.S [noise]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that\nUm that wider range of production ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply you know whereas here in the U.S side you know except for the states where it's legal or illegal at the federal level and so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nAll right so a medical marijuana has been around a long time and again the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know they have a very large legal cannabis industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so\nYou know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and and you know if you if you look at the videos and stuff coming in from Canada folks are kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with chicken ... personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's the cause breakdowns da da dun dun buyouts I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per eighth of announced that but the measurement they use [noise] whereas here in the U.S it's about forty dollars for an eighth of an out so you know for full out you know multiply that out be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U.S that various you know from from city to city um and surprisingly\nWhere it was most expensive was in San Francisco medical marijuana is legal in California but never the last you know that there are you in the U. S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up a dispensary if they're still having to you know set up a whole\nYou know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level and so that makes things harder and drives up costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYou know so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the cost to go down pretty quickly because it would be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level and yet they would be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices and other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it from Canada worth areas is very robust cannabis industry already in place\nRestricted marketwatch personal finance reporter Jake ... thirty minutes after the hour on this weekend [noise]\nCapital one is building something better you can open a capital one savings account with one of the nation's best savings range from anywhere like here for here\nOne of the nation's best savings raising opened on line at a capital one location or from anywhere that's banking reimagining what's in your wallet and\nFor consumers only offered by capital one and a member of the copyright twenty eight and capital one\nMore day for tennis you ready to play is everything All right beside it passed share a liquor dean knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment [laughter] go ahead and practice without\nMe celebrity helps you breakthrough congestion ... non drowsy anti histamine plus a powerful decongestant for twenty four hours of congestion free breather whoa nice Ali how about another only\nIf you go easy on me get a leg redeem then get back to the moment and starts working in one hour available at the pharmacy counter\nMine number ... does not look like and number two I don't know what to call it\nIs there a number three [noise]\nPeople for poor please\nAnd close to the restroom\nMiddle seat with ... stomach problems\nMy fear of flying [noise]\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with a digestive condition called X Okrent pancreatic insufficient see or eat PI even if you don't know ... you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBloating stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy PI because not everybody experiences E. pi on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable suit don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ...
