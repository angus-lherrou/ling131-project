but the things that really should worry Americans aren't always obvious here's where people seem to beer financially and what they probably should spend more time worrying about\nAccording to Ross wiles personal finance columnist at the Arizona Republic Ross explain\nStock market being an obvious one you know we we've had a long run a\nPrices have been you know stocks and fly on the last couple of weeks or lots of big red riding numbers but you got to remember that you know to cook out is part of a\nThe equation and uh you know it's a mistake way I think the bigger the bigger issue for long term investors is actually an fate and inflation which can\nCan really a rose your returns particularly if you're low risk investments in stocks [laughter] about conversely really do provide a good a cushion against a inflation they've really beat inflation over time and I would expect that to continue that\nEven though those are headlines on perhaps a day to day basis about stock market swings can be spooky as you referenced\nAbsolutely I mean he just got to keep it in the contacts and remember we've had a huge run up over three hundred percent over the last ten years in the market so naturally one on one a correction or whatever sets in a it's kind of feel scary the numbers on on the downside are going to be big\nBut you know if you look at it you know all those declare a longer term I don't think it's it's such a problem particularly if you are you know someone who's dollar cost averaging or fixing to rebalance your portfolio or you know these downdraft can be very positive actually yeah but how about inflation here\n[noise] well I mean that's what a inflation cuts ... is a bucket but when a lot of ways but I think uh lately there's been a concern about um you know rising interest rates rising inflation\nThat's certainly bad for bond prices um and it could just higher interest rates are interest [laughter] inflation also could break the economy's slow us down but at the same time I mean I I think you have to realize that inflation and interest rates both are very low still coming off a very low\nLevels and for savers are the people who have been the positives people kept their money and\nVery ultra safe or bank deposit accounts for the last decade they they are benefiting from a little bit higher interest rates and higher inflation so in that sense I think that right you know it's a trend we've had this is actually a good no\nNo we're speaking with Russ wild personal finance columnist at the Arizona Republic part of the usa to noon a USA
