...\nOctober is Halloween season which means that are plenty of funds spooky adventures to check out if you're in that sort of thing and some of those Hans really take things to a new level you only need to talk about some of these extreme haunts she's written a great piece about them for the New York times is Nicole page right Nicole\nHi how are you doing great in reading your article I was surprised to learn that some haunted houses another scary experiences are not just Halloween events are actually opened the thrill seekers year round\nThat's true and that's what's so crazy about this world is you know obviously we have these things like universal studios horror nights every year but there's this group of people that for them that's just not enough and they're just looking for the three hundred and sixty five days a year\nYou mentioned heretic in Los Angeles as one of the leaders in extreme haunts what goes on in heretic\nMan it's pretty crazy I'll say that first of all I'll have to admit I'm not a huge horror fan but I spent six hours at\nA hair to ... so I feel like I really really went in it and it was almost a rite of passage for me to watch people go through this but everyone's experience was completely different that's something that was really interesting to scare actors\nBasically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read to see if they're going to be more creative you know they grab them from the front or grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was the ... around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her raped across it with a rake and then that guy punch through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but\nI've heard of people being stimulated buried alive waterboarded\nForced to eat some pretty crazy things they've had to light other actors on fire there's just some very interesting things that happen here and it seems like each one that happens it's just the next level next level\nYou wrote about one guy who was visiting extreme haunts forty four times though one recently the event concluded with him stripped his boxers and curled into fetal position taken mud straw and simulated body fluids his first words afterwards that was awesome\n[laughter] exactly but that was the one that I was that and\nYou know it was interesting because that took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV they were stripped of their clothes and put in this distress base here\nAnd they were told that they were these criminals that had been on the bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking them through all of them is that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and they ended up in this tent in the back\nIn the pitch black with all this fog and this man is monster with a mask just pops out of nowhere and starts rationing them around and which the spacesuit off scripts them down to their underwear\nAnd is just nearing simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest than yeah so the majority of these protests are going to that end up in the fetal position in their underwear and what was the ... about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking\nWow that they must be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would give it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some rules of these extreme haunts\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys were kind of funny and he told me that his only rules were basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred than\n... but you know they actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them having no touching rule and these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck\nBut they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with surface scratches but they all said that they kind of expected that going in and you know they all wanted to make it known that they're not in to just being tortured for the sake of being torture but\nThe beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves the story forward there are all about it\nThis weekend's gym just go with New York times freelance reporter Nicole pager thirty minutes after the hour on this weekend\nIt's called
