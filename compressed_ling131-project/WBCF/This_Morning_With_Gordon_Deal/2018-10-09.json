campuses across the country\nMarketwatch reporter Jillian Berman says speaking engagements with high profile figures who make headlines from inflammatory comments have been expensive as campuses shell out to create a safe environment for free speech Jillian explain\nThe costs are mostly um around security so and and a lot of cases when these people come to visit and you know there's a lot of protests activity around it\nSo you know sometimes I can get dangerous and then a lot of cases the protests that the protests are kept their also combined with you know supporters of um of these people are coming to support them as well and to sort of clashes between those two you know means that colleges have to security\nAnd so you've got ... type resume campus security and or campus police and occasionally you got to hire an outside actual police force\nRight exactly so a lot of um a lot of colleges have their own on campus police forces you know so those are\nSworn police officers and like any other police agency but you know they can be pretty small so when a when a big event happens and sometimes it's not even controversial like say you know a a big football game don't work with other law enforcement agencies in the area\nAnd then eventually to that sometimes even hire private security guard so companies that that will provide a private security staff and those people aren't\nFlying police officers but they can do things like direct traffic can and you know sort of help guide people to safe area make sure the message that you know the university has crafted whatever it is about the things that are allowed and not allowed to um get to the people on the ground stuff like that\n[noise] speaking with marketwatch reporter Julian Burma than even those costs can be pretty high it it is the school's obligation to pay them they can't build the speaker\nIf it's a public school so public schools I have you know have sort of a lot more restrictions around the stuff that you know because of their public nature\nDo the schools they have to allow they have like a constitutional obligation basically to allow people to speak on their campus\nUm even if they're going to incite violence so we're in disruption I guess I should say so [noise] you know they can put certain restrictions on them like time place and manner so they can try to you know maybe\nSay well the only time that the person can comments during spring break maybe on but they still have to allow them to come\nAnd so you know they don't allow them to come and basically according to the Supreme Court precedent they usually have to absorb the security costs for that\nX Julian marketwatch personal finance reporter Jillian Berman ETs thirty minutes now after the hour on this morning
