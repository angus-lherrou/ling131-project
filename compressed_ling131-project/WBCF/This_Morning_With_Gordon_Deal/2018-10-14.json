on how old fashioned newsstands are becoming snack destinations and is anyone buying paper newspapers or magazines\nI think at a typical news than they might be selling about five to ten newspapers a day so some undermine them but not very many people and this has down from even you know ten years ago they might have sold several hundred newspapers and back in the fifties they might have felt thousands of newspapers\nWhat kinds of products have come in to take the place of newspapers and magazines\n[noise] um that's the thing and that's kind of frustrating but kind of prompted this\nA column for me as I was in times square and my phone had died if I needed something to read and I went to a newsstand right in the middle of town square in New York said actually labeled newsstand and I asked\nYou know I I was trying to read and they didn't have a single newspaper um they have all kinds of candy and snacks and cookies and um drinks you can buy 'em your budget you can buy lottery tickets they can buy lots of different kinds of cigarettes\nUm even by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump in ... and it's and and my PT um\nSnow

make a living that way so in the sixties the said he agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then in the Nineteen seventies that I've read them to let them sort of like pre packaged food and\nItems that cost less than five dollars an hour and so just about anything kind of food or beverage wise as long as those packages and any kind of like ... there's a lot of it's under ten dollars\nThey can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because I think they want to keep them in his hands from competing with for front retailers for good reason\nUm and then the city does have a law that if you're new than you have to sell no and they actually said he told me they send out people to force that last but some very vague law offices that had to sell newspapers magazines have periodicals\nAnd from what I've seen some new standards will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or a lot a lot of space too I'm\nTelling the newspapers because the margins are super low and they don't sell very much they'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and the soda and things that have a lot you know much higher margins\nAre speaking with and get out of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stores I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the newsstands are selling\nThat you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going way back ally on a long time before like you know ... came and so I think even though\nUsually the the retailers I'll Fight it tooth and nail lemon and his fans come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia and the city and a lot of action so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them
