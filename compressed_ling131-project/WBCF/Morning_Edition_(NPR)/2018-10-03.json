Jared and for the Packers update it remember guy markets has brought you buy purple you analyze powered by interactive brokers savvy investors he's probably the analysts to create it consolidate interview\nAnd their banking brokerage and credit card accounts download it today for frayed I'd be K. R. dot com slash P. A. we are broadcasting live from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studio's really one of the main themes today\nHas it been the divergence between small cat stocks\nAnd large cat socks which are reaching new records in particular the S. and P. five hundred and you're just not seeing that kind of strength in a smaller companies shares that benefited previously from some ... around trade Stapleton liver ... the editor columnist and bloggers and life go on the Bloomberg joining us now what do you make of this\nIs well you could argue that it's what people light my call we're version to the meaning in a sense\nYou know the idea that the smaller companies had done relatively well earlier in the year and now they're they're pulling back a bit they're falling when the larger peers are rising uh you look at the ... to thousands\nActually up today not as much as the U.S and the five hundred though of the Russell gaining just to ... percent but when you see the U.S and people have hundred hired by four tenths of a percent and it's actually now a fallen behind for the year as well a Russell up about eight percent while the U.S and the five hundred gay is approaching ten percent\nYou can take a step back and say ... what do people see going forward or are they concerned about you know the economy potentially slowing down\nWe know based on one analysts are predicting that Bernie's growth is going to slow if only because of the effects of the tax cuts that the federal level the and the last year are going to play out you know as\nThis year a winds down so you know next year you won't have the same sort of grow nothing like you know the twenty four percent or so we saw for the U.S and people I've heard in the first and second corners of the year ... still looking for something approaching double digit increases not\nAt that scale though so he didn't even have the trade issues to to to sort of even though some of them are being resolved\nAh it it does kind of raised concern about where the economy is headed so\nWhen you put it all together or you can argue that people are looking for some measure of safety going for the large companies instead of the smaller ones I can tell you back for America Merrill is for one is telling his clients to do just that focus on larger companies\nSo we've got a scenario which is the flip side of what we saw earlier in the air\nAnd they just a couple of thoughts on uh stocks moving higher Alcoa up because of a shortage of aluminum or at least they plan to cut back in the supply of aluminum bats are\nAluminum oxide that use to make aluminum a shares their up a little bit more than seven and a half percent and also JC penny has a new chief executive\nThey do and it's a someone who had run the crass retailer Joanne stores her name is still so tile ah penny's up a little bit more than two percent at the moment I tell you though if you want to look at an individual stocked with a really jumps out advance micro devices M. D. this stock took a beating yesterday because\nThere was a report out the intel is going to speed up the introduction of chips and pulling newer technology\nAnd also perhaps that Intel's earnings are gonna be better than people were looking for but anyway it is it about the competitive balance between intel and am Dee and what's\nBeen the chip industry in general there was no today for Morgan Stanley taken a hit at the semiconductor industry\nOh yeah I mean there's no question but then again you look at intel and it's up today ...\n... oh yeah south um I don't know what I Do want to get your thoughts following the news yesterday that Amazon is going to increase their minimum wage for all employees to Fifteen dollars an hour\nI'm Wondering do we have a sense of how that's going to sort of break down in the retail sector who is going to help put it's going to hurt and and what that does for the whole retailer complex\nWell that's going to be an issue and it's not just for retailers it's for companies more broadly because let's face it when you have four percent unemployment in the U.S\nI mean it's hard to find workers and Amazon has a whole lot of them and pay them Fifteen dollars an hour well it puts pressure on other companies tomorrow sued I mean we've seen the likes of Walmart and target\nIncrease wages you're talking maybe eleven dollars an hour over time and not Fifteen right away so\nYou know it does raise the issue of what do uh the company's biggest peers and then beyond that\nWhat happens with the smaller companies uh was reading a a commentary that focused on you know how Amazon doesn't have to make money necessarily to satisfy investors none of them doing that the last few years but you know their history suggests\nThat profit is sort of secondary many cases the growth so\nAmazon can afford to take a hit on labor costs that a whole lot of smaller companies that have to sustain their profitability just can so it it tips the competitive balance in a way it so you know it's interesting to see all this play out\nFor sure and just maybe just offer a little bit of detail on tempers see me I think is interesting to shares of about ten percent but that may not be a good thing he said stealing I just want to call back into bed\nMe about it and then he'd go look at mattress from or to buy a new bed and that's the thing you know last year these companies cut their business ties\nAnd so naturally from according to Reuters report out yesterday is looking at a bankruptcy filing so now you have analysts kind of coming together figuring that may be temper silly gets its foot back in the door\nYou know starts to be able to self through mattress from again\nPotential plus ... business and you see it play out in the shares which by the way even with today's gay are still down\nSo do you see it play out in the shares which by the way in which today is gay are still down Fifteen Percent of the year\nHonestly the ... business is absolutely the dialing may I just think of going on the subway and all the different ads\nFor on line mattress shopping in Massachusetts that you can put and do a little shoe box and will pop out until Donald size mattress and whatever else and just because he's he's image it I don't know they're just so much focus on mattresses how many people ... mattresses very frequently I just my little accent question they want the ... the editor columnist and bloggers and let's go\nOn at the Bloomberg payment was the last time you buy the mattress\nOr I Confess I'm a mattress shopper\nI didn't I wasn't studios in Washington DC we haven't even had her at the national headlines\nYears and years think at least and to me once called her testimony credible now President Trump is unleashing against Christine Blasey Ford woman\nAnd is at least on toward and possibly illegal is that they used bogus valuations on some of the assets that were being transferred particularly building they hadn't appraiser who appeared to global evaluations on lots and lots of these buildings\nHowever those ... occurred I think well over a decade ago\nAnd uh the appraiser said look I don't have the paperwork anymore and statute of limitations had run so I don't think that there's legal exposure here for the president there may end up being as a civil penalty but there is no I I Would be really I'd I Would bet\nYou know my own small wallet on the fact that there wouldn't be a criminal penalty um I think the larger lesson from it though is is it it does speak to how dependent Donald Trump has always been on his father a to get launched as a business person to fend off bankruptcy as a business person\nAnd to just get repeated to help\nGetting past his myriad mistakes as a businessman\nTim in addition to your book on Trump I Know that you've also written about a a book called the Lincoln\nConspiracy right and I have yeah is there and the reason I bring that up is because that takes a wider view of the kind of tenor of the time between the end of the civil war in the first World War\nCan you describe based on what we know and also the revelations today from the New York times which is you just described may or may not be brand new [noise] what do you believe to be the tenor of the inner circle of president Donald Trump\n[noise] well I I think he's running a very chaotic administration I think it it reflects the Trump Organization\nWhich was very chaotic Lee run it was essentially a cult of personality at the Trump Organization built around marketing him and his name it wasn't a fortune five hundred company it was a mom and pop boutique operation\nIn Trump Tower that really served his needs and he actually transferred that into the White House um the White House was short on process\nAnd short on policy aspirations is long on public appearances and an emotional relationship with the Trump base that works in a campaign it doesn't work for running out of the federal government employs two million people globally\nOne thing that struck by President Trump did respond to New York times article slamming it for being boring old news and saying that now Ninety seven percent of all stories in New York Times or negative on him and just because they're just rip sour on getting the election call wrong\nAnd I guess I'm Wondering how any of this matters when it comes to how different populations in America view President Trump and whether they support him or not\nWell you know it's easy to sort of defined his bases post industrial\nWorkers male workers white workers and in fact I'm affluent Republicans were also a core support group for the president and he's delivered things that cohort wanted he delivered a a a a massive tax cut he has delivered deregulation\nUm he is populated the district courts\nUm those are things that's meaningful to that group of people um the the blue collar workers who support them one child supported him want jobs I Am not convinced yet\nUm that they don't think he's going to fulfill that promise but the clock is ticking on that you can look at places like Indiana where Trump and Pence made a big show saving all those jobs at carrier and then months later those jobs disappeared ... or ... you know there's Fisher fishermen in the coast of\nLouisiana and in Connecticut who who are the feel they've been betrayed you see these interviews and the press where they thought the president's going to do delivery job growth to them and they haven't seen it so I think the job growth but that is going to be a longer term multi year phenomenon right now I think it's based really likes them\nAnd and the Republicans are that are wealthy businessmen they don't care about this other stuff as much if the policies are what they like is that sort of\nI mean I think I think I think it it would appear that that those are pocket book voters and they see the government both both of those constituencies see the government for different reasons as obstructionists or in the way they don't see a benefit from it Trump speaks to both of those populations when he says the government's the problem\nFrom it Trump speaks to both of those populations when he says the government's the problem um and uh for\nAffluent voters they don't need government services much for blue collar voters they need those services but they don't know what they're missing\nOr I'm going to tell you a little bit of a curve ball here but because of the nature of the investigation by the New York times do you think that the president is sympathetic to another round the tax cuts\n[noise] wow I mean\nI think I think the president is sympathetic to anything that makes him look like he's winning and need to find that very broadly um for there to things that motivate everything he does a survival\nAnd ah being self aggrandizing\nThanks very much a Tim O'Brien is executive editor for Bloomberg opinion he
