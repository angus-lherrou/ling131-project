R. dot com slash\nP. A. they will say look like stocks editor columnist and blogger and life go on at the Bloomberg joining us now let's figure out what's going on today because I have put setting out to be a parish day a Dow Jones climbed into the green for a second back down to the red what what sort of driving action today\nJust not a whole lot of direction of the moments I mean a lot of back and forth with individual companies in terms of earnings but not a whole lot of overall movement I mean you can just pick out following yeah I mean certainly one example Pam\nBombing again going\nFine it's ... percent\nBut how about Eighteen the UPS in Texas Instruments so you have to do it three times to make up for the\nThat I'm Talking about three companies that are all taking a hit after earnings mean AT and T. especially down five point seven percent yeah they they lost wireless subscribers in the third quarter when their biggest rival horizon\nAdded them so they're they're losing share that exactly and the earnings are quite a measuring up either and you got to think that's a concern especially because Eighteen teased broadening it's business as a\nResult of the purchase of Time Warner so you know that becomes an issue\nUPS it's all about the popularity of online shipping it costs more to drop off a package or two and houses than to deliver a whole bunch of them and companies\nAnd so you're seeing the effect in terms of their profitability and then the third quarter stocks down more than ... percent in taxes is Ramis was had numbers out late yesterday down five percent and you're seeing other chip makers for as well\nSo did I Want to go back to Boeing because this is sort of the share that his most beaten apple people get worried about trade tensions here that coming out boosting their forecast for the full year ah what sort of does this tell us about the trade tensions perhaps not as having such a big impact\nAfter all or perhaps that it just hasn't hit yet I mean what is it is telling us\nWell maybe the ladder than it hasn't really hit yet because the you got our memory Boeing's got two main businesses want is you know delivering to airlines ah you're certainly China has been a part of that in terms of the growth of the commercial business and then you have\nThe military side and that's where a view Boeing has been doing relatively well or at least they they certainly did and the latest quarter so you know that back and forth I mean you you kind of see how things shake out\nAnd the sense that ah you know terrorists have a kind of kicked in or trade issues or whatever or not enough to really kind of head off the the business to this point\nThey will send a you know one of the things I Know that you're focused on his what's going to happen after the closed today we've got a bunch of earnings coming you got Las Vegas and protect pharmaceuticals visa\nMicrosoft and Tesla what does it tell you that Tesla has advance their report for the quarter you think that is a positive indication\nBut certainly being interpreted that way him I mean when you consider you know Tesla shares\nGrew up ah more than twelve and a half percent yesterday I got to tell you though ah they did move iron early trading now they're down right at one point six percent so\nNow I suppose it's a matter of you know what is it that this company is actually going to say as opposed to well we're expecting earnings last week and we're getting them today and so that's got to be a positive\nIt didn't look at the end it's about this company's ability to deliver on on their goals and indeed we are talking about deliveries especially with the model three you know the one that's supposed to make them profitable and you name it so uh there's a lot that Tesla has to live up to find out if the clothes out while they're doing it that\nSo I Want to shift a little bit to the bond market we're certainly seeing treasuries rally yet again today and you have of course overnight President Trump\nAt telling the wall Street Journal that maybe he regrets appointing Jay Powell to be the head of the fatty ... thought it was a low rates guy but who knows now and saying that he thinks that his biggest a potential villain or the ... in his plans is ... ... a chair Jay Powell because they're raising rates too quickly\nUh people seem to be ratcheting back their expectations for how quickly the fed will hike rates the interesting thing to me now is high yield bond had been resilient but that's cracking now and you're starting to see ... climbed the highest levels in two years and yesterday's Netflix jump on deal didn't go that well\nWhen you put it all together I mean think about it is the economic outlook isn't so great\nWell that gives the fed raise the kind of a take its foot off the gas when it comes to raising rates it becomes an issue for\nCompanies that are borrowing I'm a high yield bond market and\nYou know so it's all kind of a peace at this point that you can talk about the criticism that President Trump's delivering all you want but at the end of the day you know what the fed decides is really going to be a matter of you know how does the economy looking\nYou know from what you're seeing with companies I mean inflation looks like more of an issue shore\nBut you know then you have the potential for slower economic growth as well and you know that's going to be something that the fed is is paying close attention to hear\nThat you mentioned the economy and just to reiterate the new home sales figures for September they came in at five hundred and fifty three thousand economists\nWere all looking for six hundred and twenty five thousand so that was a big mess they also revised the lower\nThe results from August we've got five hundred and eighty five thousand that was the revised figure when we reported in August when the government released that information was six twenty nine so we were down three percent last month we're now down five and a half percent\nThis month that tells you a little bit about what's going on at least on the housing market\nKnow what else tells you something I'm looking at it and accept us in the home builders than it did back off after those numbers came out a higher on the day after\nDidn't back off soon after those numbers came out get higher on the day after having rally yesterday in the wake of what's been a tough nine months for the share so you know the question going forward becomes is the housing outlook all that bad I Am and what we've seen already\nLuckily we're going to vote the next two hours to answering that question ... the editor columnist and blogger at ... am live go on the Bloomberg market drivers report is brought you by march ... El Al ... Senate advisors and how closely held and family business has reached their goals\nFor over a hundred years Mark Penn is success is personal learn more march ... dot com slash success right now let us have some success heading over to and I did not win studios in Washington DC native world national headlines thinking\nI was just on a panel where there was a reference oak tree saying that there's a correlation\nTo cap rates of about point eight\nTo one as interest rates go up so it was interest rates rise pricing should come down there's been way too much money chasing goods here cap rates were at three and four for a few years three three and four percent maybe even negative yields\nAnd you've seen the bit asked spread changing a lot so it feels like there's going to be re pricing although New York city is still the best capital in the world and lots of international capital is still coming here\n[noise] I Wonder if you could just take a step back and tell us about the ... men Dick\nAnd what influence Bernie meant they had\nOn your career that's a question I didn't expect a Bernie mend it was the chair of ... and\nI knew him and my first real estate for New York yeah yeah it's real real estate board of New York and um I had been an integrated resources in might start after Harvard Business school and he told me I was going to be nothing unless I started my own business\nAnd um that was pretty brave that was thirty five years ago for a woman to try to start our own business as an owner and developer and um I did it was right advice\nIt was great advice and I have a picked a great partner within partners thirty four years or he made fun of me at ... in a way 'cause that was Bernie style and um he was a great influence and I'm very grateful he passed away many years ago but he was a real entrepreneur and I've been able to fall a little bit in his footsteps\nYou know I Want to pick up on a point that you were talking about with respect to foreign money coming into New York have you seen that slow with possible capital restrictions from China or just a slowing of the economy there\n[noise] Canada has increased they're investing in New York particulars as myself market that I focus on 'em there's definitely been a slowing down an Asian money but there's still enormous amount of capital of coming here I'm also from Europe at this point so it's really just an interest rate story from your perspective the cooling\nIt's there was ... interest rate an alternative investments as\nOne can invest again in bonds you see even like black rocket three three billion dollars go out from their stocks in the last quarter so you're seeing money flow from stocks into investing in bond investments again and and therefore\nYou know real estate which should catch up eventually with with inflation I think you you'll still have a steady flow\nAnd we're not we're not going off a cliff this time\nYou've been quoted as saying that in midtown Manhattan will look really difference but it'll take five years most likely ten tell us how it will look different\nOkay Lisa and I were talking before the show about our strategy for thirty four years has been buying an emerging neighborhoods we bought a in Harlem we bought in a ... we bought and know how we bought in Long Island city oh almost Thirty years ago midtown east is the new emerging market\nAnd it's so out right now tennis or paying more to be like Netflix paid a hundred and twenty dollars a foot to be on Broadway and Eighteenth street nobody wants to be in midtown that the new zoning that we finally got after eight years of fighting is going to help kick start\nThe renovation and rebuilding of properties and it's just going to be re imagine it's going to take at least five maybe ten years for it to come back it's still an epicenter of New York are you buying right now in uh midtown east or are you sitting on the sidelines for a while\nWe're waiting for pricing to get a little bit more realistic but we have a war chest of a few hundred million dollars ready to pounce with institutional partners to back us up how much do prices have to come down to get in\nThey just have there has to be more volume on the market and I think about ten percent maybe Fifteen\nRebuilding the rebuilding of Park Avenue do you see the vet calculus changing at all\n[noise] well I I think Fisher Brothers had this fabulous contest where they had the ... everything being re imagined um they're doing a great job in getting creative and I think there'll be something happening in the next five or ten years and it's necessary to make it cool against\nThe recent announcement the tape you Morgan it's going to tear down their building Park Avenue build a new bigger better brighter color is that what's gonna happen [noise]\nIs going to be one example of many that you're going to see their the air rights transfer that you can have\nThat is going to be one example of many that you're going to say they're the air rights transfer that you can have from landmarks that's happening in multiple buildings right now is there any\nNeighborhood in New York City that you think that even the values appreciate going forward in the next say two years the boroughs\nReally even after Brooklyn are already like follow the opportunities zone\n... legislation is going to bring a lot of money to the to the boroughs
