bloggers and life go\nOn the Bloomberg come in here I it just within the past few hours we got this news that President Trump is thinking of withdrawing from me when a hundred and forty four year treaty\nHaving to do with shipping and China and I'm Wondering whether a ratcheting up of trade tensions is behind this leg lower that we're seeing across the U.S and this is\nWell it's certainly part of the mix here I mean there's been so much focus on the back and forth in terms of trade\nAnd you know when the New York times story came out I couldn't help thinking about a Amazon if only because you know Trump is decried the uh these charge to the company by the U.S postal service\nBasically saying there to do so it's not a surprise that the issue of what China pays for shipments would come up and you know beyond that and it's a matter of you know just the pressure being brought to bear and the extent to which a few people are focusing on that even as\nThe earnings you keep on terms of third quarter result right\nBecause there's just to give the detail I think the treaty\nAll the signatures of the the the signatories of the treaty have to pay a fee and dues in other words to be part of the treaty\nAnd because of the way the news is set up right now it costs less to buy something in China have it's sent to the United states it costs less to do that\nThan it does to buy something in the United states and send it to the same customer in the United states because it's basically being subsidized\nBy the U.S postal service to bring those packages in from China and that's been the big contention\nFor members of this treaty and it all has to do with the commerce\nYeah it does and that said when you look at the publicly traded shipping companies you know FedEx UPS they're basically down with the market at this point so it's not like this is changing the equation for the industry it's sort of more of the back and forth in terms of trade here\nAll right so we have that are ongoing and we'll bring you more updates on that as we uh progress that day I mean there's a big back and forth whether this has been a net positive or negative for the U.S economy and we will dissected that in the days ahead as this report I get some more legs I Do want to just take into a little bit the market right action today Netflix\nLeading the charge shares up more than six percent but less than the eleven percent surge that we saw in the immediate aftermath after they reported earnings how important was this tremendous beat of theirs yesterday\nOr the bends on whether you're betting on Netflix certain betting against them like a whole lot of investors are doing a it it's an issue if only because you know one thing that sort of stands out is that if you look at\nThe main industry groups in the U.S and the by far the girl down today but one is doing relatively well is communication services this is the group that was just set up an introduced last month\nNetflix is part of it along with the likes of Facebook and Google's parent alphabet that's three of the four face stocks right there the other one Amazon dot com still in the consumer discretionary category which by the way\nHappens to be the worst performer on the day in the U.S in the five hundred I mean that's retailers it's media companies is home builders that's your name and so\nUh it's a real mixed there and we saw the rating cuts on the\nHomebuilders out of Credit Suisse which may help explain why that that brought her to ...\nAnd they were insistent willing paying housing starts out as well that didn't help either\nNo it did not so when you put it all together I mean certainly you see why that group I take it and the other hand the makers of consumer staples food beverage tobacco doing relatively well along with this communication services category or\nCan we just mentioned General Electric you know we're always kind of talking about gee even when the stock falls but those shares of General Electric or higher right now by a little bit more than three percent and this has to do with a potential multi billion dollar deal to supply power a generation\nIn Iraq and we don't have a confirmation of that deal but it could be worth about Fifteen billion dollars\nWell the power business especially is GED suitably shuffles itself under a new CEO Larry Cole but me becomes\nMore important to the business is why you a couple of weeks ago you had this issue come up with some of their turbines yes ah and stock took a hit because of that so you know this is the flip side of it to the extent that this business does well arguably gee is in a better position to get out of the whole it's been in after ... years of declines the\nShares let's talk about drugs\nLet's talk about marijuana okay so let's talk about the fact fact Canada legalized ... yesterday I Believe it's the first day and I'm today pot fast tumbling and the first day of candidates legalization of ... what's going on\nI'm tempted to come back to that old by the rumors so the news\nOr anything on second you're holding up the Business Week Bloomberg Businessweek a cover article this beautiful what what what

blog\n... remember get that edition of Bloomberg Businessweek the cover story pot of gold now let's go to Nathan in our Ninety nine one newsroom in Washington DC for world a national headlines Nathan ... special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe could be close to a conclusion that is what sources are telling Bloomberg\n[noise] it's tough because there aren't a lot of options there than a lot of supply and\nSo if you have to be invested in high heels and those are the buyers high yield funds in general you've got to buy what's coming to market and you can make the case that it's good relatives value you're getting have quite a bit\nBut eight percent may not cover the risks that we see down the road if\nHoover isn't able to execute perfectly I don't know how many new young companies have been able to pull off executing things perfectly even at my old age I'm not executing things perfectly stuff [laughter]\nI Want to put a larger question to you which is that the total us debt to GDP ratio is currently around three hundred and forty percent and if you will include state local that\nContingent liabilities this goes above five hundred percent Oh yes and in global debt to GDP has surged\nIt's over Seventy trillion dollars was at at the global death totals since two thousand eight why would people be buying an asset that has just swamped the market\nWould supply it\nIsn't rational in the long run but in the short term and if you're only short term oriented you can make that case that the trouble that investors are going to get into that if you only think about the short term\nYou or eight percent is going to be a lot lower in terms of your real return down the road pay attention to where rates are headed long term it's eight percent of the\nParty and believe do you believe that in the book will could have divided institutional investors do you believe they recognize the risks or did they see that they can get out\nI think they think they can get out um but I also think they operate in a short term environment where there incentives are to make it through this year\nThey're not thinking about what do I ultimately want to be able to deliver we've come so far away from what our job ultimately are to do a that we work in very narrow a space\nAs well but hold on a second because a lot of people have been a sort of foretelling gloom and doom sous twenty twelve twenty Thirteen given how low rates were going and short term turned out to be five years six years so you know what is short term especially if people don't foresee a downturn that that is a very good point\nAnd I think it's part of what keeps people anchored\nI'm In the old ways and not thinking about how differently the market could be the biggest signal has been the correlation between stocks and bonds of late Assad in February stock sold off bonds for centrally flat when they should have rallied\nIt happened again in the last few weeks when we saw the equity

but there are areas of the world particularly Latin America that look attractive and I think age that down the road because of the\nUm [noise] differences the long term tension that is increasing
