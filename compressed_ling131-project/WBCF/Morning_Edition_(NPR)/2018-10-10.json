editor columnist and blogger and I might go on the Bloomberg joining us now\nI really it seems like the NASDAQ is really leading the decline so that nearly two percent loss or just in the initial half hour of trading what's driving that today\nWell one thing that jumps out in terms of ah the NASDAQ is what's going on with the semi conductor stocks and\nYou know this is all about the back and forth perhaps between the U.S and China when it comes to a leadership and the chip business and I say that because\nHuawei technologies best known for its smartphones are comparing era of apple in China or they've introduced artificial intelligence chips along with cloud computing services and data centers for self driving cars\nThat run off the devices so you know the idea that maybe they're kind of getting ahead of the competition definitely not be a more got in video shares down about four and a half percent Qualcomm and sour\nSo but but but what happened overnight because this has been known for a while\nRight well they actually made the introduction so you know now that it's out there and people can take a look and see where things are headed what the plans are and\nYou know let's face it I mean the chip industry here in the U.S has been back on its heels a bit lately anyway so the idea that you know this kind of kicks things up a notch you can understand why the reaction would be what it is\nWell they've also if you take a look at the performance of the Philadelphia semi conductor index it's basically made a round trip I mean it's down to ten percent on the year and it's down forty two points today that's drop of about three percent\nBut having said that we know that a variety of Wall Street analysts have come out and downgraded the whole sector\nRight I mean there's concern that or perhaps there's going to be too much supply that a demand isn't going to be there to soak it all up and you know you mentioned the or the ... the socks this site the ticker on this\nI mean really you could argue it's been up and down for the past twelve months or so and it's heading back toward the bottom of the rain so the question becomes if the industry outlook is really taken a turn for the worse will that kind of fade here and and that becomes something to watch\nAnd others share that I'm watching is uh the shares of CBS which are actually going against the grain stay\nA and gaining a mother that seven tenths of one percent also at not\nUp even more and this comes as it possibly the merger between the two her eyes CBS is\nSix to eight billion dollar takeover of at NIH will win and he has approval as soon as Wednesday max meets any who covers all things having to do with health hospitals in the entire industry of pharmaceuticals joined us here I ... he works with of course but my opinion that match what's your take on that but it's surprising\nA no not particularly this comes pretty quickly on the heels of a cigna's purchase of express scripts getting getting approved this is a very similar deal and uh at no already sold off some Medicare part D drug plans which was the kind of major really only area of overlap\nUm so the the administration hasn't seemed particularly interested in in putting barriers and the way these deals so it's not too surprising one\nThing that's really interesting to me is just this pave the way for other mergers or does it sort of grease the wheels from our consolidation like this\nUh yeah that that wouldn't surprise me at all this kind of represents a multi year trend in the healthcare industry of\nUm companies ... kind of combining across sectors are trying to aggregate buying power trying to to offer kind of a more complete offering a as the healthcare industry kind of continues to shift get more cost focus so I don't think this will be the last year this type\nThat will see or not that this is going to necessarily affect the outcome of this combination but the head of the Connecticut pharmacists association said that they are concerned about this ... a combination between CBS and at that because they believe it will lead to higher costs reduce patient choice\nAnd Dr independent pharmacies out of business do you believe at least the third the last item is true\nAh I mean yes most likely you know the all of the things that the scribes are are have been the consequences of\nOf kind of consolidation of providers PBS and\nUh and and insurers in the past and you know\nUh when you get market power you tend to raise costs\nThey like to often kind of make the case that increase sufficiency negotiating power all of that will uh will lower cost than but when they are everything when they controlled kind of big swaths of the industry and an even bigger one in this case combining one of those countries because insurers and the big ones because premiums\nAre you probably will see some higher costs of cases ...\nIs there any possibility that we will see sort of a non urgent care facilities start to appear in CVS locations\nI I think that's that's highly likely that is what kind of one of the the more interesting central outcomes of of this of this acquisition is that CBS will turn in stores increasingly from kind of the current\nRetail model where you go pick up cold medicine and you're in your prescriptions to something more of a healthcare destination and that will help them get more out of ... too so it makes sense that they'll try to do that\nNext season thank you so much for being with us Maxine handed a Bloomberg opinion columnist covering biotech pharma and health care
