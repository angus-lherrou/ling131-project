I'm I'm ... I'm going to be Ted Cruz again this year for Halloween Oh thanks [laughter]\nHave you got to do something easy one for me go to the I was in a little I got to work on the act signed up with that I'm going to say GM or sprint which one well I tell you you know everywhere you look today if it you know when you have a car makers beauty products makers\nBeer makers ah and Facebook all popping on earnings I mean it's safe to say you're a happy go to the markets firing on all ... I mean part of that is because\nIt's the reaction earnings are in my opinion depends on what the market was doing leading into them if you're if you're trading sideways going into earnings you get kind of a real sense of what Wall Street really thinks of the earnings we'll get a company like Facebook coming down over thirty percent since July\nUm it didn't take really blowout numbers to cause a little ... shares 'em up six and a half percent yeah which show that's you know that sort of leads the charge to the communication sector it's all the really important sectors in the lead today which is is interesting communications tack\nConsumer discretionary industrial financials all up at least a percent and a half\nSo ... you know for the chart watchers this allows the S. and P. to break sort of this really clear down trend that we've seen in this corruption a lower Lowe's and lower high so we've kind of snapped data that which I think is you know\nIt ... at least offers at least a glimmer of hope that um this this little bit of volatility we've seen a is at least slowing a for now\nAll right so like your job is to give narrative\n... and in the way I mean he has to tell us why he was not just why you have to characterize what we're seeing accurately and I know people push back would you say plunge went into debt burned you know I mean the all these words are sort of careful I think you push and Buckley so that's why I Try to create\n... everyone else by the way it's like the fighting my thesis that says well I was curious\nCurious about how we would characterize it is it sort of taking a breath and processing and some of these positive earnings and actually receiving them as positive whereas uh over the past few weeks we've actually seen positive earnings and people are just ... yeah I think\nYou know it's positive earnings happened dismissed I mean you know the sort of glass half full half full half empty thing when the market is in freefall\nYou tend to be skeptical and look at the glass as half empty until it gets exaggerated to the point where you're like wait a minute why use Facebook can anyone really explained to me why Facebook is down thirty two percent since July because they actually make money it's right to make money I mean look their growth you know and we talk about this to further their growth is slowing its diesel rating\nUm but there's a lot of sort of runway with a company like Facebook to to ratchet up that growth in the future\nAnd the you know the all the analysts now we're talking they're getting excited about Instagram and Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and all the sort of\nA products that are not the marquee products that Facebook has that probably have a lot of room for growth looking for a good positive store right sort of looking at again you know it's ... you know after a punch like we've seen um you know\nThe the revenue growth is celebrating the user growth has to celebrating the margins came down a little bit uh this quarter\nIt's not you know it it's not your typical uh sky's the limit type of report for Facebook um but it's certainly doesn't uh justify the sort of pessimism that's been built into the sheriff's\nCan I just say that one of the best Halloween costumes that I saw was a couple who dressed up as a one with filter and one with no filter a with\nAnd I felt there had you know the birds around the head or whatever it is pretty girl I'm not no filter and her husband and I asked him wearing a leg beard\nI saw one the woman who was the Banksy painting and she was falling\nOut on the window [laughter] I hate to interrupt this moment but I Want to ask you to mind the gap Michael ... when I talk about the gap I'm Talking about yesterday's trade because there was a big gap\nHigher but I've got the open that matches the gap down that we saw I guess that was when like maybe the twenty fifth twenty fourth of October and\nI remember hearing quite a while ago the it was an Ali moment in other words you've got to have that gap up in order to really\nCement the change in sentiment or direction have you found that\nPeople pay very close attention to these gaps or you know the the negative side of that would be when you see an opening gap like this hum that we've seen tomorrow in other words like you said the U.S and the opening a good chunk above its highest level on record I\nBet that space in between uh it's like serves as a magnet that will be filled at some point\nUm so but you write that some people view it as okay that gap snaps the the down trends we saw that also in it on the twenty sixth that same gap open higher right and you know I think um to some degree with markets trading twenty four hours and futures need chefs now\nThe opening closing gaps hum might not hold as much weight as they used to I remember last year there were\nDozens of gaps ah that that went on filled you know a eventually they were filled or many of them after the these corrections we've seen yeah um so it's tough for somebody giving them for sure\nTo keep a few other notes in debt markets to keep an eye on the yields on the lowest rated junk bonds have risen to the highest level is twenty sixteen I think that's kind of interesting\nAnd the lowest rated junk bonds have risen to the highest level is twenty sixteen I think that's kind of interesting definitely seeing people start to price in a credit risk again I also sort of interesting to see that several deals have been pulled from the market\nUh so you are seeing a little bit of jitters there although sprint and GM ... huge debtors their bonds are popping staff that they could earning so a leading credit markets a little bit higher stabbed him\nYes indeed and I just want to bring you this do that mark last through the chief executive avenue capital group he says he's buying Tesla's debt and not worried about the carmakers ability to pay [noise] thank you very much Michael Reagan America's Team leader for markets live block malice or Ninety nine one studios in Washington DC where Nathan Hager has world a national headlines making\nWhat this call's was a sharp or slow down and people had been anticipating and then you throw on top of that what's happening with the trade war which hasn't really big yet or will really start biting and twenty Nineteen\nAnd it's a problem okay but then I get this raises a really important question because this morning we're getting news that China's considering adding even more stimulus and we had seen signs that theory leveraging in order to stave off some of the declines the weakness that we've been reporting on my question is\nIf they side de leveraging is so important that they actually went ahead with it even though they knew it was going to solve the economy what is the consequences going to be of than adding more debt to the already enormous pile that China has\nWell if if your choices continued deal eh bridging and have growth slow more meaningfully than you want it to inform further below the official government target or stability with some leverage at least short term you're going to go with stability right\nSo uh I think you're certainly going to see more action from the government to spur growth uh I think that some of it a lot of it will be through um spring infrastructure investment in in some smaller cities they need it\nYou know they they're we yeah actually it it it needs to be very targeted but if you think about it you know China's urbanization rate is about fifty percent if you look at most developed countries it's closer to Seventy percent or so there is more room but it needs to be done smartly right\nI think what caused the problem with the debt the ... the thing that really catalyzed it\nWas during the two thousand a financial crisis when the government did a pretty big stimulus package\nAnd that stimulus package was distributed through a broken capital transmission mechanism\nSo uh what that meant was in really short\nBanks were guaranteed a three hundred pages point spread\nNo matter who they went to so basically largest so we used to didn't need money got it uh this late owned enterprises they don't enterprises yes and this led to a helped fuel the overcapacity that we saw the the real estate sector was helped immensely\nOr this led to the overcapacity on that side of things so it's it's more ... they've they've done a lot to modernize the financial sector since then it's not done but they've done a lot so it's not\nAs broken so it's trying to get the funds to the right areas and I think another thing they want to do as I mentioned\nThe sectors that really would would be boosting growth\nAre are are some of the private sector of technology healthcare some of the consumer stuff they're trying to get those companies funds\nAre so it's a balancing act but the delivery urging agenda is shelves for now for sure I think that's gone for the time being\nUm and you know one thing to keep in mind we may get a little bit of a\nFalse positive on trying to growth because you could see exports surprised to the upside again before the end of the year\nBecause if you look at what terrorists are in place now versus what could be in place next year it goes up pretty substantially so people on the front run that you know people want to buy Chinese products now before the cost goes up so um that's why I say you might not really see the bite until twenty Nineteen ah so that's something they want to they're going to want to get ahead of the real risk though\nIf you want to be worried is what's gonna happen with capital flows um there's there's a lot of debt that needs to be rolled over in China so if you start seeing like you did in twenty Fifteen strong out capital outflow from China that could be rather dangerous and that is certainly something that government's going to be keeping an eye on and try to get ahead of\nHere's a quote from the economics professor who oversees a survey that is sort of like R. P. M. I. survey in China the quotas for most business has never been worse\nWhat do you make of that and if you are predisposed to invest in China isn't it better to invest now than it was a year ago\nI think that you know like I said the de leveraging agenda has hurt a lot of companies ability to uh raise funds and it's also made it more costly so if you're running a business that certainly isn't great uh it it it's better if you're in that so we uh for for for ... state owned enterprises for certain reasons and then if you look at the\nCurrent outlook right you have the U.S threatening wider tariffs\nOr you know when you you you you you're not sure what's going to happen with this whole U.S China relations which is one of the most you know the most important bilateral relationship and the word or world right now or that gives you a lot of uncertainty because we're also seeing consumer spending swelling bitten China right this isn't just weakness in one isolated area it's a slow down you know\nIn slowing a bit in China right this isn't just weakness in one isolated area to slow down you know broadly speaking across the economy so I could see why people might be pessimistic in China or as with especially with the added uncertainty of what happens with those U.S China relations\nAnd of course I just started speaking to your point about that concerned about capital outflow as we're looking at the un and which is currently the weakest versus the dollar since two thousand and eight so this is sort of the concern right is that the more people withdraw money from the economy the weaker the currency was just a escalates into this micro you'd have to have you back\nBecause it's always inside with the state with you Mike McDonnell cheat the kind of messed up for financial products of Bloomberg LP Sarah with us talking about China's plan to additional stimulus\nA really interesting short run it makes a lot of sense for China to be a adding stimulus that in the long run they still have to deal with that tattoo overhang cutting\nUp we're going to be speaking with Tom Kennedy had a fixed income strategy at J.
