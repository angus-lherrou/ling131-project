advisor now here's Tom Chrysler\nCoast to coast and law enforcement shingles this is a money been home improvement show on Tom Chrysler and today is a very exciting show for us because we're coming to you from Jamestown Rhode Island\nThis is the site of the latest project for the forty season of this old house in today is the final day of production we're right here and actually in the garage it's a lot nicer than that sounds surrounded by the cameras and the saw those to bring you the story of a very ...\nBy the cameras and the sauce to bring in a story of a very ... just completed by the spectacular team at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island\nIs a coastal town it's it's just across the Narragansett Bay from Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if it didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt or asked or or do you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and many of these houses date from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds when summer visitors built them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches\nBut today many of those dwellings remain on insulated and since they were originally built just for the summer season there was really no need for insulation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt\nTo increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm now to kick things off I'm joined by this old house any contractor Richard drifting we walk and Richard thanks so much\nSir Richard only say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because the plan was to make this a net zero house so those are not familiar with ... zeroes kind of explain that\nThere's a bunch of components to one is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty\nWalls in our forty ceilings and and we made it tight tight tight and then on top of it we we did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we we controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you got to make a place where the tight\nThen you've got to be able to make some electricity so we put Eighteen solar panels on this brilliantly designed garage which just as behind the building away so nobody sees it it's perfect dangle so it becomes this terrific collector for us and so we could make\nAbout five kilowatts electricity so\nWe can make electricity were super tight we can make electricity in the last piece to have a really efficient heating and cooling and ventilation system which we we did a and then some and I'll tell you that in just a second so the combination of those three pieces is that when the sun is out right\nWe make electricity and we spend the meter backwards back to the utility and then when it's not out at night or and cloudy days we use electricity as we need to feed and cooling and running the building\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems with one of which was the insulation still talk to me about the insulation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a\nYou know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support you know the roof load itself right now today's standards with the insulation in the energy codes we've got to make room for insulation or\nAnything like that you don't even know\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like clothes so a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building\nSo we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all of a room on the inside right now the advantage to the adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier around the the framing members which are much more conducted transfer heat also\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finish I'd had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys did a really terrific uh works here with all of the detail and the trends in ceilings and stuff to talk about uh\nWell uh I give credit to the architect dom powers who are really\nJust bought about every space in the house and took advantage of his expertise and the design world and and really created a master poll a depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a\nYou know all we did was follow his lead and not and execute a but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nAll the sounds are those are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left us do it it really\nTurned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a so you know a meal to already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um they were right down the road so it eliminated a third party in the middle so it really ... really did work out well\nBut as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home had a lot of work done landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize a part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had\nOh what was the challenge while the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hearts gay\nAnd then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having\nAnd then the the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see it rollout chefs winter the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money pit that was my pleasure you can follow along with

house and one of the guys who's written part the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda and just keep getting younger don't\nYeah [laughter] well almost

down because I work for my dad we would just\nI ... well maybe that's it that way and turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad he had didn't want any part of the details anyway but now it's you busy\n[laughter] yeah right exactly TV stuff [noise] so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think\nPrefab or factory built into well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and and ... you weren't specifically to things that you did hear that were this fascinating to me\nThe foundation first you think oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNow you know you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought here they bring\nIn ... well pre cast foundation it's insulated it's and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it\nInsulated so there's no thermal break in that in that position and the studs a pre drills the electrician to run his wires and it's a fast efficient way to put a foundation and that's\nBasically waterproof the same time\nWhile and the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was back to rebuild as well as soon as\nThis is a pre cut building well you put it together everything's caught on a on a CNC so yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know what the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that it it essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see spray foam used to different types of Springfield open\nAnd close close though and then you had sold ... in which ah actually I Love that isolation I mean I think of it is it's basically rock writes funding to fight molten rock and ... and ... it's an right insulation for sounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's where you take the insulation the the stone will insulate or you can also use rigid phone and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the whole building we had to deal with the conventional walls right\nThose will spray foam on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier because you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when you when it meets that different insulation so\nIn other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation is that makes sense that what it does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're\nPutting something like a um it's it's called like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation on it's like a range Rangel if any any condensation should occur in between that insulation it will run down and not damage that she\nWas actually has to be completely storm only separated or the other you know it's almost like when you're building sounded the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here right now which are firmly separating everything's in good shape and insulation ... exactly right yeah that's the trick\nNow you also had to install solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wouldn't shingle roof here now which single roofs is they're not done right and I've seen an awful lot and I know you have to they write like\nCrazy saver I fast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... today is not like ... it was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get from lumber is really farmed trees younger trees because all the big old tight\nReign trees are gone now but would will absorb moisture and so on down the line so what you would do years ago you would have what is called skipped sheeting right basically it's like strapping a roof with spacing between it so the air could get underneath the roof shingles and dry I'm from underneath and from the sun up top\nA wood roof is like a wooden boat it has to get saturated with water as well tied to the joint and then it becomes waterproof the shingle itself is actually wet\nAnd if it's laying on cheating without any air on there it it rots from the underside out yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Money Pit", "city": "Florence", "day": "20"}
