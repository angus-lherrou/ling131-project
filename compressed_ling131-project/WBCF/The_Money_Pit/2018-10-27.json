he did eight six six six three nine seven four Leslie whose first\nJames and George is on the line with a new home that come in with I think he spent tell us what's going on\nJust got home that had obviously been smoked in not only cigarettes cigars from the previous or and yet it is it is horrible you know and you know like my teenager just kind of sick even being in there so you know we're going to do slot remodeled before we moved in any way\nI mean I mean you might be pulled carpet out but other than that I'm I'm kind of at a loss I didn't know dining help\n'em should a clean the duct work or I was kind of ... also like what I could do to get rid of the smell of the\nProblem is that that smoke gets into everything shall we talking about the entire house here or is it just one room\nBono noticed the entire house so in order to really\nClean out that smell you'd have to pull the carpet you could have a clean but I suspect that you know there's still some residual and then once you pull the carpet\nTo figure out what is this connected it sounds like he didn't look something up though [noise] if he rewired these outlets and didn't figure out that they weren't hot to begin with that's a real problem\nWell no he no he didn't really why we are we why the whole out we didn't I took out all\nThe wire and you took all the wire in the house out oh yeah he thought it from scratch all for it in a while\nWell how is it possible you missed this is what I'm not getting when he went in to do the wiring where the walls open did you pull the drywall our ... well yeah yeah\nThey got it and I totally totally ripped everything up pictures there's something I just an old house without any\nWell it all goes anywhere as the whole house you put the drywall and he comes back in ... everything up and he's got a bunch of Dallas there's nothing no power this is his problem okay so you shouldn't he's hitting bottom you shouldn't be paying him twice he screwed this up and needs to come back and fix it or you have to assume or file a complaint against his license\nOn me about his his problem this guy is incompetent and you you shouldn't be paying him to fix his blunders you pay them to wire the whole house you obviously blew it\nAnd I know like ... at the last one you want to and like short cuts in not great work yeah\nYeah exactly I was shocked when he urged Becker

you kidding me I got to pay you for not doing it right\nYeah exactly I think that's your option now if you don't want him to come back then the other thing you do is higher different electrician but

so much calling us an entity money pit that's nuts\nI Know I messed up but\nBut I'd like to be paid for my mistakes that okay [laughter] ...\nWell not fall as in spring you might be finding that between all that patio furniture and a lawn mowers an outdoor equipment and anything else you've got for the warm weather Steve than running a little tight an outside storage shed can be a great solution and also again why project our\nProject but before you began that there are four important things you have to consider and we've got they're kept in today's ... project presented and I hope that their dot com\nNow first the average cost to build the shit is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand it depends on the troops choosing whether you're going to build yourself we're hungry pro but what do you decide to the white or not there are several basic questions need to ask yourself before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permanent I think a lot of people forget and what is my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do this thing I'm going to put up a fan you can't always just go and do that you have to check your\nAnd I'm going to put up a fan you can't always just go and do that you have to check your local building called first to determine if you need a permit to build a shed on your property now you don't want to find out\nAfter you finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building code orange zoning code I mean that's the last thing you want to do it and that's a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what five does your shedding ban what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for just business needs putting nothing then they're not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something decorative\nThere are so many different styles and sizes out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that so you can determine the best style for what your sheds going to be\nYeah and part of that is deciding where the ship is going to go I mean depending on the size of your property you get a lot of different options for the placement that shit now folks very commonly might put it close to the house\nWhich makes running power and water one's easy or sometimes folks will tuck it sort of to the side of the back of the property so that it's less obvious but put some thought into that because you're gonna be going back and forth a lot and you want to regret that decision\nAnd finally what your budget I mean did you go tight budget you could build a very simple should that gets the job done with on a lot of frills but it's got some wiggle room you could think about adding some extra features like integrated shelving inside\nDecorative trim on the outside or you could go all out men came or she shit and maybe electricity cheat swimming\nWall to wall stereo I don't know you know you can really totally decadent those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting estimates from at least two or three contractors before you choose the one pro that's going to help you with the project\nAnd I say it's probably project for them to make their dot com with homemade by there you can get matched with top rated homes service probably in your area we verified reviews and appointments online for free\nNo matter the type of job only ... fast and easy to hire the best ... approach\nNow got Tammy in Philadelphia on the line who is looking for a better shot or how can we have today\nI'm Hi I'm calling because I wanted to find out um I had an older Korean house and I had a a three three three\nI have a back from our our ... and when it's almost finish I Want to second floor and then I'm like a shower or in the water up there on the air for the shower go with coke and I've been ... contractors and my plumber and I'm not getting an answer so I like the remedy that normally model and\nOkay so are you opening up walls is part of remodeling\nYes I Am completely stripped down to the U.S\nOkay great so first of all the reasons you have reduced water pressure an older homes are generally because you are old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they clog the closed down and chemical clogged arteries and then you can't push enough water through it\nAnd that could be your main water pipe that could be the supply pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls or the general rule of thumb is whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um war with pets was different to a newer type of plumbing pipe\nNow the other thing is you have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nOne of the pressure is not that big of a deal because I think the pressure kind of guy and he's just like basically we have to bear arms in the house and you can only use one at a time by the water completely goes ice cold shower somebody comes and eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying the hot water the may not be moving into hot water which I was worried or do you have\nUm forty gallons or with a minimum size but she'll be okay for for two bathrooms okay and is it an older water heater\nUm now I just replace or to hear\nWhen you replace the changing the plumbing around it and this is going through the steel pipes\nThat they changed the hype around the no I don't think\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's contributing the problem and you know with the water pressures of the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something on line called a um a pressure balance now that we're many issue at all\nSo a pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does is it keeps them mixed between hot and cold balance so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and they'll rubble at hot water from the upstairs shower\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of the stream but it wouldn't be\nThe temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not it I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have something you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not getting hot water on the second floor I just don't become moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do is tell them to check the piping around the water heater\nGetting a plumber should know this not only to run the water heater would basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help root syrup help alleviate this guy and if all else fails you could always had a second water heater upstairs you could get into a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it was a ... second for about ...\nOh okay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll right thanks so much for calling

Carlin Maryland on the line welcome to the money what can we help you today\nMy toilet is making a whistling sound a it's a high pitch monotone doesn't do it all the time it starts and stops intermittently I've tracked it down to the word fail is for the water comes in the toilet\nThat what's causing that Carl is the film valve and it's not that unusual condition the we see that a lot we heard about it many times and the reason it happens intermittently is it's somewhat a indicative on the expansion a contraction of those parts and it's going to vary based on the water temperature um but at all\nSince going to vary based on the water temperature um but it also is only going to happen when the toilets reselling\nSo what you should do is simply replace the fill it while you're at

projects to be able to kind of put image rebuild your toilet\nOkay sounds good to know if I might point out something um it does it won the water's not running in the house at all sometimes\nRight and
