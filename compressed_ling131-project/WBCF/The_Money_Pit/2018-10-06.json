all have tests and less cut all that happens every time it rained between at your house okay I like I said I asked anyway so I don't actually know offend Shannon okay in Chicago um [noise] but yeah I mean what we can do about that it's pretty look around us\nSo first of all you mentioned that you're planning to waterproof your basement if you do this right you probably won't have to do any further water preventive your basement because when you're basements could dampen went as a result of rainfall\nIn puddles women around the foundation that is the source of the week so we can try and win the

the bathrooms on your roof there I don't know what to do and listen uh let me ask you\nA question for you but this roof on did you take the old ...\nOh yes of course okay\nNow I'm the old rules did have any ...\nNot really know is your home shady uh yeah some shade or in front of the house yeah you get more strict on the front of them\nAre just you just sit in front of a little bit right right like above the entrance of the door you know ... but I got like a a body shape a typo so\nOne in thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roost she right where the would basically isn't solid contact\nThat's a cooler spot than the average the right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof it's a condition is called ... and it's because you get more condensation\nUh in the areas that are cold near his dinner warms the left and right in it now also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or like in ...\nAnd that can also cost standing on ... or\nSo before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do is use to take a very simple approach as a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget it's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and garden hose onto\nAnd then you could spray the roof down and just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof that has so much moss on and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything wrong time so\nSo last summer when I was painting the fence knew the repairs outside of decided that we take care of that and I got the springs forget and put it on once and then I walked away for about a month\nKnows that almost all that was going to put it on one more time and it's like perfectly clean and put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it doesn't stop the growth performing think of it in a sort of a weed killers or the moss\nAnd it brings the roof and then there's a residual in stays on it and kind of protects the long haul so I Would try or products like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive and see if that doesn't pay and then if it does then you've got to know what you're dealing with\nUm one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down to teach me try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told books a tremendous trees and and that's should just enough weight on it 'cause sunlight is a natural will decide as well so that makes sense\nBy right I'll give it a

apartment\nAnd more like planting flowers is that that they are tiny spiders and that are low spiders and then there's brown fat or that are as big as corners battered I've ever seen a boy\nAnd in the brown spiders ... biggest quarters they sound like brown recluse spiders which can bite so those we don't like it all\nRight but I have tried stuff on lies I've I've tried all kinds of fat out inside my house that I ran out five but impossible to get rid off\nSo I hate to say this but have you considered hiring a professional and he probably stays saving some money but whenever I hear somebody who's buying lots and lots of pesticides spraying it inside the house in the spring and outside the house I'm kind of the opinion that by the time you do all that you've expose yourself to so much\nAccess pesticide that you would have been better off just having a pro come in because they can buy stuff that you can't buy plus they're specifically trained on where to put the insecticide how much deployed and also the insecticides they're very specific and they were moving the insects\nThat they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects\nThat you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation I Would stop shop in Rome pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the house and once you get the populations down to where they are manageable kind of more normal\nThan you could try to use some of those other products just on a maintenance bases that makes sense\nIt sure does but here that here's down the question when everybody
