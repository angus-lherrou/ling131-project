seven eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven that's eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven\n\nNow and the president said Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was proven innocent confirmation battle hey everybody cage Laney America Tonight [noise] divided we saw\nThey say so the midterm elections are going to be interesting I think it's interesting to see what happens in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild few weeks there is no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House and the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court deserve better than a terrible\nPain and suffering and he was forced to endure\nHe said uh for his part Kavanaugh said he would assume the role with gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but ... over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think we're going to see many more protests are going to see some fallout from this or or not\nOne of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins as somebody who\nWas um\nSpot on basically in the wars that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and against such sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact she said because there there were donating ones that are well up over three million dollars I think now that were put out there saying that if she votes yes on Kavanaugh\n... all those credit cards would be process so there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think of our politics has come to the point where people are trying to buy votes them by positions that weren't very sad played she was on sixty minutes when she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began the campaign last month to pressure her she because they knew she was a key swing vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process\nAnd if she voted no like I said the donations wouldn't would be a would not be taken for the donors in the ... the pledges were processed\nSo now\nHowever the main Democrat is in two years they'll get that money that's being raised and it's interesting because calling\nOn friday heading into the we can announced he would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault she said and concerns about threats to roe v Wade with predominantly conservative justice is on the Supreme Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now it's you know over this three million dollar mark like I said and it's still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect on a senator Collins to politics the mob wow wow wow I mean and\nRed spot intensifying I look at that one hundred and ten mile an hour winds and I think now I live there and I'm along that Florida Panhandle I Am gone color meat on\nCars a hundred and eleven miles an hour forget it so making landfall Wednesday afternoon or evening between Pensacola really in the far western panhandle it's looking like just south of Tallahassee the warning is does severe and so worrisome\nThat the Florida State may have cleared the decks Tuesday through friday boom school is closed the university's not open\nBecause of right where that can come Alabama Florida swan e river on there is what we're really looking at even parts of the Mississippi Alabama a border so it could produce some really\nTerrible debris storm surge maybe up to twelve feet in some parts of the Florida coast\nAnd its course and his wife have been declared a state of emergency to get out don't get caught off guard I mean I wouldn't sit on the edge I Would that's what I did these people boarding it up they're smart I mean look you lose a couple of days you come back and that's the worst thing that can happen to you the\nThe ... you know if you're gone you're gone that you can't replace wife and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back and that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it dissipates but boy does not look like at a keep checking that map and it's not is that's\nNot happening this this looks to be very very serious very very serious and then sadly what they're talking about some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm it knock it they're not going to get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that was so crushing and the first place and parts of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility\nIn New York they're not talking about hurricanes are talking about this data limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license dilemma wasn't supposed to be on the road they fail to state inspection at as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including two pedestrians in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown it's outside of\nAlbany New York and his dad these it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and they they're investigating it but the limos slammed into a park S. U. V.\nSo the people inside just killed four sisters died they just bought the limit blew through stop signs slammed into the parked SUV everybody inside was killed and then the two bystanders\nA died as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know these young families young married but in their twenties early thirties\nUm I Can't imagine what they are going to that is how can they shut down this company this this company had um [noise]\nYou know it's crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating nest is the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm a few stint as an undercover informant for the FBI wow and you know what the governor is saying and he's right as they had no business having this on the roadway it failed inspection they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all the things you're supposed to have\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people's lives I mean wow there was a couple that just were married like four months ago ...\nIt's just an unexplainable thing and I like I said I Know that area I Know that area well apply um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nSo that's what the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from ah this past weekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen is the former President George Bush and\nHis daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding or it was just the families in I'm In Maine so Barbara Bush walks down the aisle\nWith her father GW and our wedding so it was too Craig coins who is a screenwriter someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like\nWho is a screenwriter someone\nShe met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend\nAnd released a few pictures you know it was on a social media and what not cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that I'm looking at a happy as can be but um\nNo ... no big announcement snowed giant\nWedding none of that just the um\nPrivate money oh good for them good for them that they pulled it off and it shows yeah time flies she's thirty six years old or has been I guess is thirty seven and she\nCofounded a public health non profit called global\nHealth corps so her sister genna Bush of course they are like I said with her daughter's um\nThat that was just to me that was a cool mom and it was a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how does that that whole sort of understand that things were not telling the mania we're not getting we're going to try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can just have some pictures come out\nAnd they managed to do it which is wow shocking 'cause it's so hard to\nKeep keep anything in secret anymore now he can keep you can't keep the secret\nUm you can't you can't keep people can't keep secrets to just gets out there like poof someone somehow here's something and then before you know it it's um it's out in the cat is out of the bag and that's it ma'am I um\nYou know we're talking about these tariffs on China we're going to talk about that more during the week here on America Tonight but somebody said to nearly ... percent of the people that are getting hit by this besides there's some auto parts and\nYou know what not and I guess one of them is because think of the things that are made in China dollar trade you're going to dollar tree with this ten percent tariffs on this two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nThere's a place where they're getting hit because they're jacking up the prices what do you think for the dollar tree sorry because of the ... it's the five dollar tree now\nFive dollar tree you're still getting a bargain trust me but he they've had to um\nPull things off shelves because of the higher costs\nThey've had to re rack\nA bunch of stuff that is about ten percent of their merchandise which would be thousands of things household\nHealth food hardware electronics all that\nThey cause they'd have to push push it onto the computer or the consumers and if you have things that are between one and they cost for one dollar and the last three or less that doesn't fit with the the door so you can't\nCan't have them on the shelves and like I said five dollar tree is very Confucius say right now there's a terror if he's going to cost you more when you walk in these doors we're renaming this tour temporarily don't blame us [laughter]\nHow's that don't blame us [noise]\nI Do she did too really cool people you don't want to Memphis that's coming up on the flip side\nWith me any here on record\n\n[noise] one easy of radio [noise]\nABC News I'm Dave Schreiber deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein talking with President Trump on Monday on air force one the president's saying about the conversation quote he had a really good dark we actually get along ABC News cheap one else corresponded Jonathan girl\nThe president has been convinced by some of his advisors did firing Rosenstein in the midst of of the midterms will just be a bad move it would it would open them up to all sorts of avenues of attack\nIt would inject another element into the campaign would not be helpful to Republicans but I think there's a little bit more to it than that to the dirty little secret here is that the president actually has a pretty good relationship with Rod Rosenstein certainly a better relationship at this point that he has with his attorney general Jeff Sessions\nWell first of all just look at things object to the fact is every one of us is going to die so there's some basic questions we have to ask why do we die where are we here but\nIt's my purpose in life so if you go back and look at those philosophical questions and then look at the information that's available then you will come to the right conclusion of ... to ... sake\nIt's a very liberal then you will come to the right conclusion of simple way to approach it as a psychotic you real please show me a real ended up doing just out of the sincerity of your heart really does step sample who get complicated but it really is\nRight to say whatever is to show the belief and I think you're at a hundred percent right on that\nNo question and talking about breaking it down ... we're people are and we're the world is headed what's your biggest fear is people down in gray what you're talking about the trench deposed in inverted brain American spiritual I'm Wondering down in price\nBut they are that right to not embrace it but once you believe that some of the main is factual what you believe\nThe truth is the truth because it is the truth it stands the test of time is it going to be true regardless of whether you believe it or not for example the law of gravity you might not believing gravity but you step off the roof of a house you're going to get pulled her out of the gravity exist\nSo boy bands on it all Jews that you should know the truth and the truth show set you free and so and burn rubber America examines a lot of facts objectively so that people can come to the right conclusion as a witness to\nOh I Love that that's a perfect sense that there's no question about what's been the reaction Dr Haley your book with the people you know and now they're even more word is getting out about it what's been the reaction kind of ease patents ... may\nWell a lot of people say oh man this stuff that stimulates should thinking it's true it's controversy oh [laughter] are all kind of you know the controversial questions\nThat popular leaders try the boy everything that's controversial homosexuality same sex marriage women pastors\nAll these type of thing in the Bible addresses that so I didn't write the Bible God wrote it you've created us he knows all about it and he put these things in place for we to function juice I came that you might have life that you might have it more a bond that we\nDo things go way there'll be less stress you're\nGoing to have trials because the righteous suffer through many trials but he's there with us to take us through the trials and we're supposed to make the other people who are not Christians jealous because they're going to see something different about us so that's how it works we live whole each without going to be perfect use all the one that was perfect\nAnd he wasn't kill because he was a senator who was killed for who he was he's a king of the Jews you God and it's like Emmanuel ... with us so\nThat's just a fact people got to deal with it one way or another people don't have to deal with that issue who is Jesus you got to deal with that before you\nOr you leave the service is only two destination\nHeaven or hell I'd like to believe it or not that exists yeah I've done let me let me try to people don't know the actually died back in Ninety four Ninety five at a major heart attack and\nThey were operating on me I came out of my body I'm an operating room looking these doctors work on my body and they wanted a dog so we lost and we lost and I'm no I'm right here I'm trying to get their attention but they didn't see me I'm like no I'm right here right here\nSo that the separation of body soul and spirit is separation is not an elation that some religions teach it separation your your your spirit and so go back to its creator and your body goes to the grave\nAnd so I'm trying to get their attention when the doctor said let's try one more thing 'cause I had flat line and when he tried to add one more thing\nI was put back into my body and woke up in the recovery room so\nWow that is that that is powerful and that is a perfect place to end the doctor Haley thank you so much pick up the book certainly we've gone through reasons why and what is the question and and everyone will die because what is your purpose there's so much to the thank you Dr Hailey\nThanks for having everyone please go live far publishing and just type in invertebrate America and then my book will come up I ... I Believe it's on page\nEleven thank you for having me or the everyone in heaven [laughter] those who believe thanks thanks after Haley thank you [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] when you use public Weinstein\nHackers and identity seasons eat anything you do on line\n... photos your Web history even your passwords that's why I use the Internet access to my Internet connection for less than in the day sign up now is probably the Internet access dot com and in just a few minutes you'll be browsing anonymously\nAnd hearing what you want\nInternet access\nTime to protect your online privacy\nPart related health problems affect millions of people each year maybe you were one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain high blood pressure congestive heart failure unbalanced cholesterol irregular heartbeat or clogged arteries there is a solution that doesn't involve expensive prescription drugs that only mask\nThe problem and leave you with portable signed it back\nIf you are ready to lead your life three of sickness pain and the or live your life with increased by ... ... and youthful mass inexperience your body healing itself I mean you are ready for a hurricane body extract from healthy hearts cloud ... one satisfied customers had to say about heightened body extract regarding here in China pain\nI haven't had any kind of pain since I've been on it so hard body I practice so brave thank God that I Would read product that feeling somewhat from Maine and that can be so much rather ...\nOr your two month supply of hard to body extract today called one eight six six to nine five by three zero by the or do to H.
