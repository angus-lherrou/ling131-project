next day September thirteenth Democrats announced that they had referred the letter to the FBI at this point\nIt doesn't matter it's I think it's about moving forward what does the Senate decide to do you have Jeff Flake who's flaking out from his role in the Senate anyway saying he feels like he doesn't have a party anymore\nYou have I'm Brett Kavanaugh saying he's not going to return to teach at

from the Democrats to confirm him no Democrat has said if they would support him senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are undecided the Senator Jeff flake said he would support cabinet\n... I'm going to kind of ... in a few different directions and the reason I Do that as\nI said this before but there's so much that always happens but we never get to some of it is funny some of the theory is but there's a ton of stuff to talk about and this happened to you where you've been on a highway and you're backed up and it's not an accident you're saying where people doing I mean is or is this something there must be an accent what is it\nAnd I can't tell you since I moved to the south and I've lived all over the country how many times I've been\nSomewhere to only find out that livestock with three then why we were stuck in traffic and I was reading a story about dozens of cows roaming free on the interstate zoning lane and Lana a tractor trailer that was calling them\nA overturned so there was a sixteen hour round up\nOf these two metro counties\nThere was eighty nine cats from Florida's northwest juror or your Georgia easy for me to say one at a tipped over on two eighty five which is huge at the ... I Seventy five interchange in Cobb County some of the animals were trapped in the truck but dozens of others spilled onto the interstate so\nUm they started what do you do or cow and your phrase start to talk of course you would see some of these pictures of cows in the street it was the\nEasiest\nThing and and of course traffic is pretty is pretty bad um so and we're talking in the morning lame lanes were shut down and they started to reopen um maybe by six thirty or so all the lanes were clear but the ramp wasn't one of the major ramps wasn't open to one thirty\nOr the good news is the drivers taking the hospital and they think he's going to be okay but\nI've been I've been\nOn a highway were something spilled out onto the highway and it was cattle\nAnd it back to everything up and I had\nNo idea what it was never to use it all and you start you see these see an animal making its way towards your car and as the as it is it's just the craziest\nThing but of course it happens whatever they're hauling and if you flip and whatever happens to be in gets a build out this is a crazy story and one that I\nWonder when pins get stuck in bowling alleys I hadn't been bowling forever until my nephew came to visit me and we took 'em bowling and that was once a month ago\nBut we have problems resetting the um the machine so the owner of a Southern California bowling alley died after getting stuck in a pinch setting machines\nThey say this is a place that a hundred miles south west of Denver they say he responded to call they responded to a call and they found sixty five year old actor Rodriguez stuck in the machine at Fremont lanes he was unconscious not breathing so somehow\nThat happened who knew they say it's not foul play\nBut\nThe machine to kill him and you just I don't I don't think that it seems like it's coming out you know slowly grabbing depends but whenever it happened it um it it happened\nAnd what a crazy sad stories that I'm not surprised by this you know we do that thing was capes chemicals which by the way that food is great Mahler love that and it's healthy 'cause that's where you start to learn more about dogs I think well didn't they just just to eat whatever but the more you talk to these veterinarians now\nUm so that's why I got healthier food and capes chemical is great you go to ... ... dot com and check it out if you've got a dog 'cause I seriously jumped on us because of that so trust me I order my dog food um there's a new study came out that showed that dogs might be\nMore anxious and possibly suffer from depression when their owners overused their smartphones the United kingdom based study\nFocused on how welcoming a pet specifically a dog could help people suffering from a mental health issues they learned that dogs can suffer from the depression when they're human hampers ignored them\nAnd affiliate veterinarian of course Dr ... a lot of that he saw the effects of smartphone users John pet the dogs are good at reading are subtle cues they read the body language that makes sense they read the facial expressions we're on the phone you're just interested\nThey want attention and they're not getting attention because you're focused on the phone\nAnd I've seen that actually with my hollow who gets frustrated because he doesn't get his attention he's not he he he likes attention but I think the whole something gets on his nerves and then actually\nAnd of course you know phone the phone as a work tool and I'm you know fifty fifty about it but\nI was um\nJust recently I had the phone and maybe a couple of weeks ago I had him so and I was texting I I think my nephew\nHad the phone and maybe a couple of weeks ago I had a\nThought I was texting I I think my nephew and somebody else and he wanted attention he came up any not to sign out of my hand so if it's a smart dog maybe it'll do that too\n[noise] one thing that would never happen with my my hollow is he would not be on an airplane the FAA rules on an airplane\nOr the size they're saying because remember there's this big hubbub about these seats in the side but the thing that might not create more leg room or any of that for the fires and say they're crafts there's a bill is going to regulate minimum the side on passenger planes\nAnd they took it up on Monday it's you know because this reauthorization bill\nThe F a a reauthorization bill fund the agency for five years ... other travel measures today the current rules say airlines must be able to evacuate passengers within Ninety seconds of an emergency but they don't set the requirements or on the size of the space\nBetween other seats if passed would require minimum standard based on a safety review\n...\nIsn't that interesting so you wonder they say frontier airlines is the tightest twenty eight inches the average for economy seats thirty one inches\nAnd I'm\nCurrently he touched the distance from one seat back to the next seat on low cost carriers is that is what I said at the tightest but um\nI don't know it's it seems to me no matter where you are right depends on\nIt depends on how much stuff the people around you have it depends on what kind of\nA a lot of different factors I think but I I guess the actual pitch like I said between the seeds that one thing I'll tell you a funny story one time and this was years and years ago I was on a plane it was packed it was a holiday plane going back\nTo Philadelphia from Dallas and stopping in Chicago O'Hare\nAnd getting to a hair 'cause that's going to be crazy scene there and then it was picking up people and jamming on it and so Smith flight until the guy the guy next to me is talking to me a little bit and I'm the guy in front of me\nLeather seats go back in his seat just live at I mean it was just that he was like practically my lap and the guy\nThe guy sitting next to me they don't like it and he said excuse me I think you need to put your stand up and he said no I'm just like you do you put your seat back and he took the hardcover book I had like a hardcover book he took the book out of my hands and he hit the guy on the head and I thought [noise]\nAfter nine eleven you don't see that stuff right\nBecause they're going to land the plane and none of us are going to get back there's going to be no Christmas let alone a white Christmas if you do that and it was it was pretty freaky but luckily we got it under control and they did not do that because I was really really thought that's what we were going to say\nThat that was going to happen that we were going to end up landing this plane somewhere so I don't know there is something about the state we like our space\nAnd we don't get that much based on the plane and that is very very true\nMusic means
