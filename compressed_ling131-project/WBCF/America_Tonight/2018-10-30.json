itself and we love not have fortunately\nThis anti Semitic ... of this crazy deranged man killing a loving people and injuring ... others in a synagogue is just so over the top and it's taken people a few days even wrap their minds around what's happened and the outpouring\nOf support naturally not a surprise for the people from the tree of life synagogue and the people of Pittsburgh has been phenomenal uh Pittsburgh rabbi talks about the massacre on America in to tack and that\nSure you know that synagogue a rabbi Jeffrey Maier said while American citizens can't freely and safely worship in their house of worship and celebrate the Sabbath\nIt concerns me because it challenges the safety and security of all Americans in any house of worship and yes it's very\nTroubling so it is very troubling edited the conversation that needs to be had\nWhen we're talking about how do we protect the people who go to worship in any form of worship Myers by the way it was starting services Saturday morning when the gunman burst in\nAnd this Robert\n... ours is the gunmen burst into the Pittsburgh capitals shooting the people and screaming anti Semitic statements and just picked off the people that were ... soft targets so\nThree women eight men from the age of fifty for two Ninety seven were killed including two brothers he's being held this rabbi as sort of a hero definitely hero for saving a lot of his congregants\nBut he said you know don't call me a hero and he said he's coping badly with the trauma and he regrets he couldn't said more people and of course that's how he would feel I mean\nYou know he also said he's not sure if the shooter can be forgiven cause the wounds are to open to answer that kind of question when he's been asked that and can you really for give everybody\nA for all evil you know that's one of the big\nQuestions that you try to answer a\nWhen it comes to religion and theology obviously as religion but ah in trying to answer that question so I think\nSynagogues or on high alert churches are higher on high alert we've seen churches where people have been killed as well and a lot of times the policy that moving forward is adopted as we have to have somebody arms we have to have guards we have to protect\nThe the flock and we don't wish we didn't have to do this but we do and this is the way we we live now so we'll have to accept that that's what we do moving forward I don't know that everybody will embrace that I think it's the discussion that things\nHad been happening right now across America a next week is another week of services across the land\nAnd will there be more churches synagogues other places of worship where you'll find that some people are armed in the meantime there was another hate crime or hate crime being considered any way and it's happened in the a Kroger and this was in the south\nYou get to the content there or you go to the G than website and you can also get it there too as\nWell but um that's terrific and the other thing is my I haven't talked a lot about it but my\nMy book is coming out because people ask about the story was loose story but the story with lessons because he wants to just hear about me and what about what it related how can relate to you so my book is called deal your own destiny it's by Forbes\nFor his book produced it published it increase your odds when big and become extraordinary it's on Amazon pre sale right now but it's a it drops on the nights so under the ... the book\nDeal your own destiny drops and I'm excited about that and I'll tell you more about that as you know we move along here on the show I so let's talk about the big headlines in the big headlines really are focusing on the mid term elections\nBecause we're getting closer to that that is that is right around the corner there are some hot races there are a\nLot of people it seems doing their early voting but I think it depends on where you live and a lot of times we think that but then we see the numbers and they're not necessarily high much higher in a presidential year\nAnd here we're grief stricken ever Pittsburgh stories about that the funerals and\nThat the first lady and the president are going to be there on Tuesday and of course there is concern about security but I think when you're the leader of the free world you need to be there I think it's smart to go so then the conversation is about the trauma afterwards and the lives lost that tree of life\nAnd struggling with hate speech tied to that and\nWhat is it all means and uh know frankly and the Jewish community this kind of divide over Donald Trump lots of support for him and then not support but that's pretty much how it is in this country we're polarized nation across the board when it comes to politics\nI think the big takeaway from\nSquirrel hills which is the suburb where this synagogue was is\nThat\nLove is stronger than hate but when you go into a place of worship view are vulnerable you're a soft target end the conversation has to go toward\nDo you need to guard do you need somebody armed how do you deal with that potential threat which may never happened and hopefully never ever happens but\nCan we now say we know what could happen next and the answer is you just never know the other question is are we going to see any kind of a clash at the border eventually\nAh the deployment of fifty two hundred additional troops to the Mexican border with the caravan from Central America making its way through Mexico toward the United states\nWe're still away away from that\nWhile that happens there is also um and the scramble for votes going on with the mid term elections there is the scramble over what's going on with the stock market\nAnd tech stocks are dragging down I think a lot of other stocks so Monday battered again the Dow Jones was down a slung more than nine hundred points from three fifty up to five hundred negatively wiped out gains that whole thing\nThe Dow closed down about two hundred and fifty points has kind of bouncing all around and you look at the the issues China Russia emerging markets uncertainty of policy in and when it comes to that ah terrorists news\nTech stocks being off all of that higher interest rates even apple you think of people lining up to get the latest greatest apple\nPhone every year it's it's like a must have for people to apple shares are down ... points fifty four percent from their massive high\nYou know you just think of apple winter or just massive I should have got an apple when I had two dollars in my pocket but no now it's down and Google is down almost twenty percent from its high so a lot of um tech stock also taking a beating\nAnd part of that is because there were reports that England plants tax Facebook and Google revenue two percent in that country they hadn't done that before so then that sends the market toppling\nI said it before I'll say it again and kitsch never heard of the show listen you're at the crap stable when it comes to the markets when it comes to investments we all know that\nUm it doesn't take a genius to realize that or you know it's like it's like anything that you invest in you get the the shore and says you think you do your homework you look at it but then something can wipe it out so the key idea is to keep your eye on it and not ...\nAnd if something can wipe it out so the key idea is to keep your eye on it and not walk away from it I think that's what happens\nSomething balloons you get excited and then you kind of move away from it because you're on to do in life and other things and you're not checking closely on it check it every day and look and see where that stocks going\nAnd what you need to do I'm not a stockbroker advising you I'm just giving you my two cents on the right way to ride that kind of thing instead of waiting until pool\nBoy well can I Do of course\nWhen you're talking about a four O. one K. which is awesome if you have a four one K. you pick a basket of stocks in the beginning of the year when the entry point is and then usually it can't maneuver that too much or if you're retired you can you got to pay attention to what it is you have\nChecked for stocks of did it as it would be my only advice if you have a nice healthy dividend that certainly helps this is a sad story eighty a hundred and eighty nine people on a brand new Boeing jet\nThat was operated by lying aircraft and they're pulling unfortunately mangled body parts out of the the ...\nUm no explanation for what happened it happened shortly after take off this guy was clear and\nThe selling seven thirty seven hadn't been in service for a couple of months had flown eight hundred hours the pilots asked to return to the airport after they took off\nRequests was cleared but the plane then lost contact and launched into the the oh my gosh till who knows a their findings ID card and you know all kinds of things that you can imagine and they're trying to identify people very rough for anybody who knew somebody on that\nFlight or Fifteen ships are looking for the main section and the victims you know the um three hundred rescuers have been deployed from search and rescue\nThirty divers in the water trying to get the fuselage for black box is always the big concern there looking with robots and sonar technology and\nIndonesia is actually one of the fastest growing aviation markets especially in that air area because air travel is a necessity to go to the other areas near it\nBut it's kind of mix when it comes to safety you know member um planes were banned from flying to the United states in two thousand and seven because they were deficient in a couple of different areas like technical expertise\nPeace rather trains people trained personnel record keeping inspection procedures but that makes you feel safe right wanting to get on one of those planes not really and lie in the air is the largest budget airlines fifty percent of the market they\nControl so there's plenty of people that would jump on that plane that's what they take in flying to different Iowans different different areas of you know Indonesia where they're going where they were going and I'm going to Kuala Lumpur or any of those other spots and\nHis getting that phone call and you know realizing who's on that flight and all that kind of thing I mean that's why they're spring\nTo identify people as fast as they can start you want to hang with us don't forget about to nail the Gore Wednesday and Thursday our last segment of that first hour you want to be a part of it you might be a winner winter winter [noise] he kinda flip side [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] talk on the sea of radio [noise]\nABC News I'm Dave Schreiber as the president and first lady repair to visit Pittsburgh his visit as being met with mixed reviews ABC's cheap one else corresponded jumping girl\nWell there's one progressive Jewish group in Pittsburgh saying the president's not welcome until he fully denounces white supremacy the response to that the White House or the president has repeatedly denounced bigotry and racism in all forms\nAnd Sarah Sanders said the president is going to Pittsburgh to show support for the Jewish community and she pointed out that the rabbi from the tree of life synagogue has said that he is welcome\nThey be seized chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl a strong but deep earthquake that struck New Zealand north Arlen conjuring the nation's parliament it'd be briefly suspended as a precaution no immediate reports of damage or injuries the magnitude six point one quake struck Tuesday Afternoon\nWell first of all just look at things objectively effective every one of us is going to die\nSo there's some basic questions we have to ask why do we die where are we here what is my purpose in life so if you go back and look at some does philosophical questions and then look at the information that's available then you will come to the right conclusion of ...\nAt the information that's available then you will come to the right conclusion of ... to ... sake God if\nYou're real please show me a real ended up doing just out of the sincerity of your heart really just a sample we get complicated but it really is\nRight to say whatever is to show the belief and I think you're at a hundred percent right on that no question and talking about breaking it down now where people are and we're\nThe world had once your biggest fear is people down in great what you're talking about the principles in invertebrate American spiritual I'm Wondering down in price\nBut they have that right to not embrace it but once you believe doesn't necessarily mean is factual what you believe\nThe truth is the truth because it is the truth it stands the test of time is it going to be true regardless of whether you believe it or not for example the law of gravity you might not believing gravity but you step off the roof of a house you're going to get pulled to the earth gravity exist\nSo boy bands on it all Jews that you should know the truth and the truth show set you free and so and burn up America examines a lot of facts objectively so that people can come to the right conclusion as a witness into\nOh I Love that that's the perfect sentiment there's no question about what's been the reaction Dr Haley your book with the people you know and now they're even more word is getting out about it that's been the reaction enemy ... may\nWell a lot of people say oh man this stuff that stimulates should thinking it's true it's controversy oh [laughter] are all kind of you know the controversial questions\nThat popular leaders try to avoid everything that's controversial homosexuality same sex marriage women past there's all these type of thing to Bible addresses that so I didn't write the Bible God wrote it\nHe created us he knows all about it and he put these things in place for we to function Jesus I came that you might have life that you might have it more a bonding\nWe do things that go way there'll be less stress you're going to have trials because the righteous just suffer through many trials but he did there with us to take us through the trial and we're supposed to make the other people who are not Christian jealous because they're going to see something different about us so that's how it works we live whole each without\nGoing to be perfect uses all the one that was perfect and he wasn't kill 'cause he was a senator who was killed for who he was he was a king and the Jews you God in ... so\nThat's just the fact that people got to deal with it one way or another people go out to deal with that issue who is Jesus you got to deal with that before you or you leave the service is only two destination heaven or hell\nI Believe it or not that exists yeah I've done I mean let me share that people don't know the actually died back in Ninety four and five at a major\nHeart attack and while they were operating on me I came out of my body among the operating room looking these doctors work on my body and they wanted to talk so we lost and we lost and I'm no I'm right here I'm trying to get their attention but they didn't see me I'm like no I'm right here right here\nSo that the separation of body soul and spirit is separation is not an ... and has some religions teach it's separation your your your spirit and so go back to its creator and your body goes to the grave\nAnd so I'm trying to get their attention on a doctor said let's try one more thing 'cause I had flat line\nAnd when he tried to have one more thing I was put back into my body and I woke up in the recovery room\nAllow that is that that is powerful and that is a perfect place to end that Dr Kelly thank you so much of the book certainly we've gone through reasons why and what is the question and and everyone will die ... what is your there's so much just to thank you Dr Hailey\nThanks for having everyone please go to live fire publishing and just type in invertebrate America and then my book will come up I ...
