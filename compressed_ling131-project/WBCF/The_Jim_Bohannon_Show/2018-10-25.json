subtitled the thrills chills screams with occasional blackouts\nOf an extraordinary presidents I Love the prologue here what I should have learned in your lead off with this quote major\nFantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you\nKnow that he's actually right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nUh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics\nYou know audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as\nA full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that our audience can feel and touching relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate that you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional and experience\nAnd been around the the ... I certainly have been you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability\nSo that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give the listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd said to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I only taken the time\nTo look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that super high level of psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how is he coming at you\nI Would have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to the very first sentence\nAnd one example of it major fantastic what is that about\nWell it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of reporters covering its press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me\nIt was about you're here you're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic that Trump\nI should have learned to paid attention to what he was telling me what what that those two words actually mean and the sense as I say in the book of al ... exuberance\nThat is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world ... exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I say to myself they're all sorts of these great clues\nThat Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and if I had taken more time been more curious about\nThis different kinds of political actor and has different ways of dealing with language I'd have learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of crack this lock well with\nAll due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you've covered\nAh let's see for presidents these for three news outlets\nYeah let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for it I don't know I mean let let's let's just do you look at the at the the circumstances of this man I I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president but\nNot even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that he is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he\nHad some recognition for his General Electric uh sponsored radio\nEditorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes\nAnd he was a completely different actor and different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game and I write early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black\nOr that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those uptight parents who want to\nUm school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump and his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents saying don't you know the rules why aren't you following the rules and why can't you\nA color but in the inside the lines I Know that sort of thing and it's a while to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what the lines are different he's drawing them\nAnd look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nYou know we're going to have to pause on that note I'm going to come back what they look at how some other Republicans learned these lessons with major Garrett in a moment\n\nTalk sports Ninety seven one F.

Missouri to like a good evening Patrick into welcome to the program\nA local ... thanks dang a major Garrett for writing such a good book and you know actually he needs somebody to tell the truth but I really think if if anybody takes a look at these bombings it's awful convenient that all the people that are being investigated\nOver this current corruption received a bomb\nAnd none of them went off and now the FBI almost completely stopped that would imagine investigating them and it's running around trying to find out who said he bombs that thank you and it happens right before the election plus it takes the heat off the convoy coming up through Mexico\nOh I well let's let our guests comment about to all of those various factors if it has momentarily are taking the attention away from

same time I think you can continue and it was doing go ahead\nAnd and the caravans going to remain a story and remember it's ... if it remains on its current course is not going to arrive if it ever does at the U.S border for weeks after the election they're long long way away but the government's going to be a story it it that's not going away and the FBI has lots of different\nParts of it agencies within the agency and it can and does\nI assure you walk chew gum and do a lot of other things far more complicated than those two things on a day to day in our our bases and yes it's a high priority case\nBut the people who work at work those kinds of cases they don't necessarily or even generally work government corruption cases it's not as if everything the FBI was working on suddenly stops and everyone\nLiterally goes and runs in this direction that's not how the agency operates these things work methodically across the agency they will continue to work but what I think the

chapter your daughter\nSo I'm One of the things that I Hope listeners gained from our conversation demos is that the answer to this question do we really need another Trump book which is not an unfair question and I would say in this sense we do why\nBecause we need a book about and that's the reason I wrote it and it was difficult to do while I was doing my day job don't think it was in a book about what's actually happened what\nDecisions have been made what\nIf you want to call on this and the White House certainly does what series of accomplishments of occurred in the first Eighteen months and whether you think of them as accomplishments or not things did happen they're likely going to be with this country to five ten Twenty years from now one of the things that is with us is this dramatic shift\nCarried out by president elect Trump there was a good offices of Jared Kushner his son in law during the transition\nTo start a relationship with the Saudi regime and fundamentally alter America's approach to that kingdom in that geopolitical read region shift away from Iran shift away from the Iran nuclear deal\nAnd create a different access if you will in the region which is the United states surprisingly Israel and the Saudis to be a counterweight to Iran\nAnd so much of U.S policy in the middle east was\nPredicated on that and has followed that track set in motion and detail how during the transition by these early interactions if you want to think of this way or the two young princes Jared Kushner\nAnd the Trump Administration crown prince Mohammed bin some on the de facto leader and Arab parent in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and their interactions and their trust in one another was foundational\nTo this emerging Rio orientation of the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and\nA long time ago summer of last year\nWhen the White House was more inclined to cooperate on books like mind Jared and I had a long conversation about this which is on the record in my book you don't find very many on the record lengthy conversations with Jared Kushner about any top many topics almost none on this topic so if you're curious about how this all got started and what that perspective is\nI I recommend the book to you because you could actually find out in Jared Kushner's words what they're trying to accomplish what their initial hopes were\nAnd certainly the jump off the show he case brings many of those hopes\nAnd aspirations into a harsher and more difficult light\nBriefly or do you find the fact that this was his first foreign visit is to be significant\nI Do and that's why I developed an entire chapter to it not that it's going to change everything are all the orientations that Trump brings to Middle Eastern policy of going to be successful but they're ... they're dramatically different and there are different this key respect\nPresident Trump said there is Saudi Arabia in Riyadh were not going to interfere with your internal
