they might look like outsiders when really their insiders and we talk about Russia all day long I asked her\nWell let me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up a is there any such international body there is of course the world courts and there are various ah\nAh bodies of the United nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but don't end up at best and the\nAnd the hospital to U.S interests that red worst but I I Am curious if such a pug bodies even exist usually law and regulation trailed far behind technology especially in this day and age\nNow you're exactly right and it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because there's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm as pious plan to suit the side of how we all get along come by ah I I don't want this weapon given\nTo anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and groups tank I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I I always thought the United states should a control most of the still\nAnd and we're

real solution is going to be technological yeah I Would\nHave to think so as regards what you just said by the way this notion of vote will papers out so twentieth century well you know what is there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that were better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point if for example\nAh it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hack and and also the outcome well thank goodness for that\nI personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail right there of how people voted\nIf somebody ... something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant and uh I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or luddite well boo hoo\nWell we we do have short attention span of a sure don't like the way for people that counts I don't want it to the ... the bath water ON Technology there shouldn't be\nBut but there there is got to be something
