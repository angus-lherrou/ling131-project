Congress\nAnd the doctor Michael ... is our guest is a public policy analyst in reverse or of finance at Stockton University and\nA lot of what we've been saying here I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies\nThe less likely is to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't work things out so well so I think I'm probably most surprised about is\nThat we worked out this deal with by far the weaker less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first and it's the Canadians who was economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would address my theory of professor you may give me an a through an ethanol take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nWell let me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless that less than developed country has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance\nI suppose the uh and here's the example I use on my classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs a week and they need coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing we we have the right climate for it we use small amount of resources get a large amount of wheat were not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate for it we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like Columbia let's say in South America is just the opposite\nThey don't have the climate or to grow wheat nor the the know how do they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great climate for growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say\nSuppose the U. S. specializes in making just we were going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we\nBoth countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources\nDo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just weak anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go make we\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens is the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else\nBut they say we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make dairy products\nFor and that's what the Rob is with with Canada All right to a call from Sharon in crane Missouri yeah good evening sharing\nThat evening can and not ... ...

Michael butler from Stockton University a professor of finance there and also a public policy analyst and we're looking at the new proposed a trade deal again it's not a done deal yet it has to get congressional approval\nBut uh it I suppose it is not a stretch to assume that even a badly divided Congress\nWould be able to say yes to a fair amount of what is in this\nLet's talk to David who calls in from San Francisco tonight to David good evening\nJim up in your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major of financial problems\nDirectly tied to this Chinese steel and uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just a fabulously sort of five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge road\nRight yeah and in fact if you remember just the dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in costs and six billion and financing so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken bridge and I was defective when it when it opened\n... are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel\nOh yeah and what was going well I didn't know that yeah what was significant about it Arnold was the governor and this crush wants them to right okay yeah\nOr was the Republican governor and little brown was the former mayor\nThe two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely custom\nAnd the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nAre you know each park had to have an inspector massive art ... almost to the to the mayor and they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\nThat that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite huh\nRight to override it ... that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the uh the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact I I guess the professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nBut uh uh current in Rochester, Minnesota is a next step below courage\nI you know the thing that bothers me about the uh the steel\nFrom China is if you drive a car a lot and you have to have your brakes three done you may have found out over the last Twenty years but you can't turn a realtor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them\nBut nowadays everybody has to you throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel may be cheaper but the quality is also cheaper\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about there'll be led to calls regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom at Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the mice was brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor or but does something like this is well I mean a indicates will break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe you will die or is that the other problem\nIn trading with the Chinese the question of qualities you'd do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue of products like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially you're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause a severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer products look at the textile industry so if I'm the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars\nWell they decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are\nAt the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so well that some people would say that's a very positive thing\nUh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can purchase much more goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept of course those workers were out of work who can't afford anything at all I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy's strictly around consumers uh that that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the twenties sixteen presidential election\nThat's right uh so uh up until Donald Trump they they thought was well\nLook let's try to get these products that consumers that the lowest possible price even if you have to sacrifice a low quality get it at the lowest possible price that means consumers will be able to buy more things\nDon bowed out for a motel six and will lead the light on for

Bush\nEvery American is saying the shocking images from Somalia\nThe scope of suffering there it's hard to imagine already over a quarter million people given died in the Somali than\nIn the months ahead five times that number one and a half million people could starve to death there is no government in Somalia law and order him broken down anarchy prevails I have given the order to move a substantial American force into Somalia\nPurpose for being there was to respond to any requirements to the was the most or by the U.N mission\nOn three October we got the call\nAnd what prompted the call was helicopter got shut down\n[laughter] [noise]\nOh\nI didn't know that though\nI didn't know one of them by now\nBut they weren't American so [noise]\nThat same uniform I\nAnd we weren't going on without\nPlan we came up with was to ask the Malaysian to remove their infantry soldiers\nFrom their vehicles re so that we could use them\nWere staging tanks and armored personnel carriers for your company\nWere staging tanks and armored personnel carriers for your company to go in that we never even been in before\nWe got in these things and and you can speak the drivers and speak to us and it's really hard to describe it as the complexity of what was going on because my definition when you say quick reaction force you're basically saying things\nThings are going to hell plan was created which is no long to assist the rangers\nRescued rangers\nEven going in with a force like that\nIt just seemed like you know\nThis is going to be a different game\nPage publishing look at your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright and editing ... eight hundred vines zero one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author sufficient get that's eight hundred fines or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred buys zero one thirty six eighty nine\nThe national debt is now over ... trillion dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nCall eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now any five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold i._r._a. guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on a ... we've covered I talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nUnder it and I finally ... ... [noise]\nOn the\nBack of the jungle and the show as we're talking tonight about the incredible turn of events that occurred in Mogadishu Somalia twenty five years ago I barely a nation except in name in it disintegrated into chaos\nIt was a well meaning motivation as you heard from the beginning of that trailer about this new documentary [noise]\nUh but nonetheless\nAs they say about the road to hell it is often paved with good intentions we're talking with a couple of a veterans of that particular conflict\nRetired brigadier general build David\nAnd a retired lieutenant colonel Michael L. or a beep and also another military veteran retired air force colonel\nRandy Larson the executive producer and director of this new documentary film a since it was brought up I think that it's it's a good perhaps time for you to inject this before we returned to the other two guests are Randy and that would be\nA of the uh a bureaucracy ... through which you had to bludgeon your way or how how serious was that I mean uh did you receive a lack of cooperation or did you see of outright opposition to what you're telling\nYou know there was no opposition but trying to put a documentary film together is is that a nine month\nIt's a marathon but at the at the base in the spring and wanting to get the facts right\nAnd we as a lot of different ... ... ... and ... and ... now but one of the most important things and the stories you know all the military leave the u._s. troops are simpler by George Herbert Walker Bush because people are starving to death in ... in the main impact at five months\nSo we had to send troops over there and what they're for humanitarian reasons and then it turned into an incredible fight\nBut all senior military leaders in that show that the man said we need some armored vehicles over there are groups get in trouble she limb one case and Bradley fighting vehicle protect them from the type of weapons the Somali a rebel hat\nAnd secretary defiance laugh at me and said no we're not going to send them so when general Dave ... who was colonel Simon and and and and ... he was a major like\nWhen they had to go out there and rescue those rangers at the helicopters got shot down\nThey had to go get the ladies in armored personnel carriers\nTrump's outlive us troops in there the U.S troops couldn't speak the Malaysian\nIt's night there's this incredible fight going on I Can't even imagine what that must have been light and so as I've been doing this research I mean I was so impressed with everybody from the AFC about corporal\n... and CEOs who are incredible the senior and you know and and the leaders like a a bill David my ... and that these should really be talking through here because\nFirst of all we should never put American troops in that position where we tell them here's a mission to go do what what you're not going to give you the resource that you say you need it\nYou tell them here's a mission to go do what what you're not going to give you the resource that you say you need and and but I I'm just so proud that we get the honor the ... Mountain Division here on the twenty fifth anniversary\nWell I certainly would concur with you entirely I remember at the time although not realizing the extent to which was true but at the time uh when I was still I was doing this program as a matter of fact it's been a long uh but I remember\nA severely castigated a defense secretary Les Aspen for worrying about cosmetics about whether or not and and then one tank would make us look less like a peacekeeping mission at the time I thought you know the images is baloney uh although I was using stronger language and that but let's talk to a\nA General David ... about that that part of this or that\nIn retrospect what'd you say that you that you were sent into combat would end which is what it was it what it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that they should have been made available to you\nWell I I think a commander with a with always want more resources but I think the\nUm\nOfficers who were in command positions senior to me made it very clear to the national command authority is that um\nArmored vehicles were required for survivor ability and um I ... we protect our force so yes obviously um [noise]\nYou know the more armor you're going to have around your anytime she was pretty good thing so um yeah we we certainly could have used it but we didn't have it on the situation dictated that will use what we had and so that's what we do\nThat is true and and write full of guilt please continue ran in the U.S\nYou know I just want to build David my that would be went into the gunfight that night in a hungry an armored Humvees and light might that in the trailer it's like going in you know in a convertible Corvette and a parade everybody shooting at and they were in on armored on be more than a thousand people\nAnd we all recall what happens do armored Humvees when they get hit with let's say ... and and uh ...\nUh it it was I assume common knowledge to everyone back then that among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time were those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades or certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee or\nRight [noise] well I think that's true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and in the ... protects humanitarian assistance operations that were designed to feed the starving Somalis are I don't think anybody anticipated\nI'm going and into a firefight I think part of that was a lack of recognition and in in my own over the last twenty five years that a lot of time to think about it\nWhen we we have this term called peacekeeping operations in Vermont perspective there's another peaceful about those kinds of operations\nIn this case you had a set of ... you had to drive about having a beer\nYou brought the un and the un became a third drive by the power who was the uh the the thing that had the most value they're fighting for that\nAnd I'm In it escalated I mean there were things that are Kurt back in June and July well the obvious raid and I don't think the folks at home recognize that there was a firefight\nOr until we got the three were up and so\nI think a lot of the calls for armor ... we're not consistent with the information that was coming out of theater with regard to what was going on\nBut maybe not to the general public I Would have to think the defense secretary Aspen had that information\n\nI think that's probably true ah but I'm not sure that you have the ability and I can't really speak for was asking I mean I I can only tell you the perspective that the folks that I was around on the ground had at the time\nAnd that was that generally speaking a there was a very little information that was flowing out of Somalia back to uh either D.C or or back to to ah to centcom to indicate what was really going on in theater so I don't I'm not sure anybody really understood\nHow many firefights we'd already been in prior to the third and fourth of October\nFair enough where to pause briefly will come back with some more one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six by both by four six to six we'll be back in just a moment\nHughes talk sports Ninety seven one FM W.
