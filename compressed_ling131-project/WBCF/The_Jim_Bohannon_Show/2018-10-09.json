com and we're taking a look at\nThings that are might possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance the MEK scenario of course where there have been many many resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in from Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\nHow are you doing Mr Bannon I'm fine thank you\n[noise] um I was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is\nHow the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the um you know people get ... you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and it's not some halfway you know a ...\nA you know the Democrats are an absolute fit but we the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there they\nThe party of appeasement and they need some on this got some fight and then in just says no or we're going to fight for this\nCan we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated Kevin that'd be despicable and either party however why don't we ever fight fight they put up\nYeah well that's a that's a good point of what our guest to address it I I certainly agree with the Charles uh absolutely yeah Dave in regard to the notion of the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up by a liberal justice will you start coming up with the stories about how they uh\nThey uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is is droves voted a disgusting practice [noise]\nBut uh I was wondering uh have\nRepublicans fought hard enough\nRegarding some of the more liberal a recent pick say for example a Brock Obama's pick some of which I I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim it's the president's choice when it's a nominee as qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim\nUh I disagree with that person therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republican credit follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue and and the the or a collegial bunch of people which I'm not too sure that pays off\nThey they are a collegial\nBunch of people which I'm not too sure that pays off anymore college or being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember\nBack when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff in American government and and you know I and some good teachers back then people who weren't really afraid to ah to speak out call a spade a spade and say look you know people do this but this wrong it's not the government is supposed to work\nNowadays a ... it's almost like a a a\nPitch battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to a British Cabinet or the Democrats are with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up the um the the Ford\nAccusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the bus to fit the dogs the ... just in order to uh to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nUh they were both views and it would probably be who the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public a what we witnessed with a judge cab metal justice Cabot all the was just deplorable if not despicable\nAnd uh you know I wrote about this I've covered this thing for liberty per person the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and and certainly the polls seem to be indicating that to the public is just oiled up this really has fired up the Republican base I think\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim they're angry and and they have some people that they were angry at they can identify the people that they're really mad at me and I kinda think the Democrats from the they might have blown this\nOne well we'll see certainly both bases seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turn a trick the best Sharon in grain Missouri hello\nIt's very very um you know whole justice Kavanaugh\nIs about the constitution that but I Want to get today I Want to make I don't why fan too and ah the academic than the court I why ... pilot that kind of tension\nAnd sometimes I'm not going to be happy with that although it may go against something that I think that it in context dictation man I Will I Will abide by that support it I hired\nA\nCork a ... law than they are not supposed to do that that is kind of a job that I Want everybody could do their job Congress to do their job presidents their their guy and they did they show branch to do their\nJob and for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh Sharon and I'll just notice to today as well you look at the constitution that information constitution\nOf the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe president seeded the chief executive officers the cabin and heads and the like and then you come of course to the article three the or the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior records as weak Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the disc records are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also know if you if you study the laws really will judges are on the lower federal courts\nIn and there's even been some mention nothing but ... in New York they added that is the liberal democratic congressman go ahead yeah and ... he's a parent Lee already talking about a trend to I'm a\nRecall or get rid of just his cabinet oh you only do that by impeaching him convicted I Know and and didn't just\nYou know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the D side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\n[laughter] no I'm I'm sure they don't and I'm sure this appeals to the base which increasingly has a has Democrats rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house he has a ... vote articles of impeachment against Donald Trump and possibly Kevin ... they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I'm going to lose

being a Columbus Day a federal holiday or this was what ... going back to the D.C versus Heller\nA decision and this is what the judge Kavanaugh had to say in the twenty eleven\nAnd and I'm quoting here from a cabinet position and disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry a felon in possession laws\nHeller established that the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans on regulation is determined by reference to text history and tradition\nUnquote Brett Kavanaugh as an appellate court judge seven years ago or your your thoughts about that as a as a a philosophy going forward Dave\n[noise] well I think that is one of the keys to white Dianne Feinstein and some colleagues were just going [laughter]\nAnd Feinstein and some colleagues were just going berserk or the idea of a cabinet or sending to the Supreme Court ah I think he looks at the historic\nA way that firearms have really been a\nPart of the American fabric but you know we talked earlier about a a law enforcement and and how the country didn't really have a law enforcement until the early Eighteen hundreds and I checked the Texas Rangers\nWere formed Eighteen twenty three places Austin alright um\nThe the idea that ah when the constitution was written\nA it was commonplace for people walk around in the village they they'd go to trade they do think they had a fire or whether it might have been a a Flynn lock or or briefs of pistols or something but they had guns with them\nEverybody behaved ... most people behave themselves and\nUh I think he looks at the historic context of how fire which were were really part of the ... the American fabric and and how we advance as a country he also said something in in that ruling into this little living that\nBecause semi automatic pistols or protect her so also should be semi automatic rifles\nAnd you know that's in some of the Democrats into orbit\nYeah but I Would say they'll try it out the terms that they could define that their lives depend on what about assault rifles and now I can defining assault rifle for you right now and that is it's a it's black and sinister looking it may have a pistol grip that that's an assault rifle go ahead\nWell uh yeah I think you just paint that because quite frankly\nThe term is an invention by the the the gun prohibition lobby and you know they this dates back in twenty five thirty years we've got to demonize these things and and really make people think that their machine guns and this was the strategy back then and when when Dianne Feinstein opened request shooting\nOf a judge Kavanaugh\nIs the first thing she turned to was guns and and the ... he's a\nDissenting opinion which really was in two thousand eleven and what he said about semi automatic rifles and and then she said something that just is bizarre I called her on this in print she said what about the hundreds of school shootings that we've had over the years involving assault rifles\nThat was just hogwash and I don't know where she gets the stuff but the too many in the
