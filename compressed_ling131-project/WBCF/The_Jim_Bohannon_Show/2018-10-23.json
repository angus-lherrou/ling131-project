seeing rallies it is it's gargantuan is anything we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and a pact or basketball arena tonight with Trump and cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox infringed today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people about the caravan\nAnd here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you monitoring crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stops this caravan and all of his threats listen to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nMichael let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that that the United states has even immigration laws\nI I think an even immigration laws are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized an updated ah ah but this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants sure\nSo what should the United states do if those seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand which of the United states feel about this for this is the\n... country on the planet I think we can handle a I'm a a a caravan of people unarmed come into this country so let them as well I I'm saying to process improperly John real quick on the ... there's a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening it gets turning the talking points or\nTreating I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly infant is treated such as that way so I I think the ... these these are human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solutions I'm offered um in in\nDealing with a short but at the backdrop is the midterms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens for a discussion\nAlright that's from Fox and friends is one of my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim let's not all political stop the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken throw in there headed toward the border and it may happen next week challenge of next week right before the midterms\nWell this is the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass but this shortage invasive behaviors gone on every day I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is a type of thing that goes on and I think\nThis plays badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let them in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd the military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong we do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process\nThis it is not just political\nAnd all of this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I got a lot more sounds on this coming up but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to us the ban and that was really good stuff you're the man of mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty Jim boat that will do it eight six six fifty jumbo get you to me ... this caravan story if it breaks right if they reach the border say days before the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media are thinking America's totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't feel good as Americans of Trump's stops\nIt I think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it\nHe loses faith in the base of people saying that's why we elected you to stop stuff like this we don't want this love to hear from you my name is Don junior data I'm sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood One [noise]\n\n\nOne of the sea of radio\n[noise] the FBI is investigating after an explosive device was fun Monday at the New

Republican\nAnd we've done our own what we supposed to how this is insane to let these people come in each country and they're going to run over our border and and getting to the bottom of it\nAnd we have to do all means necessary if Donald Trump got the calls the army out on the air force of the Marines to stop them being all means necessary it must be done\nI hear you I hear you there logical that Steve I mean mark but I don't think that's exactly what the Democrats in the media are hoping for you know what that would be like\nIn the short term as people are emotional if it happened right before the election in the long term you're absolutely right we cannot have people think they're just going to storm the border\nWe you know I'm behind Donald Trump one hundred percent he's doing a great job he's a great guy and if it gets to it\nI mean it's always in the war if it has to we got to make sure we when and if that's what it's going to take the stop them at that border let's go

near the border hey bill welcome in\nHey how's it going tonight I'm\nVery very good you know I I went to the border in Arizona Sheriff Joe and the like and we often forget about that and you guys have it as bad if not as worse is Texas and the places we normally think about\nYeah um\nSays in the places we normally think about\nYeah um it's manageable or at least the government was smart enough to uh inundate the border with agents are where we had controlled and a better but now with these horns coming as it's getting back out of control\nWhat used to have a\nGood yeah well the here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know a\n... he could the president could send the military down there which is a smart move however listen these people are coming\nAnd it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was to set up a massive refugee camp a we have the greatest military on a set it up no time set up with Ken and with mess halls in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need and therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you can either do it by the human error stationery over in Sierra Vista at the ... and here's the thing is and we used to do this a long time ago what what you do is it\nSo these people are overly claim some refugee status or some asylum status and stuff and\nAnd what they do is they they um\nSet them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they what they should do is set up these um um um this is where I could you can\nAnd then have them go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good ... and send down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they can all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain\nAnd then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway we've out releasing them into the United states and if they go through this then we could do what's called the jeep pet flight which is a repatriation flights to their country\nAnd hold on I'm In agreement with that he had a problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because there's well by the numbers whoever's organizing this and it's going to be bigger\nI don't know how you're going to hurt them toward these refugee camps to be heard I don't think they're going to settle for that\nWell I'll be honest with you I you know what ... who's in charge they are are we are\nWell look so your ideas humanitarian aid\nControl here and I tell you right slump we're talking to those three countries in saying that we're going to look cut off your ah money that's right well that's good but they're forgetting one big country and this and that would be Mexico the rights to cut them off to if they can't control it and they've got a military that they can control and we can control\nBut well put thank you look that Senate humanitarian idea that the fly in the white man is I don't think it's acceptable and who's in charge well so far it legal immigration has been in charge the ball is in President Trump's

from a great guy you know there's plenty of room for him and the Republican Party or independent if Democrats don't want them imagined being kicked out around that\nBut we're seeing tonight a couple of things I wanted to ask you were seeing in Texas and I'm hoping that we can you hear from somebody maybe in the Houston area they're traveling back that listed on the radio that behind and show eight six six fifty jumbo\nThat was that the Trump rally cruise rally the tailgate that the guesstimate is it could be eighty two hundred thousand people at some point today were on those grounds are around them this truly was epic just amazing even for taxes eight six six fifty\nJumbo and if you've been to a Trump rally\nWhat is the magic of it when you're inside the entertainment of that the I mean these people in Montana last week we're\nWaiting hours out there in freezing temperatures not just you know I I don't know who I Would wait for for that number of hours or ever have waited for four or five hours or more eight six six fifty jumbo get you on board now\nI didn't have a chance I wasn't on the gym I did it on my own shown Philadelphia though the opposition to this is just enraged tonight on several levels Kevin McCarthy he's the house majority leader said this guy prematurely grey nice looking guy California\nWell his office was vandalized a Boulder is the report ... a large Boulder these guys picked up a Boulder not just a brick and drove through the window and took off they have it up on his Instagram account\nThrowing a Boulder holding a Boulder up between the two of them and throwing it through a window of Boulder attack\nAnd here's the thing who are the most divisive celebrities in America a focus group last week did this morning console his call and they took celebrities entertainers people like may talk show host satellite and the criteria was\nThat there is the most polarity between Democrats and Republicans with these two in other words Democrats favor the Republicans were opposed or\nThe opposite got it so Hannity was in second place Russia was in third what do you think was number one\nAnd I'm going to tell you who number four was and I think she's been out it Ellen DeGeneres was number for not may shock you think of Alan\nNice enough women that seems to me the dancing at all that well here's an example though you know she brings on Democrat politicians right before the midterms right before the presidential race just gives them an incredible forum everybody so nice there's no challenge and it's like an infomercial for them that's what it's about\nWell the executive producer do you know what the executive producer is that's the top producer out a multitude of producers of the Ellen DeGeneres show tonight showed his hand and I think this is what the degenerate show was about\nHe attacked millennia Trump I mean look you can attack president how do you attack in Milan and you drop the executive\nTrump I mean look you can attack president how do you ... the executive producer Andy lashing her took to Twitter to insult Mrs Trump and to praise the care of and he said\nI'm way more afraid of another ... getting into this country than I Am of any of the caravan of human beings seeking asylum is what he wrote and I maintain this is exactly the mentality of the people\nAround these shows even as something that seems to be as offensive as the Alan ... number for the most divisive about Republicans and Democrats see who's the number one most divisive figure out there and it needs to Russia's three you get that polarity you know they're provocative chores\nBut this guy the executive producer of the Ellen DeGeneres show tipping their hand here Monica is a bigger threat than this human caravan coming our way can you imagine eight six six fifty jumbo eight six six five zero five forty six twenty six let's get some callers in right now Don\nIn Albany, Oregon is nectar good evening good evening Hi\nDuring good myself I'm just I just have one question for your are communist socialist their own worst enemies more often than not\nA in some ways but here's the problem down right now we have whole generations of people that have been under educated or indoctrinated in colleges and the like and to them socialism is not human misery socialism seems like a new id and kind of cool to them as strange as it is\nYeah but I think something like that myself\nNo but that's a big difference of course we couldn't we've seen this we've lived through various things uh these millennials and the like today I'm done and they just see that they're going to get something out of what is a tough time for them thank you and it is for some millennials\nStudent loan debt Everytime I see this Cory Booker is out there tonight you know the Spartacus guy the guy in South Jersey Cory Booker is calling for fifty thousand dollars be given\nTo children in various families of under income that's his big ploy running for president\nJust give them fifty thousand dollars that's the way to ah make things more equitable fifty grand a hundred grand I don't know the fifties enough\nAnd I I've seen Democrat after Democrat\nGoing after student loan debt well here's the thing who's charging all this the people that run colleges are progressive Democrats making a lot of money why are they charging it well every time they raise the rates people start scream how much it costs to go to college so what do they do\nThey have to get more student loans and more money from the government and so then what do they do they raise the cost who's responsible\nFor how costly it is to go to college it's the people running colleges making that decision these figures are not figures that are reasonable or keeping up with inflation or anything else they're made up figures they're charging but everything got away with and it's outrageous\nAnd I think you're starting to see a little bit of a pullback here\nBut it's progressive set a running All right so who is the most polarizing figure celebrity figure out there yeah wouldn't show and if you've ever been to a Trump rally and I'm really hoping to get somebody I think we might have a couple of coming up\nHere on the ...

you support that Trump's agenda or conservative causes there is not just going to be a blue wave here it's not going to happen in the Senate Republicans are going to pick up three or four Senate seats\nOn top of what they already have a house that's where the battle is that's going to be tough it's going to be very very close not a blue wave but\nAs a caravan bears down on us as we see people throwing boulders windows harassing Mitch McConnell as he ate at what looked to be like an Applebee's and all that\nPeople are getting more enthused and get out there and vote will take your calls a

that area you\nGot to give us a little bit of your play by play on at the big Trump rally Katie Brennan\nIs a woman who were deeply for governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who is very very liberal running for president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named Alvarez about a hundred and forty thousand dollar jobs housing czar in the Murphy administration after he won drove her home\nOr you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked you use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done tells her best friend who joined her she's shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to the Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy Murphy sour they'll get back to meet with her at least the governor did and then they never do\nHere's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't this be the perfect follow up story if they were really serious about talking about these issues the only national media that's done anything with this is the wall Street Journal they gave her a forum they did investigation they wrote this up\nAnd now\nLegislature apparently is going to have a special\nAnd now the legislature apparently is going to have a special team investigate this and\nA a former a judge is being brought in to investigate but why should a national media not interested in is even the local media only talk radio twelve ten and somewhat and Jay dot com occasionally they write about it\nYou would think this would be all the rage given what we went through with cabinet here's a woman with resources that's it by the book now Dr Ford you can argue arches only Fifteen back in the day she doesn't can't remember and all this and we're told if\nThe woman says all that though it's true you have to believer Cory Booker in Jersey and these others right well\nThis woman said the same thing and what does this guy gets criminal penalties or not he was applying for a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job and despite all these complaints they still gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's where the wall Street Journal seems to say\nThe point being the double standard rears its head her name is Katie Brent it\nIn any way that you can spread that around tell people you see the wall Street Journal piece\nAbout it it's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard of what actually goes on so if the standard coming out of cabin up people on the left in the media you shouldn't be on the court\nIf a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview this is hanging over his head\nHow does this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met with her how is it the national media doesn't want you to know out there in gyms audience\nAbout this nobody no follow up\nNow even if they want to say they follow the story and the woman they think is crying wolf here well that's\nAn object lesson I could live with that if that's where they come up with a coming through the me too era and all that or could it be\nThat when Governor Christie was governor we have bridge gate and there was tremendous national media and I think it was a serious thing what
