path of devastation across the Florida Panhandle it dropped from a category four to eighty one storm now is it begs which way across south western Georgia was damaging winds and rain forecast you say the storm continues to cause flooding along the Florida Gulf Coast\nBrian Todd has more on what it was considered the strongest storm to hit the continental us so it's Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to\nBe heavy rain and sustained winds pulling homes apart flooding river ripping railings from the ground\n[noise] collapsing beside home [noise]\nWeaving away construction\nHalf the category for storm picked up intensity in the Gulf is it barrels inland making landfall with winds of up to one hundred fifty five miles per hour\nThe I made landfall around twelve thirty the storms biggest threat to the devastating flooding if France was expected service as high as Thirteen or fourteen feet\nWeeks of Appalachia cola already dangerously underwater\nWeeks of Appalachian coal off already dangerously underwater the northwest coastal town with a six foot surge even before Michael made landfall responders unable to reach those in need as waves crash down along and on top of major highways\nThere is going to be a killer killer storm surge in Savannah nine ten eleven feet no one's going to survive that low lying areas the Gulf of Mexico are kind of like a base in the water are being pushed up on people and uh if you're still there when that comes and you're going to die\nFlorida officials hammering home the message the storm surge alone can kill you but it is now to link to evacuate\nThe worst thing you can do now is leaf and put yourself in your family in danger\n[laughter]\n[noise] and uh with bad as a prologue let's talk a bit more about the storm but of course the tonight we also know the White House says that the president has spoken with the Governor Scott\nWho told the president not to visit the state until next week and a a a lot to interfere therefore with rescue effort is always a problem of course whenever high profile ... individuals are given area like that and and frequently they can can cause a distraction [noise]\nLooks to talk more about this with Dr Brian ... Neves assistant professor at the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York Dr try and good evening good\nEvening good to have you with us on the program that I I every storm is a is unique in one way or another your take on what we've seen of Michael\nAnd I was noticing a doctor time or comments made by the Taj a regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering out why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf and a stream and that is a you know the the leaf is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a certain ... ah not moving very quickly what like forest and they were sort of linger over a place in a given period of time whereas\nA leaf in a fast moving stream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nUm uh it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um\nA window overall uh area for a longer period of time and that has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall hum button in terms of the when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow and fast\nI see so other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed Iran not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins no no it isn't\nVery good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants they're up continue to move across the Georgia having a course of the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd uh is still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Brian ... tang this\nDepartment in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people do they I think uh they live at all these terms like a old lace we'll satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of us and really know what that is but it it sounds like you folks were are totally on touch\nWith the with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time I we used to make jokes about the weatherman and how little they knew and compared with today I guess you know how do you watch today we act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that and did it strikes me that there's a happy ballads there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight it's it's the nature of the beast that weather prediction will always be uncertain too to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come a very very long way and the ability to predict whether interpreted uh extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany a that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system but start with formation\n... what is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and land tick 'em we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form in the middle of Africa and they will move off the coast of Africa\nAnd uh in the middle of Africa and they will move off the coast of Africa and about um\nTen percent of them so really tiny fraction of them will form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nWhy that time of year I Know there is a season but they're going to be a wide\n... that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nI'm deaf also when the uh the atmosphere is is uh uh the the the more most moist um and that is also went and kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck of the woods over the winter that's when it's the furthest north\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to far\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with the of the world at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of of what this thing could do and I asked him and so is there anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers at camp crunchy said yeah we can get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure and low pressure areas\nIs that you can put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it couldn't handle that can handle the other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\nUh yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements over the entire globe and that all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast them out on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get ... a a more powerful and um we we sort of learn about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked at ... at the tropical psych load formation of this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the [laughter] [laughter] but now that the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression\nWhy do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight and and Tennessee changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical aside from prediction that something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong a tropical site found or hurricane\nUm so what sort of ... we we generally understand kind of what feel with ... that is as you as you said before it kind of the warmer ocean waters that a light below the ... or ... below the hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for this to power the winds of the storm\nAll right and then that takes us do interactions with the the the climate system itself or are\nThere uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression to do a storm to to hurricanes ah portions of the planet where a a all else being equal or it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\n... the the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that formed the um Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific\nI'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons but you know the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that there's another thing that I think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess what what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and it's in the western Pacific and fights loans yeah just sort of generic sites on the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting and those are just terms of convenience we're centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes ... which is why I and the science community we just referred to everything as a tropical cyclone instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nWhere are All right we'll continue our discussion tonight and your calls welcome of course uh either as a a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather ah and\nAlso in the experiences you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six\nFive oh five four six to six our guest is Dr Bryan tagging assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York back with more in just a moment\n\n[noise] news talk more than one in ... bc of radio\n[noise]\nMichael weekends on John Callahan Fox News one of the strongest hurricane ever to strike the United states has now been drawn a downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves into central Georgia's\nJust to the south and make and continuing to pull off very quickly off towards the north East that quick emotion is at least one of the good pieces of news and it's not going to rain that much in any one spot Fox\nMeteorologist wreck wreck mute the store and moved to shore midday Wednesday just east of Panama City Florida where we find Fox's ...\nWeather has improved dramatically here but the damage assessments just getting started Ninety One percent of bay counting here is in the dark and that's one of the reasons why there is a mandatory curfew an effect because there are so many power lines down and trees down\nI mean that even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf or there were\nTankers here were African traders bar just on a highway Ninety and up into the residents that area\nAnd get they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know Facebook or shellfish or anything I just wondering if you can comment on it and that's given no reference as far as the ... of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nYou're right you're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot a lot of people these days don't you know remember a restaurant because I did occur such a long time ago and you're right the the\nPictures of of the the devastation along the coast or\nOr was absolutely tremendous um [noise] what's what's different today perhaps is that oh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nJust I'm because of delivering on a ... a very desirable thing people love to you know let's look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that yeah\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that conversation I went through the entire thing uh-huh I went to all of it so I mean I'm\nWell I got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that came to little not too ... ...\n... ... you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area I'm a tendency to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assumed they can for instance they can take their windows and\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but I'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season began do you have a plan you\nPrepare and emergency kit and and it's it's a ... like this where where um you know it comes to ...\nI Lived through the the tail end of your meal and uh it almost eight my car or is it the war

eastern portion of North Carolina our guest Dr Bryan tag is an assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York\nAnd we're looking after the storm in the in particular is something that you just said that in speaking with our previous caller a doctor tag and that is about our our uh\nPropensity for building in areas that the frankly just are safe and I've often wondered about that I mean when when you see a condo that it's virtually right on the edge of the of the ocean\nI mean you are just pure begging for a for major problems there and I've I've often wondered why why's zoning allows that yes I Know you're right that that we have this desire I Am on the ocean front well\nI'm Sorry that that's not good enough to me that that that that just foolish to this\nDay you touch on to the you know an important point and and something that I think needs to be discussed for and that\nUm you know where the terms of um [noise] how people managed or the risk and there there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes have your narrow fault line [noise]\nUm [noise] but in terms of um who's responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance\nUm the federal government a has a national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast um and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have homeowner's insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so you need to buy policies through a federal program or\nA private company that offers sort of flood insurance and I'm a sort of who pays for that that catastrophe poll uh when when that that risk is realized um is kind of a is a subject of great debate um and controversy\nMhm absolutely uh it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be a changes in in how insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could\nIt's yeah it's it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think I'm a you know it's it's really kind of up to how how to state and wants to sort of crafting legislation on terms of\nUm there there are caps on insurance premiums and other sort of policies that they can put out there um take them at local local municipalities and and areas can put up zoning restrictions\nUm to prevent people from voting a risky areas and ah you know one one of the things that perhaps to incentivize\nPeople from voting and really really high risk areas is that if they do it in that area they have to take on to forest themselves so they're not insured basically if you know they they lose their property um they they um owned or the costs of it\nNinety seven one F.

six all kinds of money things out there it's a major part of a of our lives even if uh\nMaybe investing or or playing or various a market games or or not or shall we say your hobby but the fact is that we all our economic beings to one extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nThis is talk to or not only I guess Jordan Goodman America's money yes was mad but to see the new calls in from ... lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening Jim uh or remember one night in\nA very for those who don't know that Steven was in the same unit I was in in in Vietnam but to go ahead\nYeah but you are also for and\nI Do I I was I was actually listed also but anyway what do you have it for what do you have for our for our guest\nAsked him about gold but it's so it's been for me I'm a Seventy year old and uh I\nUh it's always been colder value for me uh it's it's really a stayed the same or get terrier aided in the last year and I was wanting to do it\nOr it it in the last year and I was wanting to know if a ... if he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but it's been going down because when interest rates go up go goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announce\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower than that\nSo I I don't say it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and gold is not growing up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new kind of safety valve and even that haven't been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a platinum as kind of a of a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker wait wait so none of the national smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your service as well\n[noise] about ah\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah you know go just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the federal service raised rates are loud and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that is all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nBut do you see an interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though it was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point too\nI think it's going higher ... let me just to have a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not in that fire for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month or so called quantitative easing program that's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing quantitative tightening so went bonds come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the deficit that we have are being financed with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in debt just at quarter alone today there are options of the thirty year bond that ten year bond they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nBuilds and builds go up and prices go down\nThere you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to some more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break go take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving\nThe student loan indebtedness one eight six six five oh

ashore it used to Panama City Florida midday Wednesday as a strong category for hurricane\nAnd made landfall two miles an hour short and they kept five hurricane and this will go down in the record books for many reasons one of which\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available\nThere's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the way this number was six point nine million jobs unfilled\nEmployers cannot find the people to do tool and dye making or swimming or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college don't either have the skills were the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your butt in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you're ever while student loans were under economic pressure to do something and a lot of people take jobs that are right but I've got a service those didn't know that over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's it's pretty pathetic\nI thought if you wind up doing doing a job you're not particularly fond of a because it pays the bills this was I think called growing up we will be back with
