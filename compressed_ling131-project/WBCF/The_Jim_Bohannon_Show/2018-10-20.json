six on live five is a jumbo had a show dot com you can follow me on Twitter\nAt Jim Botox well Tuesday will be two weeks until the election we're getting very close to one of the more important midterm elections in recent memory and that we have a sort of take a look at it from a variety of angles and we thought we might take a look at it this evening\nFrom the standpoint of the largest uh rather fastest growing a voting bloc in the country one of the largest of such voting blocks the Latino vote and do so and the company of a ... he is the founder and CEO of ... wealth management a good evening good to have you with us\nThanks for having me Jim honor to be here\nThank you very much a first of all it is a a large group or or just in terms of of sheer numbers are there are about twenty nine million Latinos eligible to vote nationwide they make up a twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and those are I Believe a new hives right\nYou're absolutely ... a lot of them are not ...\nWell that was another interesting and always a disappointing when you look at it\nAre not ... well that was another\nInteresting er and always a disappointing when you look at any segment of the population a and that is that the midterm vote ... rates for Latinos Asians and wide reach ... record lows in ... fourteen\nThe Latino voter turnout rate in the mid term elections has declined steadily since twenty oh six\nAnd a that dropped in twenty fourteen to a record low twenty seven percent\nA white and Asian eligible voters also had record low turnout rates are although there was a record number of Latinos voting six point eight million in the twenty four teams will be because their numbers were growing but still as a percentage\nThat is a decidedly disappointing given some a serious in contentious issues at stake why do you suppose that is\nWell you know it's funny Jim I quite the Latino vote\nKind of like a three headed monster\nThere so many moving parts here so many different head hurt the immigrants you have the first and second generation and the well established generations here in the United states where the immigrants might think Warren way you know can we get behind that you know I and I can only speculate can we get\nBehind the candidate that\nListens to us that may speak our language so although not a necessary component and\nIs it worth our time to go to the polls now I hate saying that gym but it's absolutely true I can remember back in the days when I worked in the warehouse and they would pay us to go and could vote that a lot of the guys would take that time\nAs Pamela Brown reports will likely see more of a newly minted rallying cry at those rallies\nDemocrats but just mobs Republicans reduce jobs\nI knew rhyming line of attack from President Trump as he tries to pump up Republican voters by laying out a closing argument around two weeks from the mid term election\n[noise] I Know a lot of cabinet all law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nAnd remember it's gonna be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nFrom feeding on a new might bring caravan thousands of Central Americans nearing Mexico's southern border presumably headed to the U.S\nI Will say I have caused the problem was such an incredible autonomy I have so many\nThat everybody\n\nWas the worst flaws in the world when you're on a hell of a job using those laws to blame Democrats without evidence supporting the immigration and fly\nAs you know I'm willing to send a military to defend our southern border [noise]\nAll illegal immigration onslaught by the Democrats because there's no way knowledge or change the laws they like it\nTrump also taking a Twitter with his Democratic conspiracy theory I Am watching the Democrat Party lettuce south on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador the leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S\nAgain same without evidence this group of migrants are criminals Democrats for their part accusing the president of the year mongering\nThey almost want there to be an immigration a challenge there most cheering it on a because they're looking for some way to create a something to frighten the American people during an election\nWith control of the house and Senate and the balance trumpet in full campaign mode as the election season enters its final week\nCampbell Brown and with all due respect to Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals you said that they include criminals just a little parsing of the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking to I with the key lay low ratio of the rail wealth management\nAnd looking at or something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you do this is right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states nation states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets into their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who uh get a warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and singing kumbaya I Am not one of those people\nAre I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without that country's permission or do you uh take exception to do any of that\n[noise] you know I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that we should have a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not\nSure to have a better policy on immigration\nI'm not that it's not strong enough that it shouldn't be definitely more clearer and um that we should be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries out there was a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries have were created by us I mean unless Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries\nSo you know ... it's kind of a double edged\nThing although everyone mildly US government policy that created in most Thirteen\n[laughter] of course not of course not All right from LA\nUh they they they certainly are and of course many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who wind up in other countries who who wind up ah a entering this country uh but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by demonstrator out in California some months back and it it it's stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration has a right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a right you may argue that you would think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is a notch\nAnd or should not be quote a rights but a privilege to be conferred by a nation state uh depending on what is the best interests of the nation state but to call it a right or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and in my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not\nYour thoughts [noise] you know uh [noise] I think things are changing you know just a by twenty fifty\nHispanics or or you know actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like to turn back to you know it's more selective apart house\nOr a by twenty fifth you are we are a warning for one in four ...\nPersons here in the United states aren't going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that or not if we don't terror policies that address this coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more uh sons and daughters\nUh than an average angle a family um but more importantly we used\nTo terror policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr and an advocacy we are are dealing in pigeons will get a few from our audience as well here and they just a few minutes\nAh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or in my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who were let's say a robbing a bank or that we would probably wind up separating those parents from their children\nAnd my response or frankly to those people is a\nRap somewhat say harsh but uh this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures are entering this country and yes sometimes they are a\nVery lengthy and sometimes they are Laden with red tape but a Soviet of that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house\nYour thoughts [noise] you know a\nMany your ... uh an back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration John and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point\nBut you know for looking at it from the other side of the class you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had it I did a whole show on that and and uh ... ... is not exaggerating that that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long we proceed\nYou know so you know in that sense if we could you know if we can get both sides of the aisles start having the dialogue started having this conversation no one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy\nBut we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\n... and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino bothers me not one wet and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this was not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and so any way or the point of course obviously then we'll discuss this in the the next half hour of the program with our guest is is we're talking about the Latino vote and the midterm elections to what extent\nIs this an issue of for the Latino population are obviously it is at issue is an issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a crime of all the other issues that affect everyone how does this fit into the ... will be back in just a moment\n\nUsed talk sports Ninety seven one F.
