Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey in the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nYeah I uh I was just\nThinking that they're saying to my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least the portions of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence indicating that the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nI mean let me expand upon that point I'm not saying that there was\nLet me let me expand upon that point I'm\nNot saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain\nAnd disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to walk a tightrope you should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence in his in our nation's help in their ah dilemmas that we're helping them with so that's my opinion\nWell All right very good any ah any thoughts or the ... to the caller\nHad been trying to think about different things that might can be done [noise] also and one might be to significantly limit the number of a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here or not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make some sort of statement about this\nUm yes I mean I see your point there is Jim and our talking at the beginning of the shows this is an extremely complicated issues there are good and bad and nobody to us how horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it used to be in some ways\nYes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula of Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate both of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think you should give a fair pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts\nI'm not giving the mass either I'm just not sure why there's a lot we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it the brutality of their act\nOr the parrot brutality again what we have so far or stories don't pass it on no no no no just supposed to be clear about this flu we at this juncture does not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that and\nThen when you look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one gets headed during interrogation\nHere why aggressive as soon as I heard that I thought okay that what that means is they tortured\nHim of doing that I thoroughly agree on it have you\nI mean has it as if this was never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not saying what do you do about it do you cut off our nose despite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nBut not wait just a minute here we do not know that the Saudi Government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nHave won't on heal the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when you have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically scaring the world to act you have to do something and and\nEven even at even to the exclusion of our own best interests let's say that al ... to ... salary in ... just finished by state with before we get your answer a let's say al ... took control of the Saudi peninsula how does that improve things either for the people there or for this country\nDo you think it's good to have a government that will take someone ... poetry\nObviously not and I I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going to pose the question that without interruption and then let you respond to it let's assume that\nThe al ... or ISIS forces took control of the Saudi peninsula every bit as brutal is this ... regime maybe more so and very ethical and if that I go to the interests of the United states how is that an improvement Luke\nHow is butchering someone ...\nObviously you just don't have to deal with reality okay I understand your outrage but like so many people in this country today your outrage does not have any logical conclusion the ads for of course to what I posed was it wouldn't\nBe better and until you come up with some kind of have a better answer other than just were outraged and we're going to do something that will be\nA harmful to the United states and the Saudi people because it'll make us feel better I don't consider that a responsible answer a to get any thoughts from used that needs to go to the next call here\nYeah we do have to be very practical about it and we have to put the interests of American citizens first both whether they be in the region or in this country right now in our on our strategic military interests around the globe and everything else\nIt'd be a little different if this would be the only time in history that any regime as ever acted in a brutal way well guess what it isn't and I'm so sorry that the human condition is as bad as it is but it is and the notion if there's it never happened before and all of human history I Would say\nHow outrageous

Barnes why are we sending money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a useful unless that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is that is a little hard to understand\nI don't understand it all I don't I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them one time\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different but they are someone who can be

consulate\nWouldn't just revoke his path for a which certainly was for it and they were told you do show a claim that he's violated multiple Saudi law\nHim back to Saudi Arabia it goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and is your story on a stick in the New York times\nAgain he would be just as out of the way the and uh I I think that uh again we have a a very rational thought process from Rick uh get it and less and less we really think Sydney Powell the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of big screen brutality or could they sent their message out I mean I Would think the ... just described would end up itself be a shall we say I'm a pleasant enough faith to send a message to dissidents\n[noise] well it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman and evil sort of regime\nAnd they are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me that they have generally been\nPretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance or\nMaybe that's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything by killing\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well I think that that was somehow pass oh okay you're already tried to maybe a little bit ah maybe that maybe the I I\nOh okay you're only tried to maintain a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are that's stupid Linda in champagne Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that only armed\nAnd certainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe a came from a family of arms dealers have within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is the talk of this or that that hardly makes them a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to chat right in favor of Israel that that shouldn't have been allowed and everything ... says that um and\nI don't honestly think that the Saudi Government would've than ... ... like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really what happened you\nKnow we do but but I was thinking about this rogue elements in a consulate consulates these are not just places like boutiques the shopping center where you just wander in\nNow but people can decide to do something that's not smart and I think that the fellow called in about ranting maybe on something and it may have been done partly make Trump look bad and try and make a ... you know because\nOf that that that is a level of Machiavellian thought you will have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on the everybody on the left in the United states I mean I don't see any game here for the risk\nOf all that I'm saying that right before the election is is that you know causing the administration is a huge headache\nWell it's got to be in the ... the minor league headache I mean let's face it I think this is not this is not the Iranian nuclear deal is just not a a jobs and

Westwood One radio where with one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six online find as a jumbo head on shows dot\nCom you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox in this part of the program we're going to be talking to a certain extent about the extent to which word everybody's faces all the time\nWhy is it necessary for the national dialogue to be conducted at that volume\nIs it necessary certainly isn't\nConstructive it certainly is a logical\nAnd yet there must be some reasons why it is happening well we're joined by position and psycho analyst Dr Richard ... who was trained in both ... and the European analyses to look at this through his book out of control\nApocalyptic psychology in the age of Trump and uh we uh we thank you for being with is said to my doctor grade\nWell thank you for having me\nDo you have a ... just as an overall explanation before we get them to some of the details behind it why we seem to be out of control at this time\nUh I think it's probably many reasons but the point of the book\nWas really to try to frame the whole political issue in terms of the underlying psychology and I I think the psychological physicians are probably best trade with respect to the concept\nOf religious conflict because I think there are many aspects of what's taking place now that really ... uh what goes on between a sectarian groups are out of religious level\n... okay I Am a a a a a religious\nLevel All right a blue blazer amplify further on that uh obviously we're not talking about uh two different religious sects per se unless you want to uh uh consider a I suppose the or tradition\nUnless you want to uh uh consider a I suppose the more traditional a Judeo Christian ethic\nOn the one hand as a religious sect and there's a new uh identity politics a political correctness and the like ah as being a mother a religious sect or this is a is grounded in which I'm not a perhaps a totally understanding what you're saying\nOkay well despite the fact that most of the matter is similar probably very few individuals who don't ascribe to some degree of secular already a there are religious underpinnings to a secular thought\nAnd they do fall in line with the Judeo Christian ethic except it's in large measure a breakdown of the ... and Christian aspect of that effort\nYeah my phone is I got to live on well okay for\nTaking my call sure I I don't consider myself a real intelligent person but you know when I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot uh-huh if they were talking about George Washington when he became president he did not want a party at them and I just think that might help\nWhat a shame they didn't take it out because\nYou know if it if it got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter or named up what they said about\nThat and that way I see it we don't need any ... with other white\nUp on that cap in our case you know if a new whatever something happened to the port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that\nBut up to me it's not the issue right here in the fact that Obama he killed somebody for the for all we got to wait until after the election\nBut now the issue with on the other what they get it before the election\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one vote before it deferring to a doctor Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions\nFactions are almost proof that we have a free government\nIf you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion and like minded people will get together and organize\nTo try and convince others of their point of view it is an essential part of society now can faction lives will be carried too far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that but the notion\nThat you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility and by the bird to Dr Creighton\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation ultimately for or\nYou can unify groups to ultimately break down into smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of avoiding sanctions or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is the extremes\nOf polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to this is ...\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the riding a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... always enjoy your show and thank you thank you Lynn it gets to a point when you go to a\nOr were you allowed and on I ... I don't know if the person or the establishment is less like whatever the or I don't understand this rude once those ...\n... when he gets to a point where you can't go out and have reason debate without someone screaming at you spending alone you know and then you can't\nI really don't care of your disposition\nJust let's let's have a reason to bake I mean if we can talk with a screaming at each other ... which ... which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I called the Clinton machine this machine has his just use to give up the fact that two years ago two years ago ...\nYou know you lost the election okay I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest and then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nAgain I'm not sure the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the boats Clinton's ah especially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen the ... across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic and that is that much of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and ... that is to say anti fascist and the tragic irony is uh\nThey called themselves antifa that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course that those tactics\nOf silence thing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people but that is that is is the sad a problem and that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective\nThat you are so pure and you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else\nThan the only adds you are in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest prosecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you're several important points uh one of the points I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's been said for some time now that is an increasing degree\nOf of the offices within the society and then the judge to increasing degree of moral perfectionism obsession all thinking is in society\nAs a result when when when one encounters those types of psychological structuring individual uh those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the the denied a self\nMake up and to place them on people around them\nAre so when you have a group like a ...\nA claiming that the anti fascist and you look at the after it's very very obvious that the behaviors that if you're one would expect\nFrom the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the ride for everything that they're doing\nA and and denying claiming that it's right to just doing it so that's I think the motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are\nCurrently on the books a for a place like Portland for for the mayor of Portland to sit by and have people rioting on the streets and refusing to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions\nAnd boundaries that are a free society must have and it's that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah ah again it it it is not something that uh that that can can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a police shooting that brought the rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass or behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome\nNobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity\nNobody who's teaching yeah go ahead\nWell again absolutely but it it's the role of the Gulf than a both at the local level in the federal level ... of the country and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outburst from these groups because they're essentially unable to behave badly\nExactly oh we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people respond positively when are they are told that their tactic\nIs uh is going to be tolerated stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology involved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the dollar just power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in
