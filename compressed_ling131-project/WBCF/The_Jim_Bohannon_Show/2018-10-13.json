in this uh this country\nA I had never heard of these programs I guess it's a sign that maybe it's a sign of my own a lack of diligence and in finding out what's going on although we know now or or is it just a sign of how stratified we are that there are very few\nExperiences in common that the transcended generations in this country that something like this could be happening I I've long but it's taken for granted for example David that advice stand in the supermarket checkout line that the uh\nThe names that are splashed across the tabloids first names only that I don't know who any of them are anymore but I Would have hoped I ever would have heard something about this before now\nWell it is part of it is that we're we're\nBut I ever would have heard something about this before no well it is part of it\nIs that we're we're going through channels that are not part of the traditional media and so it's really a ... I I wouldn't call it a subversive but it's it's certainly a outflank came the traditional media\nAre it is it is true however the for the first season we had something around a hundred and ... million\nViews in the media and John just awful for example devoted one of his programs to love God and\nThere are many columnist wrote about it many other places uh and of course yourself taking the time um it's something that is in the ... it's in the sentence and I think that's the good news is if if it was something that wasn't getting traction and I think we'd have to reconsider\nFame into

don't really have a question I just wanted to say that I think you're you're going a little bit under any age category here with uh the home with a millennial thing because I'm thirty five but I guess that puts me at like the higher end of what a millennial is even though I I Would identify more generation X\nBecause I grew up around people that you know where\nThe older generation that are now about forty and I identify more as generation X then and generation y which became a so called millennial anybody that's an undergrad in college right now is younger than a millennial according to the map that said they'd be like Generation Z\nRight he's a new one that younger than that that are in the ... about twenty three by my youngest brother would be at the ... the youngest of millennials and he's already graduated college and have the job so you're you're\nYou're absolutely right and ... you are a millennial you're actually in the the upper half tier of millennials which I think goes to the age of ... of a thirty eight now\nUm and of course these categories are imprecise you know there there are many different kinds of millennials but overall there is a certain pattern to them and that pattern is not unique to millennials it is true with younger\nPeople as well so that when we developed this this program the original season long list targeting primarily college age and through young adult I'm here to cruise the second season is primarily focusing on early career is as the millennial um\nGroup sort of pass was through the demography ah so I think that it's a it's a very much as the way you're describing on one thing I should also point out this goes back to the gym was mentioning\nAbout the uh cynicism about millennials and it's also true with younger people as well that ah even despite that um it turns out from very surveys that\nAre about this is about forty two percent of young Americans including millennials support capitalism about thirty thirty three percent say they support socialism although most of them don't let socialism is\nUh the surveys show that um trust in the federal government is around twenty three percent\nAny acute news talk Ninety seven caring
