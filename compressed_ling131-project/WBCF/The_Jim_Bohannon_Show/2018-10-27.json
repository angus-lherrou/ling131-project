Florida according to the criminal complaint is involved here as recently as Wednesday say I posted a tweet that was critical of the billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros\nGood evening again you know ... for this\nBut I agree with you hear a fake out I mean this trial you know he had these rallies take a lotta here take 'em out of here\nI don't know it all like throughout the rest is history to hear a ... or to angle when we've had a early elections\nThere's been no civility here and there was no way before we start that this is going on\nIn even hear the news broke that this is going on for lack of facilities pills or did he thought that navy all the news isn't it a a a thought it was to take it\nThat they come down here ... off a little bit it'd be interesting if anybody else out throughout the early ... ... s early voting state this diet it but he now they hear\nIt on but when you say when you say pretty nasty there are sort of you are you're talking about an actual polling places that right\nAfter the years you know you've got one side on one side and the other side on another side and you know one side trading at the other and talking\nAbout people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning within so many feet of a bowling side\nYeah it's like a hundred feet but what was happening and it wasn't it was it's not only for eating at the other people that they were like yeah\nBut it was it with a different party at the army's were actually at one that's out there in in some cases already for at one another so even when they heard that that's going on\nHere is hey there and it'd be interesting is what happened and why is that the Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again uh I uh uh\nYou you in other words you have in in uh in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't see a lot of places that you actually have have a normal polling places like\nFire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox you send in an absentee ballot or or or do a protest in the offices of let's say a a cow the uh\nUh the county office building so these are actual polling places I well\nYeah well well what they call it is early election or anything like this both his early ... but then after a certain state they have to go to their kids ages ... to salt and then of course you can see the apple valley but you were just I Would say that one\nStory broke get ... they're not yelling at a path that I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that after that it it is if the Kurds\nAnd what I feel like a fall out later that half\nOf it is the courage of phantom pain on really ever now oil\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to to say in regard to the specific topic of the arrest of the suspect in the uh the uh the phony bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has all week and I don't know if it's true and others have credit Wyoming ... black people in this state but if they had had happened ongoing arrests factory\nIn healthy people that were arrested for twenty three I guess that's the ...\nUh yes it it ... me as well of course obviously you can be arrested the many many many times ah\nAnd ah convictions or or what would matter in terms of uh of any ah what amounts to prior restraint but I see what you're saying that yes obviously something needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur Oleg ... calls in from Philadelphia tonight for the good evening [laughter]\n[noise] yeah and what's on your mind so I'm fine\nI'm I'm I as I saw was I got up on what you're saying where laws and you know person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from a pro active angle where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health\nIt's even more under served in the medical field things that are all and so maybe after somebody goes in so many times\nYeah they bought the on probation they put people on parole maybe they could have a thing where they uh put people on mental probation where they they go to a specialist at mental health professional and they get help and maybe if\nI got I think what's more acceptable in the first place that person would never get to the ways in their minds when they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are expensive that's part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and I'm from the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening in the first place that just vice less especially if the you know especially somebody could be better building bombs and they I Would I say get lucky they get\nThe bombs will go on to the fact that as something actually happens and people get the answer to prevent something like that with a little bit of investment is definitely something ICS priceless\nWell widely anybody that I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to do such that we can offer treatment to give ... let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is though we do need more resources in terms of mental health and maybe some kind of a if you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing\nGreg in Sioux City Iowa on the jumbo have a show of the arrest of a suspect in the uh\nSort of bombing case again since he has told authorities that they were never supposed to go off so ... what trick columns things I don't know go ahead Greg\nYeah tell me that this is about as\nBad as believable as the ... the thing that has been and once they set up for this guy from day one the whole thing is that is to try to ah bring Cynthia and support for the for the Democrat but older really holder was one of the targets I couldn't believe this maybe six ... six years ago\nBut this is such a much BS unbelievable\nWhen I went on I mean older was granted he tended to pick a has been or never was targets that's very true but there is a I I'm not sure about why when you say is set up I mean it sounds like the guy was set\nUp Jim Jim this okay how do you know he was at a quote set up and by whom and that's when I get a\nCall ... ... oh my goodness who worked at the CIA or does it does\nTheory you're saying you're saying that you have knowledge that in fact the Democratic party establishment a hired to seize are saying look\nI Would not put it past that I Will not I would not\nWell okay so it is not a case of you know that at all it's the case of Asheville\nBut I I'm not going to believe anything at this point it is so phoney and it's so unbelievable that that he found that are like what are we just put a like a ... they asked me they're staying on the outside say bomb inside it was so unbelievable can they get start that a lot of this whole thing and it just\nMay be irrational buys this maybe they would have made it more believable for you I don't know more to

could add up to forty eight years in prison\nRe made it clear that the devices in the packages were real and dangerous\nThirteen IDs were sent to various individuals across the country each device

good evening\nAnd uh and I can say a lot of things and I credit when I first heard this today I just decided to let it sit there and not looking at for a while I was thinking about you know wait until\nSomething started falling into place that I I'm just going to add pose that question and I can't answer this question actually 'cause I Can't see that other people could look at the at pictures of him at Trump rallies number one ... whether they like photoshopped\nNumber and number two and a lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County and they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County and the place of people even if you when they occur on a vehicle you're going to get ... you're going to have your air vehicle\nNow attack scratch whatever it's going to be I mean people are going to go after it and that ban let you know like it was you know not attacked or nothing with that and Kelly\nAnd so I'm kind of interesting observation I\nSaid yeah there are pictures out there that the the show him apparently at the at the Trump rallies although I Would agree that uh\nThat does certainly this was the day and age when when bumper stickers are virtually any kind of a can they can get your uh your uh your car uh vandalize the interview that just says you're a member of the Rotary Club it would seem to this day and age it doesn't take much to set off some people out there\nAnd then ... year old Broward County ... car is covered when in kind of stuff and all kinds of stuff in it it's just it's it's just curious and um there are a lot of curious things about this way you look at it so I just thought that I Am and they just think about those things\nWell I think those reports that certainly to do worse the worth considering limited I thank you for sharing that with this but I was eight six six by vote jumbo Stanley in Raleigh North Carolina Good evening Stanley\nYes good evening Mr ... thank you for taking my call why your question [noise] uh I have no doubt that uh I'm probably not as up to date on this story as you are do I have read as much from the secret service reports FBI reports as\nBeen available or several times in the last Fifteen minutes you've made the comment that\nApparently this gentleman is not capable or was not capable of taking care of his own affairs\nIf the bowl or was not capable of taking care of his own affairs a nowhere have I read that he was not capable of taking care of it on a fair so where where did you blame that from\nI get that from the all the various arrests were made this man and the various activities threatening to bomb a power plant at one point or other brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not\nYou have a basis they're under the law for some kind of a of a preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his uh his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people that have been arrested who has a criminal histories that pay their bills are that are able to take care of them\nSo they're not the fares are speaking of I I'm happy if he was able to pay his bills I'm Talking about all able to manage zone affairs without

comments and an apology\nWas in and that may for John could get on to apologizing or how they're he hadn't spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention his wife\nA menu of and said that a famous line apparently that a gentleman don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that may have been the uh the origin nation to that it is a credited describes living in in

quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\nWell I just wanted I yeah\n... ... the uh perhaps so I I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I Want to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\n... so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Edward Snowden's leaks ah you know the Snowden story he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAh ah you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans in this as a very surprising a lot of people surprising me and I started to read about the essay\nAnd history of being a sec when you read about the history of the NSA all roads lead to this guy William Freedman Elizabeth read many husbands guy he's considered to be the godfather you say\nIf you go to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade there's a large toward being by the way as in Maryland directly between Baltimore and Washington but go ahead so if you if you go to and if their headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bus William Freedman head outside of the auditorium is named in his honor\nAnd so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William a who was a code breaker famous code breaker I saw that his wife Elizabeth was also put brick yeah that's interesting right how ... how many husband and wife or cook raking teams can possibly be a and so I started looking for more information on most of that\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a a a link to a library Virginia private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had lost their before she died\nIn Nineteen eighty one day I just decided to drive down I Lived in Philadelphia\nSo I drove down to the library and I I went inside and I said hello and you shoot I saw that I was curious about the Elizabeth Smith Friedman collection and and they were very friendly and they they brought out box one\nOf the twenty two ah boxes that Elizabeth said last time I started reading her letters and I it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because\nAs soon as I started reading her her handwritten letters hundred years ago I was just a immediately taken with her and she's such a such a vivid kind of voice on the page and and the materials that library had where\nA or were the kinds of materials that any journalist and author would would walk to stumble across it was our original college diarrhea was there it was you know love letters that she wrote to William early in their relationship some of the letters were actually written in code what\nOne of the ... not ... like the letter of guards who else would do that right [laughter]\nRight yeah no I mean it's actually it's actually kind of a I mean it's lovely 'cause we we tend to think of\nSecret right writing a in secret messages as a way to\nUm as a way to hide things but for them it was a way to work [laughter] I like to bring them closely together and uh I was just the the the texture these materials was was just a very cool to me and I and I realized after\nSpending some time with them that are there was an untold story here that really good needs to be cold it was a story of you know this amazing hidden woman who was behind the developments of American intelligence and the twentieth century it's just kind of a genius\nWho solved all kinds of problems and fixed\nAll kinds of
