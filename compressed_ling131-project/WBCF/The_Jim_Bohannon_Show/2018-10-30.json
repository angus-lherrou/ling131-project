I Would do too I I Would to David's point also said this is that um\nI have spoken to some congregations are her from congregations that say even if they the option of an armed guard were were viable for them which in many cases it is\nSome of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them the feeling that they've ... related to terrorism or terrorism or the threat is driving in clearly that's an option you know clearly that is an option that's what they've chosen I also want to be clear is I'm not suggesting by any sense of the imagination and into your first point Jim\nHardening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there are I Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have\nIt is certainly preferred to do that than it is to station the armed guards if if if David so concerned about\nThe image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a an armed guard they're hardened target you know\nPut the overlay of hardened target in an armed guard there I'm suggesting of all of them heartening that target before you put a guard there at least seeks to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside of there so\nUh you know one of the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggesting we go to this I think to the degree that David saying the other thing is is is we we we have hardened targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we go to the courthouse you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protected that's a form of art and target\nAnd when you fly from point a to point B you go to TSA checkpoint there's a lot of scene and unseen things that go along there that target as hard as well too so let let's not\nParts too much on the word hard and you know harden means to to shore up to to defend where otherwise it hadn't been defended to strengthen to make more robust\nYeah in a less than a minute to go here if you could tell us what you do at security one solutions which is a website by the way security the numeral one solutions dot Gov\nTrue Jim worry as security services provider ah we primarily operate in the government and the enterprise a space and and that you know at the simplest terms uh you know we protect people places and things\nAll right uh suffice it to say that uh\nThere are there are things that you can do out there it is not a case of somebody throwing up your hands\nAnd uh and say do nothing nor is is the notion of trying to instill good will and people a bad idea but it is certainly no panacea of people who engage in such activities are pretty much beyond that level of persuasion although obviously trying to reach people in their formative years was obviously something else to pursue\nAll of them of things do consider and stay on the line Bruce we will speak briefly off air Bruce Alexander is the president of security one solutions we'll be back in the moment\n\n[noise] one of the sea of radio [noise]\nMan charged with shooting eleven people up at a Pittsburgh synagogue had his first court appearance one day you'll Marquez reports the alleged killer social media footprint reads like a road map of\nAnd he was particularly concerned about the caravan of Central American migrants and appeared to key on reporting from Fox News right wing social media and highlighted by President Trump's own tweets that middle Easterners may be mixed in with the migrants all claims without evidence\nNorth Carolina a student those dead shot and killed by a fellow student at butler high school and Matthew is Monday at one point saying was bullying that escalated out of control here's Charlotte Mecklenburg superintendent Clinton won't talk this is going to\nTake some time healing for trauma requires patience support at a community that cares and deals and facts and not rumors and innuendo\nThey built by security experts\nAnd they're built with security in mind it's harder to do that to old buildings\nBut today in Europe you can't go to a synagogue um without going through multiple ... metal detectors I went to a synagogue in Madrid a couple of years ago you couldn't go unless you a made an appointment in advance went to the synagogue the day before show your passport had attract\nThen you had an appointment as to when you could come I wanted nine thirty in the morning and my wife and I were allowed in and we when we try to leave a little early this night you know I don't usually stay for the whole service um they wouldn't let us\nThey said number no once you're in the building you have to stay and then when we left they made us leave two at a time and walk into different directions so you know synagogues or targets most Islamic terrorists will all over Europe and now of course there are a target of these kinds of ah radicals\nMore to come are yes was Alan Dershowitz you can follow him on Twitter at ... ...

I've heard that constant or if you see something say something that sounds so it sound but I I don't want to make it sound cliche but I I'm just curious ... has anyone ever thought of or is there\nLike an organization of volunteers a two state patrol the Internet to go out and looked through Twitter Facebook all the sort of things because I Know with this either say I there was anything but what the bottom and character in Pittsburgh he was constantly putting his anti Semitic rhetoric out there for the world the seat and I'm just wondering if\nIf there is any organizations out there that\nWill patrol the newer wild west of the world which is on the Internet to try and find these uh kinda close\nBy ... I'm not aware of such a group or are you\nI'm not aware of any group the organized group I Do know that law enforcement agencies and federal agencies to patrol the Internet\nDo these mental or resources allow\nThat's correct and they also depend on people like your caller if they were looking through the ... somethings\nPeople like your caller if they were looking through the Internet and saw something suspicious to call it is\nI I Would note a distinction and the two cases we're talking about in the business my language not anybody else's\nBut in the case of lead pipe bombs we seem to be talking about a total whack job and in the case of the Pittsburgh shootings were talking about a a a very dedicated true believer or two entirely different kinds of cases\nIn two different types of individuals you're absolutely right\n[noise] uh I'd be thoughtful about the best way to approach either one\nWell I mean I think that if we talk about say Iraq the Florida\nBombing suspect you you're talking about a very good law enforcement investigation that\nBrought him into custody within days of his first bomb being delivered to George Soros and the amount of work that the NYPD the joint terrorism task force in the FBI put into it\nTo be able to bring it to such a conclusion to come up with the print\nTo run the print determine where he was by licenses and then put it out in plate readers it was a plate reader so his cargo by that alerted officers to allow the FBI and swat and everyone else to move in the following morning you know\nWe have a call from mark in Huntsville, Alabama next they're good evening bark\n[noise] Hi Jim how you doing tonight and I think you\nWrite well Jim I'm I'm a little bit a disturbed and appalled now uh as I told your are your your your check in person you know that I'm an American black first I'm an American second on black\nNow what disturbs me Jim is this piece women side that synagogue or my American Jewish brothers or sisters go worship and he went in there and he killed them now\nThe part that really disturbs me about this whole thing is why do they have life on the table I hear live well he's going to be executed note there should be no life\nHe killed my American Jewish brothers and sisters only think on the table is do we kill him today tomorrow or next week oh I should not be on the table\nAll right ah and certainly I I understand obviously the motivation put forward by Mark Thomas ... uh for the record I happen to believe that the death penalty has a place in American Justice so many others of course do not your your thoughts about that\nI see the lowly sorry that police didn't kill him in the shootout that day\nAnd I agree with war that the ... is he is tried and convicted which is right in this country because we don't want to give up the rights of of of trial by your peers if he is convicted than I think he should face the death penalty\nAnd something to be added to that we have a case of what I call stupid lawyer drugs in this country past a certain number of appeals in a certain period of time you are playing games\nWith people on death row and I would argue that keeping people on death row perennially is in itself a form of cruel and unusual punishment I think there needs to be a limit or just how many stupid lawyer ... could pull there aren't that many ways in which\nReversible error and that and other bases legitimate bases\nFor appeals can be made beyond that didn't finish the sentence in my ... my view your thoughts\nI totally agree I Believe that a certain point in time you see your right to appeal if you can ... been convicted a case like this this is\nVery good evidence that he was the one who committed the crime that he was caught at the scene and if he's convicted should be put to death\nOr got about twenty seconds here tell us what you do at the sea and be protective\nAh we or a full service private investigation and high level security firm based in New York but work throughout the country\nVery good please stay on the line we'll speak briefly author Thomas Russian\nBomber detective with the New York police department is the president of the sea and be protective and investigative group their website is a\nC.

I found that President we have issues like that before it translates present it as little as ... hot and we will\nWay well that is the state of the world that we live in right now unfortunately that attend blame that on somebody and then political office that's just kind of a cop out in my opinion\nWould agree with you completely and certainly unfair to blame these incidents on the president\nBut it I think is fair to say that the president said themselves up as an easy target for criticism sometimes may not maybe not fair criticism but as an easy target\nA and he could avoid some of that if you would would simply go about uh about doing so let me ask you a doctor bench than about the state of a mental health\nSo let me ask you a doctor banks them about the state of a mental health care and facilities in this country right now I Would assume that you would be among those who say we need more of everything a clinics money a therapist or what have you\nOh ... absolutely right chance you know if it's not good for sure\nBut then there's plenty of room for improvement you know as a mental health provider in the field for Thirty years I've taken a pay cut every year because the rates of Medicare go down and the insurance goes with it and then where we were asked to see more patient and a shorter amount of time\nWhere you need a certain amount of time to make an accurate diagnosis that an accurate treatment plant and one individual can't find help and then they just\nGo further and further into back to ... and in many of these situations worse team that there is a history of at least symptom even that's not diagnosable mental health conditions about what we're seeing and America is that the American Psychological Association has found that\nFifty nine percent of Americans consider to be at the lowest point in the United states to drink and that's causing them strapped\nAnd although it might help if they if they understood something about American history well it literally the sixties only you only have to go back fifty years to find a comparable period of the bureau back a hundred and fifty years to ... the civil war and leading up to it it vastly exceeded today so again we have\nNo rational basis for that got us good worst in American history only says one thing that you don't know much about American history if you believe that\nI Would agree with your jammed button there in lies the problem that problem is that we're dealing with people's perception\nAnd their perception is their reality that whether we're talking about I'd gotten men are we're talking about you know I'm not they're concerned about the price of diapers it's obviously a facetious example but it goes to the fact that\nWe're dealing with people's perception and how they manage that perception and when he had some who have a stronger moral compass\nThan other sweat\nAnd that would dictate for them what is right and wrong and then they will behave in a court is kept\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six with Dr Michelle banks than back in the moment\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval\nFirst we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com racial upheaval", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Florence", "day": "30"}
