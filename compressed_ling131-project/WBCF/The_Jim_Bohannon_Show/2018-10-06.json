[noise]\nI'll go back to the general had a show one of these six six five oh Jim boat when I have six six five oh five four six to switch with Rob heavy general counsel and director of the center for the American future at the Texas Public policy foundation\nWhat lessons do you think we should have learned will get down to whether or not we have to admit it but but out of this debacle that we've gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now is the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president uh you know you asked him back in a way that maybe in past administrations would have been cold\nAnd I think the new gold the strategy of the ... had never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay and from behind and now than they\nAre that the pressure would be so great that ah he would have been withdraw the or she would have which all self and so in the face of these vicious attacks on them and as a stellar reputation\nThat tax on as a a stellar reputation it's had an amazing career as a ... a judge the lesson here is that uh we conservative stood their ground\nAnd the right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a less than ... Ford chew have courage and the convictions that our leadership in D.C are they're represented\nIn reality can you foresee a time in let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like this Supreme Court nominee will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\n\nI Hope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there quicker than that and then my my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back the bipartisan consideration that used to the traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being harmed not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail this fall the law the constitution and I think with that recognition you will see\nA less and hopefully end or the last attempt to hit the homerun cases to create brand new rights to the brand new protections that were never intended by by our constitution and so with\nThe next justice than with is already established as the new status quo the return to the respect for rule of law or that there won't be so much at stake it's you won't have hundreds of people getting arrested the capital over the nominee\nBecause we won't be in such a high stakes game anymore\nFor the judiciary for the highest court in the land and so maybe we can get back to considering the merits of candidates based on their inherit civil law that respect for the constitution the qualifications of their record\nAnd we won't have these cases that make you know every single nominee a life or death fight partisan fight for the the ... versus the right\nI Would hope that you're correct I I don't know if I'm terribly optimistic but one thing the whole notion of the judiciary as essentially governments umpire calling balls and strikes that's constitutional ... not constitutional\nThere are an awful lot of people out there unfortunately who don't really care how you get where you're going to the end justifies the means I don't care where it's in the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the vet center and so on\nA they don't care about that sort of thing they care only about getting their way and if that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators that's fine with them were not in many cases talking about very principled individuals here\nWell that's right and that say a Sin Nombre a sickness that it's come from the federal government that's way out of control but it's gotten way be on a government of limited enumerated powers it was ... by the founding fathers and\nYou know one thing and the overall theme of this administration has been in the ministry nation that has been looking at cutting regulation and decreasing the size of the power of the government being thought\nInch by inch every step along the way of but here I think in the way the judiciary is being transformed it's putting men and women in place that have that commitment at are rejecting\nThis idea that\nYou know every court case needs to be a policy that tree out we just have a court case that is correct all the law and that's what we expect to live on\nWell I'm certainly with you ah of course if that were to happen we would probably need to do a certain extent to be teaching young people\nTo feel that way and that's another area that I I wanted to get into with Rob Mickey and that is the extent to which we have taught\nYoung people to not only be have him in the the vicious and the self centered and they'll mattered way that we have seen but it also to to recognize that free speech is important them your feelings if they get hurt by somebody else says\nWell grow up to develop a thicker skin\nA though there are a host of things I think can be laid squarely at the feet of American higher education which are also discuss but as we approach or break I'll just note that we're talking with Rob ... general counsel director of the center for

are expecting taxpayer in this country can start a movement if you are I seem to find your university get together back together and say we're not sending their kids their\nThoughts of boiling\nThe state university for most folks that's where they have to send their child to school because that's what they can afford private universities\nOh that's where they have to send their child to school because that's what they can afford private universities are very expensive and it and in terms of intolerance one way or another I I only I don't remember the details of Missouri I did at the time but you know some years have gone by so I don't want to comment on that particular problem\nWith that particular incident or set of incidences\nOr however uh parents don't have options when when it comes to where their kids go to school it comes down to where they are admitted and what they can afford and often state universities do provide\nA you know and affordable way to send your child to school and you know if they're majoring in something engine like engineering or with this nonsense doesn't go on and they get very fine education\nAh sometimes better the private schools provide\nA but it really shouldn't matter whether it's a public institution or a private institution 'cause all institutions receive money\nFrom the federal government one way or another that's what title nine was back you have to get women you know you have to spend an equal amount of money on women's athletics or you know or you don't get any federal money for any purpose well everybody toe the line like Ninety nine percent because everybody's getting enough federal money that it wasn't just about athletics right\nWell I don't know that it was correct to do that but it would be correct to require\nA universities to get federal money to provide a hospitable environment to everyone but what happens when you get an Obama administration who basically tells schools to establish kangaroo ... anger ... courts\nWhere there's an absence of adequate due process\nBasic protections for the accused\nTo to deal with accusations of sexual assault\nOr you know we have to have a system that is robust enough to withstand an ideologue and the White House of one side or the other or we certainly don't want people enforcing conservative orthodoxy was things to do\nIs they get institutions focused\nOn preparing kids for the work place which is something oil academics don't want to hear about\nRight because it you know but the point is is that we have we have students with with lots of debt\nFor them to colleges did not fulfill the promise I'm applying to rolling then they enroll people that couldn't possibly graduate they enroll people into programs for which there is no real future they didn't find reasonable jobs they provide professional jobs you know about a third of college graduates I guess it is or under employed\nOr why not let that brings ...\nAnd you know if you if you schools the dormitories going up for auction would be enough to focus the mind\nAnd financial aid should be based strictly on the percentage of people in a given major\nUh graduates who are within one

which has the borrowing authority of the federal government it can it can offer them at low rates but it's some day they have to be repaid right\nAnd basically I Would require schools to finance fifty percent of the loans their students take out and to be the London window\n... let them evaluate who should get loans and if the students can't repay the loans than they are on the hook you say well

shift the balance of the court the right for generations in Washington ... reporting\nAnd let's talk about this tonight in the context of a gentleman who's written the most interesting book David

have you with us tonight good to be with you or what the assault are you speaking of in particular here\nWell I argue in the book that the court has been to interventionist too involved in American Life for half a century or in cases that liberal sometimes\nLike the outcome of conservative sometimes like but I argue that the court should be less involved should be more deferential to Congress and state legislatures and that would\nIncrease the courts prestige it would\nMake Congress perhaps lessen the bold than it is now congressmen and senators are altogether happy to look across the street and have the court\nFor campaign finance regulation his argument would be but its conclusion already because the first amendment says otherwise but as Elana Kagan's pointed out you're just

and presidential power there was barely any discussion at all about the role of the court and nobody would say judge Kavanaugh and when you think the court did best\nBy not getting involved that's not asking to discuss the specific case it so when is the court best do its job by not intervening ... thousands sixteen liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats all agreed\nBefore school his body had even cool ... but the next justice could determine American social policy for a generation why do why do the rest of us all acquiesce in that kind of power for the court\nAll right good question
