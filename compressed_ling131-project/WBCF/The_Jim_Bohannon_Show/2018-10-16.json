Council\nHis previous book is defeating ... the winnable war and the\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr Gorka you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of ideology objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subjective truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling of if you're caught this and the Kavanaugh hearing the Democrat said at the starting with Cory Booker used the phrase\nThe truth when talking about the test the Monday from Dr fold that is so telling the truth\nIs no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this post modern is this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics to be divided into two groups those who believe there is one truth\nAnd those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they\nThey create the atrocities of the twenty of them twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they're out to destroy the United states\nI mean I don't have the subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my objective truth\nWas wrong but there's there's right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no\nWay for them categorically that didn't buy your accusations so this is this is if the two of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon\nThat you can use against the the liberals that ... every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean the the the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nUh I'm I'm the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's the problem if it's a country such as Bangladesh will or elsewhere\nWhere it's ... becomes the legal system we're sure real law actually becomes the ... of the land of such as Afghanistan\nThan we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies but as a Muslim state\nBut we have to be specific about\nThe context in which country and who we are actually talk to you about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today\nTokyo about one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people of on the left uh pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat or you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\nYeah it's a very good question I'm disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democratic party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves as socialist a in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you looked at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the day was socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party or rather the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nOf managed to socialize this would make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to have this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAbdicated control of the education of our young people to people especially at the College of faculty level in many cases of have an absolute axe to grind and I'm very anti American ideology who are less and less likely to drive even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that\nBut in many cases we're talking about faculty\nWho are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor and presidents of these universities about been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America and demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allow the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\n... okay you guys had mentioned earlier that there is a subject of truth in that ...\nOr ... that is it is claimed that there is such that as such we both repudiate the idea but go ahead\nWell that's still just an opinion no matter how you know no matter how logical or no matter how uh how much feeling it's like any ... which is ...

GDP advisors and he is here to talk a bit about the increasing health care cost burden for workers who are sensibly receive coverage from their employers\nInteresting a germ of there are I suppose in the ... part of the students good evening\nGood evening Jim me on absolutely\nUm I I Know that that even as many people out there received their health care from their employers I think it would be safe to say that as a general rule employers everywhere are looking for any way every way they can find\nTo get out from underneath what they deem to be a burden and in some cases frankly a that is unethical at best and I suspect illegal at worst\nBut employers just don't like paying healthcare costs [noise] [noise]\nWell you're absolutely right to know I'll tell you they don't like it for a couple of different reasons one it's it's one of the hardest things to budget for on a piano [noise] because you have zero control over what the insurance companies are going to do\nA and then secondarily as a result of the Affordable CARE Act many employers are having to provide certain levels have benefits at certain rates and and can only ... you know\nShare the charges up to a certain level\nAnd so the this is the challenge I Will tell you that employers have found themselves in this predicament oftentimes as a result of how they've approached healthcare over the last ten to Fifteen Years\nWe don't think of health care from an employer basis like we think about everything else on the piano I run a business I have a number of employees and and when I think about health insurance oftentimes it's easy to think about that as a transaction [noise]\nBut I think about health insurance oftentimes it's easy to think about that as a transaction\nThe reality is is that our health insurance premiums are derivative of the health care claims that we generate and health insurance is just become healthcare financing that's really all it is and so as a health care costs continue to go up\nFor some reason employers in the United states don't think about health insurance like they thinking about everything else on the piano and the economic principle applies here just

solutions\nTo a health care problem that has not gone away Obamacare is still on the ropes of the Republican Congress has passed session could do nothing it seems about health care and yet the problem persists and it's a very real problem for many many people Lawrence calls from champagne Illinois hello Lawrence\nGentleman I can you time more orientation here is genie see is that sort of like a political candidates except you're selling ideas about health care\nWell first of all his GDP and this was as good a time as an aide to have done some explaining exactly what GDP advisors is\nOrange thanks for the question always like doubting our company\nOr we are a consulting firm we traditionally help advocate on behalf of employers as well as patients and members of the healthcare system\nTo try to navigate what is often times very confusing system to do so so our clients normally are corporations that are trying to help their employees find more cost effective ways to help navigate the system\nOr I was there anything else that you are you wanted to ask you about Lawrence\nThat's good I think I can make my contribution now\nUm [noise] I basically I'm a physician or the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high uh also ... ... ... back in the days when I charge thirty and thirty five and forty dollars for the gym in an hour\nI actually made more money that way then over the years as it went higher and higher a I Want to\nExpress my consternation and and and lack of understanding of what on earth happen there are those are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention except doing by a therapy keeping up mentally a medically competent and and my ...\nDoing my therapy keeping up mentally a medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything went off the screen and maybe you have some insights but\nUm I Want to make a point here that once upon a time I think the medical world was more\nUh like I was able to do it in the early days my practice of the people were coming in the hiring me it was their our it was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling in a constructive way that was going to help them\nResolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still they were in charge in that respect I think that's different than what your gentleman that we're talking about\nA yet I'm quite knowledgeable about the PBA ca and I understand the need to help corporations figure out how to uh buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\n... okay well let's let's get to that and the second or let's say on the line but uh your response or substance and\nWell there's a couple of things and when we're when a wry we've started to see that guy that I go back in the first part of your question or comment orange which was you know back in the day it seems different than it does today and that she has back in the day it was different\nUm as as we continue to monetize the healthcare system from a business perspective I've now you you know we can actually draw very clear and close\nParallels to what we saw in the banking system by two thousand eight we had the banking system a consolidated into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail we're seeing that same thing uh her in the healthcare system now health care systems aren't run by doctors any longer run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenge that we have here is that we continue to see consolidation\nUsed to use it you would have an insurance company in conflict with a hospital system or a doctor system trying to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of health care they're no longer doing that\nAre actually working together the working together because the health ... as a result of the Affordable CARE Act insurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit per the AC a at Fifteen Percent now if I'm a CFO and the c._e._o.\nOr Wall Street based organization I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin I Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my fiduciary responsibility is to my shareholder not to the patient the by my product and this is part of the challenge we have in the healthcare system where the finance companies ... responsibility is to the shareholder not to the consumer\nAnd so we started to see this move when I got into this business over twenty\nYears ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred and fewer insurance companies are in the market\nThey've gobbled up the market share and now they're going to a hospital systems and working in a line that used to you would have a doctor and network with one maybe to insurance companies now every doctors and network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leverage to bring down the cost of health care\nIsn't true at all discounts don't matter anymore prices do\nAll right uh the say the least that covers quite a bit to the thing that you would like to add to that Lawrence\nWell I can add and bring up the the second point a sandwich and he said I think um there's something strange about a\nA doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrator Z a most hospital administrator is to have a bachelor's degree\nOr they couldn't ever get into medical school yet or doctors who are no more and are smarter actually let these people run the entire ball of wax now related to that I think is the need to get these costs down\nHospitals are even worse than a duck prices a the ... and the\nQuality we're coming up on a break here that doesn't move I Do want to hear what you have to say but we're going to have to pause and do it after these messages [noise]\nNews talk more than one WDC radio\n[noise]\nAsking some tough questions in Riyadh an jak Callahan Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo was due in Saudi

happened we're talking about the whole situation with Saudi Arabia that you've been reading about I'm sure very much but uh it's a terrible situation there's no question about it I don't like it one bit\nThere are multiple reports that the Saudis are bound to acknowledge that go she'll be died in the consulate partial possibly from a harsh interrogation Senator Marco Rubio till the Fox news at night the U.S should demand answers\nYou walked into that building and there was no video of him walking out so either he's still in there somewhere or he's dead on that's really the only explanation for it and there wasn't any are leading the facility and I think common sense tells you the Saudis would have produced and who did it how they did and I think we have to assume the worst and we'll see

met said dad Martin half an hour counts and therefore they Rob Peter to pay ...\nAre you are you still be talking about the practice of taking money out of the Social Security trust fund which of course has been done for a wide variety of things and in fact a\nLot of people think that there is a in fact an account someplace with all of that uh that fight go withholding when in fact there's nothing there but um I Do you so I'll I'll address that question with our guest the substance of so\n[noise] well listen I mean yeah this is [laughter]\nIt definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um due to look to move the money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is\nReally insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now and the money that's going out while it may have cash in the coffers from a standpoint of we weave the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways they're borrowing\nAgainst the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the well we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all\nA would be effectively just a massive\nAre the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nI'm with a baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created\nTo ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retired shaving [laughter]\nRight and so but we distorted that in a way that now because of the advancements of modern medicine what you're good we're outliving the system or at least the system the way it was set up and unfortunately this is just the way that government has unfortunately operated for decades not just recently\nMore to come back at the

directly to the drugs are caused a my issue was I was listening to the gentleman talked about the dentist writers and how they're going to hospitals and the big\nThey are takeovers and my wife is raised and lasers recently graduated from nurse practitioner school at the at er nurse practitioner from a small town in Missouri this is\nJuno she got multiple grants going through college who are there because we are provider deaths that area you know all this stuff and now none of none of this place will hire to specialize\nA they say that you know she was a family nurse practitioners that said the whole family is that a ... it's just a big mess the whole health care system just a mess\nOkay ah how 'bout that\nYes the whole health care system just a mess\nOkay how about that that mess or said\n[noise] well I think ... to to ban I mean we're seeing the same thing where oftentimes again that is a lot of his his geographic it depends\nOn the region and how many hospital systems are available obviously if you're in a more metropolitan area the opportunities for more specialties are there\nThe challenge when you get into more rural areas again is that those hospitals have to generate revenues and they don't have enough money to isolate to to pay toward specialties but specifically when it comes to nurse practitioners and and I think that the nurse practitioners arguably one of the most deem valued\nOr resources in the healthcare system these people should be lifted up that should be valued they should be utilized more to engage\nThe consumer in a in a healthier lifestyle to really understand educate to walk people through it [noise]\nAnd unfortunately they're not utilizing the way that they need to be utilized which is really to engage in a higher level\nInstead they're utilized almost to bridge the gap so that the physician can go find those higher cost\nIssues to to direct their attention so I think that what nurse practitioners that unfortunately become pigeon holed in our society is in the kind of the big gap fill to make sure that they can prescribe the antibiotic that their life has to do that and move on and so what's been experiencing with his wife is because of her specialty\nShe's limited and the resources that she can provide a broader scope of people and unfortunately the hospitals don't realize the value of what
