Johns Hopkins the conversation these last weeks it's been the question of civil war in the United states a sharp words and or violence violence has been pending and there have been actions in the streets\nNot clearly about the partisan divide\nHowever in these last days there have been exceptions and I remind all of us you cannot be certain you're in a civil war until afterwards that is the case for every civil war going back to a thousand years to the Romans so we're doing some guessing here Michael a very good evening to you I report\nThat earlier in the week as we all know Mrs Clinton used in temperate language on CNN\nAbout the partisan case that the Democrats make running up to the mid term election and in her language she said that it was possible it was likely it was intentional not to be civil in these days because and then she gave a reason not to be civil\nWithin these last hours I have a report from the chairman of the Republican Party in New York state at Cox that the New York state Republican Party headquarters at the Manhattan Republican club on eighty third straight he stayed he Thursday was vandalized\nVandalized by unknowns at this point the investigation is underway including having an F ... is a large letter ace spray painted on the front door a for anarchists and having the security system interrupted with Gump there was poured into

not apologize those of good conscience and clear mind no this state of oppression\nCannot remain the U.S fascist political system is one of the most Savage institutions in history and we will combat it relentlessly until all our free of America as barbarism that was left behind the threat\nAt Cox tells me a CCTV camera recorded the attackers it was very early in the morning neighbors ... called the police but they were too late 'cause the attackers were way they were two men\nAre large or small unclear but they were wearing hoods so their faces recovered\nThat's consistent with other things we've seen in Portland Seattle and New York and Washington hooded men but at Cox emphasize the word professional\nSo Michael I turned the square one more time you warn last week and over these last weeks that our fellows will take advantage of our disorder\nThese last week that our phones will take advantage of our disorder disorders in front of us misses temper uh Mrs Clinton using in temperate

this situation we now inherit with days left to the midterms with Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder making in temperate remarks with actions in the streets and this report of an attack on the New York metropolitan\nI'm a Republican club on eighty third street by men wearing hoods who are acting according to add Cox in a professional matter in other words anarchists\nAre we seeing them everywhere and they're not Republican they're not Democrat they're anarchists but is that the forest that's on least by the language of the leadership and you make the case for that Michael so I Want to press you on this what in this escalation cycle is next to watch for we've had our painting of Sumner that was Kavanaugh\nWe now have individual actions of renegades or outlaws or red flags that's what they call them in Missouri or the riders into Kansas the men who rated Lawrence where is that what next to watch Michael\nWe have permission granted by the leadership at least a blue not quite yet\nBut we have the leadership of you to sanction more aggressive actions direct action\nAnd that is translating already end of the kind of situations and and as you describe and that would correlate to say the kinds of things that emerge in Kansas and they\nHave to say if you have the right on Lawrence right\nAll right but also you have a more generalized um\nAcceptance of the the need for a resistance as the only possible way\nThat would be that people negating national ... national laws say in California or in cities that are underway defiance of the the center because it's regarded as illegitimate\nNo the only way an election outcome that was positive for the levy that would be to suddenly shift\n... that would be to suddenly shift focus to blue legislative\nOptions but if those took a turn that inflamed read then you would have a situation\nWhere only talking impeachment Michael that's all I hear from from the man who was a Pill Head of the Judiciary Committee who is a representative here in Manhattan he's talking impeachment not only of President Trump but also a ... capital\n[noise] so what you have is that there is no longer a belief that governance however you define governance whether it's a Supreme Court decision or or laws statutes that are passed by Congress no\nAct of governance can alleviate theirs and in fact any decision in any uh governments fair only inflamed\nThe situation so this is where I come up with this idea of of a curve that that at some point gets beyond control that there's no way it's called back\nAnd you know other countries like China saying this understand but this is there a moment\nTo potentially intervening once the U.S is fully a mobilized to achieve all of their objective\nLook what they just did Michael they disappeared the president of Interpol in front of everybody\nAnd have no explanation for it he says he resigned his post he's a member of the Communist Party in fact she's a senior figure in the ministry of state security and they're that China is arrogant to the point of believing that the international community can not in any way make them pay for that\nMoment the president is um through some sort of event shown to be\nNot in charge or to be a\nMade 'em impotent in some form an impeachment would be one of those processes at that moment something will happen abroad and that will be an earth shattering historical moment for the United states in the world and the the\nThe people who to cry or the president will have been in effect those who have brought this\nIs Michael there is a reason to make the case now that it's already too late for this that we can stop it that the escalation cycle there there's pleasure and the escalation cycle for too many parties China Russia to name too\nBut also those allies who are not all that friendly say Germany or Great Britain already going through their own disorder\nAnd that uh with the American superpower weakened by internal drive\nOr our allies and our phones believe they gain another word that maybe it's there a moment to take a chance\nAnd we're not we're not prepared to defend ourselves Michael were not an estate I I Do not know if the Democratic party presuming it takes control the house I don't know if they'll follow the constitution I mean going after the president with\nCharges of impeachment based upon you understand that that kind of disruption makes that makes America I'm disorganized to the point of not being able to defend itself\nWill people living in the moment who are\nWrapped up in the beliefs that they are in charge\nOr we have less than a minute Michael go ahead I represent\nThe leadership those sorts of people are not I'm sensitive to nor are they attuned to shift in which the entire situation ships and there\nIs today I think a larger atmosphere shift in which expectation is now the driving element in other words the Chinese\nAnd the Russians and of course even the Europeans

trade war increase the first President Trump says he will not by our Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell but does blaming out of control U.S Central bank for the worst stock market fell off since February President Trump also telling reporters in the oval office\nHe knows monetary policy better than the feds leaders\nHe also continued to criticize them for interest rate increases\nI think the fed is for too stringent and they're making a mistake and stuff right [noise] and it's a despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do believe there\nLet's bring in Bloomberg News the White House team leader Alex Wayne is going to still is in on everything we just heard first let's start with a with the president has been saying about the Federal Reserve said that they had gone crazy or told Fox News if that had gotten too cute and now saying that they're making a big mistake how does this\nHelp I I'm really enjoying the White House line on on what's going on in the markets is both according to the White House a long overdue corruption\nAnd also all the fault of the Federal Reserve um you know look like the president likes to uh like to have 'em Dylan she likes to do that he likes to be able to pin the blame for for stuff on\nPeople and uh apparently the Federal Reserve is going to take the blame for ah for the stock market slumped this week\nIt kind of reminds me of when and he talked about ... when he was a candidate Trump and he talked about how the election is read everything is rigged I mean it was sort of setting it up just in case he didn't win and then with Jeff Sessions talking about how he's a failure and everything and sort of setting him not to be the sort of reminds me of that\nFellow puck is another good ... he's a lame do puck for for high oil prices this way it's because of that not not his you know nothing is ever the fault of his policies for example high oil prices prices are not the result of sanctioning Iranian oil and keep it off the market it's the fault of OPEC\nUh the stock market's wound is not the fault of or his terrorists and his trade or China the fault of the Federal Reserve\nAnd want to go back to something else did she say because it was the treasury secretary the finish and talking to Bloomberg News uh when he said that this is long overdue correction is it because they are not on the same page or like you said this\nStrategy Trump tried to tried to match the two ideas you said it's a corruption caused by the Federal Reserve\nSo you so it's ... it's you know it's now that there is no strategy behind that Trump's not being advised by anybody to to attack the fed as far as we know uh it's just ... this is how the the president responds to to ... negative a news negative developments in the world he he looks for a villain\nIn this ... not a negative development as raising interest rates\nDoesn't like rising interest rates I'm just like probably no president likes rising interest rates but other presidents don't or they felt like they should keep their hands off the fat that they should let the central bank be independent not even ...\nBut one thing that I think it probably bears watching is that these economists who sit at the IMF in at all these other multilateral bodies certainly do mingle with and mix with condom is to directly influence\nPolicymakers had the Federal Reserve at the ... within the Trump Administration\nAnd so sort of period that channel I think you could see a world where were these sort of recommendations and concerns get get relate and and really get out within the administration within this policy making rooms\nSo do you know what are you seeing as trends are the risks still rising are they starting to plateau where are we with that or is it still and that's better than expected\nBecause what we really don't know is where some of these Chinese terrorists are going to head going forward you know how how that situation gets resolved extremely unclear and and I think that's the big question\nAnd UPS actually has been warning 'em in their research you know it's that you know we are already starting to see some of the trade related issues work its way into the data you know if she if you look at\nUm specific imports that were affected by the terrorists they went into effect in July they do seem to have actually fallen off you know the value that were important and has has really sort of wiggle it as a result of the terrorists and so they're saying you know you could see more of an effect from this and people are expecting\nOr what a great way to tear up the weekly you'd go research rap because one of the research papers that you wrote about in this week's a round up is about a trade policy and through to fix what sort of ...\nSo it's really interesting because they what they really do is they take a look at sort of the early warning signal data and what they say is the you know where you really see it taking effect in light things they're easy to transport to\nThat the one that they they really sort of dig into and they say you know the things travel by air and they just plummeted in July when the terrorist went into effect other things that are slightly heavier that might take a longer time to reroute haven't seen as much impact and that just means that those impacts could be coming down the line\nOn and they also point to a lack of job growth and manufacturing related sectors\nI'm all for the last couple of months in states that are heavy producers of things that were impacted by terrorists and they say that that could very much be a terrorist effect and it's something to watch going forward\nAt Goldman Sachs has been quite an worried about terrorists they say that you know yes we're seeing more and more um tears come down the line but they just haven't had an appreciable impact on growth yet and are unlikely to do so so I think\nYou're seeing some people on Wall street getting a little bit concerned you're seeing many remain pretty uncomfortable\nAnd I think it's going to be interesting to watch how this plays out you know as the IMF weighs in on it and as other institutions weigh in on this whether people remain sort of you know on worried here\nWhere you were talking about job growth as it relates to that and the other side of that coin is is the wage gains a Morgan Stanley saying that workers are really do right\nI think at this point we can kind of say you know the U.S economy is looking pretty perfect\nI'm In my family is kind of putting the cherry on top here they're saying you know at a time when we're seeing really solid close we are also expecting above three percent job gains starting in October\nAnd and the reason that they felt so confident that outlet is that wage gains have really gotten a lot more comprehensive they you know their broader there across the entire income spectrum right now and they're also across multiple industries\nIn a way that we just haven't been seen throughout much of this rut uh extension and after the recovery um and so they are feeling good about the situation in and saying that you know we're going to be a while well about three percent by the end of next year and so at the very positive outlook for Morgan Stanley\nAn update to the outlook for said policy going forward\n[laughter] so I had there has been a lot fed speak over the last couple of weeks\nI'm as I'm sure you guys have noted but I think some of the a couple of the interesting things that are really stuck out to me is one that they are so aggressively watching inflation expectations right now you know drone pow gave a speech in Boston last week\nUm and it really sort of zeroed in on this idea that you know even if it's a little too high or you know if you know regardless of sort of what happens in I mean what they really are worried about is making sure those inflation expectations stay anchored\nOn and said that was really interesting forward looking statement\nUm and then what we've heard from sort of the broad swath of speakers who have been out on the circuit is that they just feeling great about the economy right now you know this is everything they want it it's low unemployment at Siebel inflation around two percent and wage gains finally seem to be kicking in so it's a good outlook right now\nSo is it is another quarter port ... or ... for the summer\nIt's looking pretty good Kaplan I was I was a cap on this morning and he definitely seems pretty comfortable with it a December rate hike\n...

records when you once again here's what\nWe should research shows that many you as teenagers are skipping books\nAnd other print publications in favor of social media will the trend continue with the story here's info tracks genius to disco Gina\nBanks Chris a new study raises concerns about what digital media is doing to teenagers ability to focus for long periods of time and read along the articles skills they're going to need in college to understand complex issues\nThe study quantify teenagers use of digital media\nShowing their consuming much less traditional media like books newspapers and TV joining us now is the study's lead author Jean ... author of the book I Gen and professor of psychology at San Diego State University professor before we dive into the nuts and bolts of the study\nFirst tell us what aspects of digital media might leave a teenager struggling to read those college books\nWell social media for example usually just has shored bets attacks\nSame thing with when you text the friend it's usually not going to be a few paragraphs\nAnd overall when teen spend a lot of time on digital media they tend\nTo switch tasks really quickly they'll do one thing and then a few seconds later do something else the other aspect is they spend so much time on digital media six to eight hours a day during leisure time that doesn't leave a lot of time left over for things like reading bugs\nAnd it's not just the short messages but the computer screens blast them with too many choices for their attention\nWell that's one possibility and we need more research to explore that but certainly if you spent most of your leisure time switching between tasks every few seconds it's going to be very difficult to sit down and read a book for more than a few minutes at a time\nAnd as I understand it from your study the concern is not just will kids learn the material in college but can they actually go ahead and think through what the material means and how to apply it is that part of it\nIt is because\nThe Internet gets us access to so much information and it's great for that but it tends not to be asked conducive to reading long form tax so long\nAnd to be as conducive\nTo reading long foreign tax so long magazine article or a book you can read that on line\nThat isn't what team seemed to be doing their spending a lot more of their time reading these shorter snippets of text and those are just not as good for developing critical thinking skills and really understanding complex issues\nAnd even though people download entire books as you were suggesting on electronic readers I understand you made a startling discovery that knew that reading itself has actually declined in the next generation\nWho we found was there's been a really large decline in the percentage of chains you say they read books magazines and newspapers almost every day back in Nineteen Seventy six sixty percent and by twenty six day and it was only sixteen percent\nThere's also been big up tech and a number of tend to say that they don't read books for pleasure at all that used to be only around ten percent in the Nineteen seventies and then by twenty six day and it was one out of three\nSo in terms of the overall media use than anywhere hinting at this before let's take the twelfth graders are they the ones spending about six hours a day on digital media\nYes the twelfth grader spend about six hours a day and just three digital media activities general time on line which includes gaming texting and social media it doesn't include things like watching videos on line so the actual numbers probably higher than six hours a day\nAnd how does that compare with tenth and eighth graders\nTenth graders was about five hours a day and eighth graders about four so it tends to grow as they get older\nWe're visiting with gene ... author of the book I jammed and a professor of psychology at San Diego State University on a new study about teenagers use of digital media professor isn't this trend toward teenagers using more digital media rather than traditional media affecting their intelligence\nWell most studies suggest that IQ has actually increased over time that each successive generation\nActually gets a little bit smarter but there's a big difference between I care and things like reading ability\nAnd then also the ability to think critically and also to understand complex issues and also they have the attention span necessary to read the long form text that will help develop this critical thinking and complex thinking skills\nSo they may have the intelligence but is it possible that they're reading activity or lack there of is inhibiting their ability to use the leverage that intelligence\nIt certainly could be and you know what's so interesting to me is that reading books has actually easier now than it was before the Internet it's really easy to order books on line and it's also easy to read books on a tablet or on you know in a reader\nSo you can buy a book and read it instantly and that counts as reading and those questions that were asked to teenagers because when they're asked if they read books and magazines and newspapers it doesn't specify format it could be on a digital device yet reading is still declined\nLet's talk about what makes a person well rounded in life I saw on your study of graphics showing that among eighth and tenth graders\nFrom Nineteen Ninety One to twenty sixteen going to a movie at least once a month which is another traditional media activity going to a movie dropped from Seventy percent near fifty percent can you draw any conclusions professor about what this does to teenagers social development\nYeah that's the interesting thing you know my best guess\nIs the teams are watching just as many movies and possibly even more than they were ten or Twenty years ago but they're watching them at home instead of say going out with friends\nWith the traditional teenage weekend activity though with a group of friends to go see a movie and that's now less common so movies have become more of an individual experience and less of a collective one\nAnd there are certainly some advantages to that but it also is one of many indicators that teams are not spending as much time with each other face to face as they used to\nProfessor should schools in grades one through twelve have curriculum that not only requires long form reading but actually teaches children about what you're talking about today the effects of consuming digital media as opposed to traditional media\nI think the most urgent need is that education teach students how to evaluate the information that they find online so they need to be able to think critically about the source of what they're seeing and learn how to question\nSome of the sources they may come across think that's one of the most critical skills and the digital age\nAnd of course parents already have a lot on their plates just paying bills with keeping the households running but can they do anything to keep their kids interested in reading long form in developing these skills that you're talking about for critical thinking\nWell there's the standard advice to have a house with a lot of books in it that they're around and easy to access\nThe other piece of advice is simply that\nDigital media should not be taking up all of teens leisure time and for many teams that is the case so I think as parents\nI three kids myself like our role is to set limits and we'd set limits on how much does or our kids can have and how they can stay up and I think digital media should be no different that there should be a limit on the amount of time\nKids spend with digital media\nThe research suggests that can be up to two hours a day that's still a fair amount of time\nAnd that's enough to be able to do a lot of the activities that they love to do and gather information and keep in touch with friends and so on but it's limited than that allows enough time for these other more beneficial activities such as reading books and magazines\nProfessor gene ... author of the book I

within the root for having me talking about the first of all how you became involved with the association\nAnd your personal story with Parkinson's\nWell I Am I'm a serial volunteer so when my dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's about two years ago\nI did not want to just sit around and do nothing about it says I automatically jumped on to see how I could help and I joined the junior board\nAt the Alabama talking concession so your dad how old was he when he was diagnosed he was diagnosed at age sixty eight um but for years before that they saw he had what's called an essential tremor but the tremor got worse and say\nAt the nagging as my mom and I he finally went to see a neurologist at you may have been diagnosed\nAnd I he finally went to see a neurologist at you might be who diagnosed him with Parkinson's um which there is no blood test it's all a diagnosis I'm from just symptoms\nAre so symptoms and when you're talking about those symptoms you mentioned the tremor which is some sort of shaking hands and\nWrite it sat my dad for him it was shaking in his um right hand\nAnd then if it stopped it would kind of got to the left hand but not all people experience tremors with Parkinson's um\nIt's a rigid it a rigidity in the muscles um\nThey might start to shuffle their feet um maybe lose balance Parkinson's\nLooks different for every single person um my dad has a very mild case according to his neurologist um his case we think and we can't say for sure but he is a Vietnam veteran who was exposed to Agent Orange and the war and they think that that might\nBe patrol a trigger for the disease\nOr they're not sure then what causes Parkinson's or where it originated or is it a genetic disorders or ... you know a hereditary\nI have asked that question and our doctor said that is not genetic but\nA lot of people on the Parkinson's board have several family members who do have Parkinson's so there\nMight be a propensity for family members got at the new ... not sure I'm not sure about that it's a mystery you know and it's so important to the research dollars continue to come in and we're going to talk about research on what's going on with it and there's a bigger voted Birmingham coming up\nWe'll get to as well but when you first noticed your dad do you notice should've himself or did you and your mom notice it first started how did it come to believe that I did\nBut we got to go down to your doctor\nWhen we notice the tremor and his hand and it just got worse\nAnd we noticed um one other symptom of Parkinson's is that they lose expression in their face and my dad has always been a very um\nJust funny um he's a character road so losing that expression in his face I mean we really did notice that his personality has not changed for him but they just kind of had\nA blank stare as what they say um and so in that kind of got worse and we notice sometimes he wasn't picking his feet up like that shuffling we talked about um ... my mom and I were like you've got to get this checked out\nThough you mentioned are relatives who'd services or a ... a brain thing it's not a muscular\nIt is and rain thing yes and um they are lacking something in the brain called el ... mhm uh which there is a medication that they can take to help ease the symptoms but there is no cure for Parkinson's disease\nAnd but that's not a death sentence um\nWe have heard over and over again that you do not die from Parkinson's you die with ... it'll be something else a drive with you know plenty Billy Graham had Parkinson's he wrote a Ninety nine bright and directly\nSo the medicines they give you talking about raising the upper levels right over what else do they do for Parkinson's to help people deal with it and maybe\nWell the thing that we did my dad\nDidn't really want to start off taking a lot of medication he didn't really need it but I teach exercise classes so I'm\nI kind of coordinated some exercises for him to do a exercise is like a medication for Parkinson's it's amazing um they need to work on um their voice we do a lot of counting very loud counting\nUm because they get kind of quiet and they're boys so I'm swinging their arms

one billion dollar commit but from Saudi Arabia\nSo\nAt this point he's got a I mean he'd looking at a big big big big jak I Know he's a billionaire but I mean about a billion dollars there's still a big deal to him so are people putting money over their morals and ethics\nI thought that yesterday to some extent but the more I read and the more I listen to more I uh find out who the parties are you know all of this the more I think\n\nThat there are there's a lot of suspicious of finger pointing going on or you can follow me on Twitter the address Ed Sullivan radio ah Jackie is I think you're right on the she says first turkey had a video of the murder\nThen ... you know we just have audio if he's been killed then turkey most likely killed him and we are framing the Saudis\nGlobal is don't want the United states and the Saudis to be allies\nThey want war and the U.S seems to be cultivating good relations with Saudi Arabia suddenly turkey comes out with his outrageous story and every global is grooming for the U.S to denounce Saudi Arabia and to quote do something\nSo this this to me is a perfect example of stories where you hear one side of the story and you make up your mind that's it I Know who's at fault here I Know who's guilty\n\nAnd so I at this point do we do we dare wait for a little bit of evidence\nTo find out what's going on because again you've got two people that do not like each other and turkey does not want the United states and the and the Saudis to be buddy buddy buddies\nAnd they don't want the Saudis to be a big partner with Richard Branson on his ah outer space companies\nBecause the Saudis are trying to reform and when you're trying to reform your shake it up a lot of people with a lot of money and a lot of power and there's a the knives are literally out\nSo I think this story it may turn out to be exactly as first thought that they got 'em in the in the embassy and they and they killed him\nBut I think we are a long way from a ... of knowing that\nSo now all these business folks CNN said we're out we're up but oh but but but will that Bloomberg oh we're not going to be partners on this deal no but we're sending our

what these countries are doing\n[noise] between themselves\nI don't know what's going on that's the problem we don't know I suspect I suspect that that they killed him um I don't know though I have no proof I don't have any evidence I don't have anything now they have videos of some private jets landing in Turkey from\nSaudi Arabia and the ... games of guys coming from two teams have guys going from there to the Saudi embassy and do their head and neck to all the ... is\nSet up how do you know it wasn't propaganda and upset in order to get this propaganda sent and I ... and cause a problem\nI don't even know if ... if a Saudi a citizen flies in our private jet I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the Saudi embassy\nI mean it's just what people do\nSo I don't know it was a well how this is going to come out but I don't expect that the that the Saudis are gonna say yeah we killed them\nThat's not going to hand out\nAnd the Turks they're going to be real happy to be able to come up with some kind of evidence you know to destroy the relationship that we've\nBeen trying to develop they ... they would love to you and you know the women in Saudi Arabia have just recently been given the right to drive although that's a real hard cross to bear for their\nFor their culture but the thing is they're moving a little bit forward and see the thing is is until\nSomething

when he built it he ran a runoff from the roof down into the French drain diverted that and it helped a lot but it's still moist\nAnd I'm asking if they didn't catch latest systems or they trench the perimeter of the inside of the calls space and and a seal off the systems that with him in a fire and some up and how they work and is that a solution to these kinds of problems\nSo first of all the roof drains were going where before you kept\nDown in French drain\nYeah that's not too smart huh\nWas diverted that and and it helped a lot but it's still moist under their\nParts so now that you've got the roof trains disconnected from the from the French train 'em or those drains extending out away from the foundation perimeter\nWell generally those streets are made up of algae or moss and they have more frequently on the north side of the roof because it's a cooler side of the roof and there's more she there\nAnd a product that you could use to address that is cold wet and forget it's concentrate you mix it up you spray it on the roof and then slowly but surely it kills\nThe algae kills them awesome kills the mold it's there and cleans the roof and so within a very short period of time you'll find that the roof looks bright shiny again okay but\nThat product come at a um a carry and hook it up to those are you actually do have to get up on the roof\nDon't believe it does I think you have to mix it up and put it in like a pump Springer okay\nAnd so you may have to get up there and just spray downloaded should follow the instructions are website is wet and forget dot com\nYeah and it is a product that once you get in on the surface you know over time it continues to work so it's not something that going to have to reapply very often so it is worth it if you can

can\nDo you want to try to stabilize the deterioration of the concrete\nYeah I hadn't kind of hair and I kept a bag of part at\nYeah absolutely first of all in terms of the water problem um this is a problem that happened after heavy rainfall yeah All right so you've got water that comes in after heavy rainfall I Want to make sure we try to slow this down so it doesn't happen again ... palms things of that nature is not going to stop this from happening again what stops the heavy rainfall from getting in\nHis outside looking at your gutters and you're grading making sure the down spouse or discharging away from the house make sure your gutters were clean the cars were soil slopes away from the house we've got an extensive articles actually several of them on a Monday ... dot com to search how to stop a leaking basement has the same advice\nAnd we talk about the proper drainage improvements so do that first and then in terms of the Congress itself\nYou can use a patch in compound quick ... has a patch in compound product you definitely want to use the patch and compound because it's designed to stick to the old concrete have you tried to put new concrete over it it's not going to stick\nSo they're ready to use patching compounds are trial applied there latex formula so it's easy to clean up but that will seal the old concrete and then once that dries then you can painted\nAnd what I Would look for is in the ... floor pain or the Toxie pain so I like because there there are chemical to or when you buy the floor paint you get the paint and a gallon can that's about three quarters spilled and then of course a partner you mix them together stir them up\nAnd then you apply the paint sometimes there is um an additive that goes in after the fact that gives you some texture to the floor helps kind of hide the dirt but patching first than having an epoxy paying will have that looking like noon no time\nOkay Hannah car lack\nQuick creek to you I K. R. E. T. H. quick creek concrete patching compound good stuff Mary thanks so much for calling a set a date money pit\nI got rich in Illinois and the line is getting some water I mean the foundation tells what's going on\nWhat it is or time I've got a ranch house where they walk out basement and on the walk out when you come out there is a retaining wall but it was about eight foot tall were meets the house it hasn't really separated from the house but\nThere is water they get in between and retaining wall and the foundation and then they read it bottom on a heavy rain and then teach back into the basement so trying to figure out the previous owner that had this houses\nPut something in there like a call ... some types of has got our time and\nIt's not falling down too much\nSo this is a gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you and by the way you can see all this so the cows come home and it's still going to find that on its way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating\nSo on the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there's some run off that goes towards the wall and yes there is\nSo what you're going to want to do is is intercept that run off so we don't get as much water that collects in that area where we want to try to do is limit the amount of war that gets in an area that just direct rainfall with no runoff that means\nNo gutter discharge no a runoff from higher elevations so the way we do that is is first of all examine the situation and make sure there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this work and work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with a with leaders in to the base of secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you could do is installed something called a curtain drained Richard it's really it's a rather simple drain you might construct yourself\nYou take a trench that's about twelve inches deep and twelve inches wide\nHe puts them stone a trench then you put a ... type\nOn top of the stone surrounded with more stone\n... he's a filter cloth across the top and cover with soil so it's all done it's invisible in the end of that dream that you just installed should exit the daylights somewhere so you figure out the best way to do that based on the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations\nThe fall into the trench come up to the pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting in that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area you will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leaving the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nRight well let's just say I'll probably do some uh get rid of landscaping because it's got a little green Bush along\nAlong that wall as well so yeah and that's a good point 'cause sometimes you can make the problem worse by having landscaping that traps water so just think in terms of water control here not in terms of trying to steal that water out and then they will be in good shape\nAll right thanks so much for calling them money pet now when\nBreakdown in your home you

[noise]\n\nHey good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to the house does radio network comedy DJ Dale jumps alone with our map behind the glass or guy here with us we're in the hospital studios and of course Bobby tea is in our studios good morning guys\nHey good morning everybody got a great show a lot to talk about a lot of new things in the news this week also Dale I Know a\nLot of uh you know of course the weather nobody can predict that what's going on there but a lot of other things in the news and the one of the biggest things especially as you know that when a hurricane comes about enough on shore like that who has insurers who does not that's one of the biggest questions and it was always wanted a big topic\nThat is hey so if you don't have what would that be called the hurricane hit your home but the water floods and you don't have flood insurance does that mean that the water did the damage or the wind did the damage or does it matter I guess it doesn't matter if you're if you're an insurance company\nWhere are you going to have an insurance expert\nOn that is a ... a good point there that try\nTo answer all these intriguing questions that we have of course ... talking about hurricane Michael to hit the panhandle of Florida then came up in Alabama and Georgia then to the Carolinas\nGot some more rain you know like they needed it stride but our thoughts and prayers are with all those that were affected I mean that was a category for\nWhen they came ashore was the highest category seven no it's fine but it was in the heat or ring right there it was just like two miles below category five cents so I mean it was a monster and of course\nYou've seen the video on I mean it looks like a bomb went off\nIn Mexico beach I I've never I Can't say it's right there is it it's in the ... kind of going down the Florida Panhandle\nYeah towards Appalachia bill yeah so yeah Mandela\nMatter if you noticed one thing on the news coverage a lot of that coverage was was captured by drones I don't know if you are oh it all that that's why they got so much information so much coverage of what actually happened because of some of these drones you ought to see the quality was incredible that can pinpoint exactly what was going\nOff well you can see the structures to guys you can see some of the the some of the homes I mean ... ... gays and they look ... and I still that brand new so they must have built them different then somebody else it had been there a long time\nIt's a lot of the older homes that were destroyed but the newer construction I mean the code of change obviously over I mean that's like I was hearing in Mexico beach I mean there was a lot\nObviously over I mean that's like I was hearing in Mexico beach I mean there was a lot of mobile homes down there but they have an ordinance now that there can be no more mobile homes for audience so those that were destroyed by the hurricane they cannot replace them with a mobile home what's that's really in my opinion a good idea\nIt is now what about ... another question what about the waters that a Lowe's owners just because it was the third show on search so that's not but I Wonder if they were also for now and then this air you got to build on stilts or or something like that or\nOr you know most of those beaches it's within a certain amount of ... feet or I charge or whatever that you have to them but I mean who could have predicted I mean you know they haven't had one hit the panhandle ... was it like since the fifties yeah so I mean it's just one of those things you just never know but again our thoughts and\nWent out my cousins do they call them from Kentucky in ... they they log in and all that stuff but\nAh but I remember Bobby she's due Angelina ...\nYeah that's right when she was she was good yeah oh good at it\nShe call and like I said and said Hi Bobby hey Julie and hey did and then then she\nGot old and sitting on do you out and\nThen she ... I mean she could switch right by me turn that voice on him and make the statements and say this stuff and read very well she's a great job anyway\nYes you're the one thing about bad at math is when when she gave her opinion she gave it from a you know from her from a teenagers are from I'm from the kid's\nPoint to be like them in other words if we wanted to remind the house and everything looked good on our side but from a kid's point of view you know it might be a it might be troubling and making you know 'cause that they're going to be undone are they going to be interrupted about their regular lives\nAnd that by ... points records and she said you know she said the best they can do is go outside stay busy [laughter]\nSo that's pretty good but ah I tell you a lot of changes but I just bombing photo phone I just have no ideal\nOh yeah there's a lot to come in and also they talk about that that uh television methods that are that flat screen TV they tell me a rose up into a box now instead of you know you're asking how do they carry it\nThere's I I saw a boxer folds down into and you just carry it like a a you know something about a three foot long box just transforming\nOn H. B. Y. U. carrying somewhere\nAlong the match how the ... I don't want to be delivered to my house Bobby Yeah now how how does that way by me have you seen the ... uh the measurement\nOh there's ways that I think a pound and a half or something like this very light yeah boxers heavier than it is right exactly yeah for shipping purposes and to be cheap [laughter]\nWell we talked about projection TVs you know the projector type thing and I I have friends of ours that man during the summer sometimes when it gets like this or maybe last week when you get a little bit cool ... where in the air but you get and uh then they take one of those big screen that's\nA nip in the air ...\nMinutes okay and I think that so but they would go out and got the projection TV and then they would put them in those big screens at building in and play the football games or stuff like that was pretty cool so but um I Want one of those roll up TVs man\nIt's coming I got three of them come in for what's in the lives you know I tell you the three on for Bobby one for Dale one for me that's yeah that's right exactly right and then they won't ever get to us 'cause there'll be in the store [laughter]\n\nSo uh listen to talk more about some fall home

catch you up on what you missed but in order to manage your cells\nEspecially especially in the face of challenges and challenging emotions and that's what we're talking about emotional intelligence here you have to be aware of the emotion itself and then you have to be aware of your own natural tendency is\nIt's really easy to explode and take the bait of the good fight\nAnd then than that inflammatory beast of anger when it comes over you but the problem is\nThat we use seriously stumped the growth of our emotional intelligence when we give ourselves over two emotions and when we let emotions take the driver seat and then direct our choices I never do that [laughter] me either [laughter]\nAnyway um all of its management come we're talking to the other people there the one where I live we have no ... yeah all theoretical through us know\nWhere it's located um all all of self manage it may comes down to uh making the best choices with whatever resources are available to us and

tuning in for any reason and you have to go before the show up as a be sure to head over to ... dot com and drop us the line and we would gladly hope you catch up on anything that you may have messed\nIn this segment we're going to look at something we're calling the powerful magical pause okay so like the ... because\nNow there's no maggots [laughter] I Do okay so here's how this happened I'm so somebody something happen so let's just say it's it's a person or thing\nThat happens it could be an it's an incident of some kind and this incident insights a very strong emotion like an anger or stress or fear right and those kind of emotions are are kind of information you can even feel the inflammation how do you fit your face get hot\nI'm your heart might be faster or you might get a headache pretty instantly I can feel all this happening on the inside of you\nThere's this very critical moment where you have a choice this is where the self management comes into place or self control comes into place using this one brief moment you have a choice and the choice is to give over to it\nOr to press pot now we're talking about the ... minute but first we're talking about when you give her to it so you get over to add that the they're\nNot kind of I Know it's easier it's easier to moment right then it's you know if you're that you have a much\nHarder ones that are I Know I had not realized back in ... and that's the problem like anger can easily turn into a rage oh yeah fear can turn into panic\nAnd there's so many like that you know like like anger can turn into hatred\nSo many things and when you give that emotion the drivers we'll or the steering wheel and you let them take over\nAnd they will steer you down a dangerous road and then you can't bring it back and I think everyone has experienced this at some point like you get mad and you let the race takeover and now it's like you just can't stop\nWell and you can't and I'll tell you for me anyway it's easier to let myself go there it takes so much self control in that split second but the ... the self control can then it's not hard\nRight and that's and that's kind of what I mean by in some ways it's it's it's easier to to press the pause especially with Iraq this over time because you're when you when you don't give yourself over to us you feel it rise and you press the pause\nYou actually give yourself the time in the space to you\nActually give yourself the time in the space\nTo\nProblem solve to care to decisions under control and actually there's a few different phases of this that we're going to talk about today okay so you're in motion you identify\nThat something's happening currently there is a red flag you know what I think you can envision that heat that comes up you like yeah monster trying to come to the surface to take over yeah literally possessed you and I get up and picture and say monsters right pause right right yeah freeze\nUm okay so now in this freeze there's the the first step of the freeze is\nTo identify what's happening 'cause like you said today Joe did you knew something was going on in the first moment you weren't exactly aware of what I was right on so you have to ask yourself what is happening here what and why am I feeling this way what's going on\nOnce you have a name for it then you can also ask yourself to very important question what do I need\nIn this situation what do I want [laughter]\nRight right what are my needs what do I want what's in other words what does my goal and then the tuition what do I really want to happen next if you're upset with a person\nThen you need to stop for a few minutes and figure out what you want in the connection to this person\nThat's hard to identify it is\nSo that's why this is important otherwise there's going to be no resolve if you don't know what you want you know what sometimes is plus has to happen with the person standing right in front of you and your mental brain yeah oh yeah so in a cashier is does something horrendously rude and you want to be like really you work at the McDonalds like [laughter]\nWhat what is your life like but you know what you don't know their situation and you're going to feel terrible about yourself when you walk out of there and you're going to feel like I was referred to that person and why you know I could have taken the high ground I could've but no I had to become this terrible version of myself\nAnd\nAnd so what you do in that moment when the person behave that way as you pause in the back of your head and I they're you know bringing you up or whatever you say to yourself to ever do I need to address is what's the best way to address this\nYou know you can you can win a small victory in that and you can say the first thing you can say to yourself as well you you got crap and your crap is getting ready to part my crap but I'm going to ... I'm going to have the victory over your not pulling out my\nRight and sometimes there is an action that's needed if somebody really is inappropriate\nThere are times where you actually do need to speak to a manager you need them to medically diplomatically you need to call you need to say in fact I had a situation in Starbucks I won't go into all the details\nBut I don't treat me badly oh like and it and I and I didn't I didn't blow up I actually I actually contacted corporate headquarters\nAnd I found out what the my rights in a situation where I went up to the counter and\nAsk as nicely they could because I was mad I said excuse me sorry what's your name\nAnd he told me his name I went back I report is the name and I let them handle it they gave me a Fifteen dollar gift card but [laughter] but you have to say what you're going this is yours and says as a person you want to have a relationship with if this is someone you love\nBefore you can find this situation you've got to remind yourself I Love this person and say what you love that this person because right now their mating badly right and you want to confront the person that you love and you want to confront all the good in that person so that's the first part the first part is the identification and that's where you press pause\nThe next step in the cause is to problem solve so now you have to think about what are your choices and the situation\nUm and again\nYou're going to walk your kids through this you're going to teach your children how to do this to when they're angry and you can see the anger coming up you're going to intervene and you're going to say OK pots let's stop for a second I Know that you feel angry I can see that you feel angry tell me what you're feeling right now give them the latitude to be like oh\nLike don't Tom to calm down don't Tom stop screaming don't stop crying he can't hit he can't\nMaybe use profanity what makes me angry than anything but when someone looks at me 'cause okay calm down no yeah I mean the favorite there had\nMany [laughter] so we don't do that to your kids let then expressed that and then and validate them I understand oh my goodness I'm so sorry honey that happened oh honey\nYou know listen let them talk about it and then then but don't let them go down this spiral where they get angry and angry and angry where you say let's go and the way that used to have a way out of that as you say what do you think right now\nYou want to come out of the situation what do you think you need to happen what do you want the goal in this situation debate that will shift gears\nNow that I'm going to say this if it's physical let 'em go run let out hit a batter a punching bag sometimes that activity does help so don't disregard\nThat yeah yeah well and and and oh my goodness we're almost out of time I can't believe it okay well we're going to head out to rape when we come back we're going to continue this conversation looking at the after

ask them what problems he was facing or what need he was trying to meet and then say let me ask you\nThe way that you went about it you feel like that met your need or do you think it created more additional problems like how do you feel the outcome was that such a great question to ask and one that needs to be a probably all the time but yeah\nThat is going to lead you down is this a healthy way or is this an unhealthy why they want to do it in the non prompting way yeah so you don't want to say like you want to give them the option to say something that you do\nYou want them to answer what they think you want to say exactly so as you say now did your behavior or solve your problem or did it create more problems [noise] [noise]\nWell he is going to be like a greater more problem you

gives them an open to be like well actually\nMaybe there were some things I'm Sorry that you felt upset about it but I felt like it did it on and you can talk about it I'm\nReally camp on how he was feeling when the problem occurred and then together talk about ways that he could have found that magic pot mhm what is the wise counsel he could have sought sometimes in that magic cause you have to seek wise counsel\nWhat was the wise counsel he could have sought to help him through it and when that happens he needs to go and say I do hope\nYou know mom I'm really mad right now and I need help

[noise]\nWhat am I live ... version [noise]\nWe're people talking about developing a kinder more gentle nation having a group of people a society of people who actually care about others people that care about other survival they care about each other's health and they care about other people's wellness and they go out\nOf their way to show it so how do you develop a nation like that where does that begin on today's show I'm Talking about being kinder being gentle and how in order to do that\nAs a whole organized group of people it has to start with the individual [noise] we have to start within ourselves\nIn our own life to facilitate date type of mindset that type of mindfulness and that type of not only internal feeling but also how the internal feeling actually becomes an external feeling an ex journal action\nI found it very interesting because often we want to do this blanket thing we want to have everybody be more ... be more gentle all those grades up and I totally agree with that but oftentimes we don't give people the tools to figure out how to do that for themselves\nYou know we can't do for others what we can't do for ourselves we can't give to others what we don't even know how to give to ourselves and we can't teach others what we don't know\nAnd so on today's episode of live your true life perspectives I Want to break down some concepts I Want to talk about how we can prioritize our health\nOn a daily basis I Want to talk about raising awareness I Want to talk about being kinder\nAnd bean I guess more you and everything you do\nYou know I find that oftentimes the reasons why we aren't exactly who we are all the time is because we feel insecure about it stressed out about it worried the other people won't accept us but I think it goes farther than than that\nI think it actually goes further end of the fact that maybe we don't exactly know who we are\nPerhaps we don't really have a good grasp on what defines us or how we want to be defined right why does something have to define us why can't we define ourselves\nI find it very interesting and I find that often times we ourselves the individual is the person that puts themselves down the most and yes I'm not saying that this world is a simple easy plays and everything you do is easy and you'll get everything you want no that's not the case\nBut often times we become\nThat's not the case but often times we become\nAlmost our worst enemy is not\nOur worst enemy we seem to find the change in the armor and we tend you judge ourselves over it we tend to be a little ourselves and we tend to see other people as having everything that we do not have\nWe see other people having the things that we think we need\nWe see other people are getting the alcohol aides are getting the job promotion um you know and all the paparazzi pictures what have you and we begin to look at that and judge ourselves as to what we have not achieved\nPlus call right now and we'll give you a discount

the deep end on perspective you\nBack live delivered you lie for sectors and I'm heroes Daschle verges\nOn today's show I'm discussing how you can be kinder and gentler to others\nAnd how you can be kinder and gentler to yourself\nIt all begins with us but we do for ourselves we can do for others but we don't know how to do for ourselves we can't do for others but we don't understand and what we don't know we can't teach others so obviously being kinder and gentler to yourself is very important to being that way to the outside world\nRight before the break I was talking about the number of suicides at eight hundred thousand number every year\nNew one every forty seconds and how for every one suicide is like twenty or something attempted suicides that go along with that\nAnd I find it interesting because I Believe that when we hit that level yes it's it's it's the rock bottom level but we had there was a way to get there and there was a way to maybe work to not get there I think there are things that we can do\nTo offset that even if it's genetic predisposition even if mom was depressed and dad was depressed there's still a way of overcoming that it's just like if mom and dad were both alcohol or here's a way of not falling into that trap there's a way of overcoming that\nYou know it's not like we have a sealed fate\nOkay and so let's begin talking about the six ways to prioritize your health how you can do that and and see what happens is when we prioritize our health it makes us um reflect more to ourselves we become kinder gr ourselves that shows that we care about ourselves do you see how this all works together and because of that\nWe can actually be more effective\nWeekend miss less work\nWe can be more there for our family and friends\nWe can give back more because we have more to give back here and saying we're not like emotionally bankrupt\nSo there's a lot of things that we can do here that are very powerful okay the first thing that you want to do so prioritize your health that I think is very powerful begins with sleeping one of the biggest things that I find when a client comes into my office is that they don't sleep\nSleep is not happening and if it is happening there at the four to five hour mark which is not that good at all\nI think it's interesting how our society believes that the less you sleep and the more you work the better you are\nAnd I agree that I Am a big time worker but without sleep you don't have that much without sleep okay without sleep we're not able to be very effective we might make a lot of mistakes\nAnd some of the career that you have out there you don't want to be making mistakes I mean nobody wants to make mistakes but surgeons doctors those kinds of things you got to really you know step up and ...\nMake mistakes but surgeons doctors those kinds of things you got to really you know step up and realize that your sleep really matters many of you out there take that for granted you think you got four hours but how are you really feeling\nAnd I think that it shows internally it shows externally and I think you have to be aware of that\nTo take care of your body to take care of your mind heart and soul and you got to begin with the good sleep one of my biggest things about sleep is that you really want to think about sleep\nOkay because I think the day is really kind of broken into like three parts and if you look at it from the perspective of the twenty four hour day right twenty four hour day many of us work\nAt least nine hours I Would say\nUh some people work eight hours but you know I'm closer to the ... the twelve hours Thirteen hour days and so that's already a large chunk\nOf the of the day and he had the preparing to get ready\nAnd then you have a leave having some sort of bite a dinner I'm seeing the family or you know just taking a chance to uh watch a movie or watching a TV show before you go to bed\nAnd then you have some times I'm really thinking that you know when you break it down I think that's seven hours for most people is the proper number of hours of sleep and there's a lot of tools that you can use to figure that out they have some apps that can actually um check your sleeping behavior you can go to a sleep study\nUm but you know one of the things that I've found instead of paying a bunch of money\nIs just try to figure out how much sleep do I need to feel good okay and try variations of that time\nSo let's say that eight hours for some people let's say that's too much let's say like you feel groggy okay so\nWhat about seven and a half so groggy okay what about seven how's that ... and just and trial by error and set the alarm and go to bed at a proper time count how much\nTime that is set the alarm and see how you feel and it's all trial by er and nothing is one size fits all when it comes to us and in the human form nothing is one size fits all they were all different we're all wired differently\nTo some degree we have our own personalities or individual things that we love to do the things we hate you know the things that we don't do well at the things that we really excel out all these things very powerful but\nWe can sit there and look at ourselves as being a cookie cutter we've got to realize that this is going to be an individual type thing okay so sleep sleep is the bedrock for everything I think if you're not getting good sleep you don't have clarity of thought\nOkay if you're not getting good sleep you're more testy irritable when you're not getting good sleep your body functions do not work properly okay the functions that need to be done at night when you're sleeping needs time to do it\nAnd if you'd like to do some research into that 'cause I don't want to focus just honestly but I Want to get you curious enough to go on line and do your research to realize\nAll the metabolic stuff that is going on while you're sleeping all this stuff that's happened and that's good for you that you really need to spend more time in the bed sleep and to get the most out of that sleep schedule and you get the most out of that time\nSo that you can rebuild and repair your body because that's when it's happening the time when you're rebuilding or a parent is not when you're walking around all day at work it's when you're at home in bed asleep\nOkay and so if you're cutting corners on that time the repair is also being cut cut in half if not even more and so it's not really even happening you know the next step\nAnd the next way to prioritize your health after sleep is being aware of what you were eating\nI Know I Know harp at a senior year of on him on a soapbox but I'm telling you we are what we eat we are what we see and hear\nRight [noise] yeah\nWe are what we eat we are what we see and hear and this is a big deal\nAnd when we're not eating well and we're not taking care of our body and we're ingesting things that are not good for us we're not showing ourselves that we care were not being tired or ourselves we're not being gentler to ourselves we're actually being mean\nAnd crude and rude\nBecause we're giving our body stuff that we cannot use stuff that gets in the way stuff that clogged arteries stuff that slows us down so that gives his belly ache I mean some of the biggest indications alone are the things you should need is the stuff that makes\nYou hurt if you're hurting feeling bad\nYou know some of your eating stuff that's making you have trouble focusing summer you are you a new stuff that makes you want to sleep immediately to have eat too much heavy food and too much of it all at one time\nSome of your eating and things that your stomach immediately starts hurting gay notes itself probably either allergic or your body is having trouble breaking it down and processing it very important okay things to not overlook\nOccasionally eating stuff that's not great for you okay we're really think about how many occasions is that okay okay because it does mess with your system and ... and it takes several days to go back to the way it was it's not a bad thing it's just something that you want to be aware of\nAnd studies show that people suffering from depression have a smaller hypo campus than others I Know you better watch out if you got a small handful campus I'm telling ya\n[laughter] we're going to compare our hypo campuses after the show he uses bigger and here's a smaller\nSo think about it studies show that people suffering from depression at a smaller rival campus and others are okay\nThat means this is actually physical okay\nAnd I like to put that in perspective for people because I think depression I think people think the president is just like a I don't feel good or a I don't feel happy\nThis is like an actual physical condition\nOkay like going back to the segment one when I was talking about going to the hospital for surgery go into the hospital for a broken leg why don't people take the time to admit themselves in the hospital for mental\nStuff again it's a real physical issue I think about if you have a smaller hype of campus and I do that's physical that's a real thing we can look at Dr on campus and go man yours is way smaller than ... campus and think about that and think about\nThis this will also cook your noodle or your eyeball campus as well as a regular exercise can actually promote the nerve cell growth\nIn that part of the brain okay really regular exercise can promote the growth of the nerves and the nerve cells and which can improve brain function and can improve what going back to move again can improve your mood\nSo if you think about it sleep will improve your mood eating right will improve your mood and exercise so picking the right workout is really important because you want to pick something that you're gonna do you want to pick something that is that you really really want to\nDo you want to pick something that you can do and you want to stick to it and you want to find a friend or accountability partner if you can as well because I don't make sure that you show up to the gym or you show up to the you know to the\nYou know outside of the street where are you all go run or walk around the neighborhood every year to show up because he got someone else depending on you\nKnow that can always be the case because I Know some of us have different schedules I don't have an accountability partner when it comes to work out because nobody has my schedule it seems like and everybody I tried to work out with me get to work out with me as kind of well\nThey haven't followed through which is okay we all have our responsibilities and so if we need to do but you can't sell yourself up to somebody that's not going to show up so\nI Would really take the leadership role in this if you can\nAnd lead yourself to the gym lead yourself to the walking around the block lead yourself to getting stuff done into promoting your health because it's very powerful because remember this is\nThis is real this is physical awful campus that's in your brain and\nHave a small one can dictate depression and you can increase the size if you work out well that to me is a no brainer\nGay no pun intended another thing that you can do that I find very powerful that I suggest to every one of my clients is to really be aware of how much time you're on the phone [noise] how much time\nAre you on your phone how much time you're looking at it that much time are you on it how much time as your head start getting into you even forgotten at the outside world exist\nNow what I found about is when you're on the phone real quick on and off that's great but when you begin to like saddle up to the phone all the\nTime okay\nAnd you begin to spin off ... countless hours on that phone I found very I I find myself in those situations to feel very emotionally drain very emotionally and see\nBecause it's like massive information overload\nI'm also there's a lot of people and there's a lot of people going through a lot of pain and suffering in this world and I feel for everybody but you can you you've gotta you've gotta remember okay if you're emotionally bank or if you don't have anything in the bank you can't keep giving gay\nAnd I know it can be a little overwhelming and I and I love Facebook but it can be a little overwhelming when you see everybody that needs prayers in somebody's hurt and something else I mean it can be overwhelming and and I sent prayers and I do all that stuff and I really do think about that but in the same account of how much are you doing that for you too as well\nVery powerful ... really think about that okay\nReally think about that because it can be information overload and so taking a moment\nWhen I Try to do versus what I Do ah I'll tell you what I Try to do\nI actually try to take off an entire day um at least like five hours on a Sunday from my phone or am I always successful no have I miss the five hours yes\nWell what I challenge you to do is is can you take two hours off from your phone on the weekend two hours just to out not to meet you hours in the same two hours you can be one hour here when I hear\nWhat if you try to do that and start implementing that right now and see what happens\nTo the power of what that I'll grant you into your life the amount of clarity that that can offer in the amount of fulfillment you'll have by not being on social media and all that stuff for two hours of your weekend\nAnd also bonds you with people around you I think you'll have better conversations with your family and I think we'll get more out alive because you'll actually be there instead of on the sidelines of life\nI'm thinking and looking at things through your cell phone to try it out it can be very powerful um and it is actually a very powerful but it takes you to be consistent and to try it and if you just try a few times I think he'll\nHe'll feel good about it stay

percent plugged in not charging\nA and yeah have you tried other chargers and other cables\nNow I have a ... yeah\nSo generally that's what it means I mean there's ... how old is the laptop\nIt's going about ten years [laughter] only when\nYou said windows tan I'm thinking I Can't be that old ten years okay so there's two possibilities are the cheap one is that the cable or the chargers is worn out but after ten years this sounds like it might be the batteries worn out\nLittle lithium ion batteries which is what powers are phones and our laptops in our cameras and everything these days it empowers my Tesla\nLithium ion batteries are great but they have one little flaw they are only they only work for a certain number of power cycles a power cycle is fully charged fully discharged actually it's the other way around fully discharged and then fully charge that's one cycle and most lithium\nIon batteries have maybe about five hundred full cycles that they can do\nAnd after a certain amount of time or they just won't take a charge anymore\nAnd so that could be the source of the not charging as well so there are windows um there are programs you can run that will look into your battery and tell you\nI'm a what the batteries doing actually windows ten even has this built in I don't know if it would be enough information for you to figure out if your batteries broken but

aren't in the office of coordinator has brought this triple auction off its in here and they've been pretty successful with it the sheer number three nationally and rushing off ants number one in the Gulf now conference in rushing\nTheir averaging just a hair over thirty points per game and so ... they've been really strong defensively is really where Mississippi College has kind of locked in a little bit of giving up a lot of points this year uh and so you ... you have to take advantage of that today\nWhere Mississippi College just scored at least Twenty one points in every game may have played this season and they put up over thirty points in three outings and Brian mentioned they average just a hair over thirty points per game to go with that option often but they've thrown just fifty five passes in five games project is\nOption often but they've thrown just fifty five passes in five games projected starting quarterback ... he is questionable but don't sleep on his ability to throw the football\nThat's exactly the right he can throw the football I mean he he really hasn't done a lot of it this year but let's take a look at his high school numbers into seasons in high school football he passed for over Seventy five hundred yards and eighty seven touchdown folks that didn't two seasons\nOf high school football so don't sleep like you said on the fact that ... can throw the football so far this year just four hundred and fifty yards through the air three touchdowns three interception forty four percent completion right but if he has to move the football field through the air he's definitely got the ability to do and\nHe has a stable of running backs that he will work with today led by type various lamp Kim\nMake sure we we do a good job of of running to the football you know tackling it you know it's kind of an old school\nA fundamentalist type type game so you know it's been a good way of ... of practice in preparation I'm just you know excited and anxious to see 'em to not\nWhat sort of work have you been able to get from the ... team preparing for this and it has to be a challenge just for them to be able to running off it's like this yeah you\nKnow a lot a lot of walk through a graduate assistance have been a great job with them just kind of walking through the different you know plays in steps and blocks that that that these type often says do uh we we've moved dimitrius Kirk ... who's one of our corners and bending over on the scouting up off and so we kind of moved him back to quarterback some this week\nUh he played it a little bit of Cordova last season so\nI'm you know we do the best with what what we can you know we we understand that you know\nThere is nothing can can match the speed we're about to see tonight so we've had a good job of kind of just going over our assignments and um you know once we get out there tonight and the speed gets on us and and we kind of get a handle of that you know I look for us to settle down and play well\nChris Johnson and kj Smith I feel like all season they've done a great job of supporting the run up against the triple option in an office aren't just forty five\nPasses how do they attack the option from the back end well\nThey've got to do a great job with their eyes you know we're gonna play uh coverage where they're going to be moving in flowing with with the motion and um you know they've they've got to do a good job no one you know whether I start where they transferred to on whatever motion that is so um\nYou know it's it's gonna be obviously a different type of game for them but\nUm you know we're excited to see them we're going to need all the tackles we can get you know so those guys you know or need need to really have a good game\nAnd put the players in the box from the defense of line to the line backers I mean we've seen some that come from the defense of on and you obviously have a lot of debt that linebacker but ... today\nWell you know I mean we're going you know we're going to have to roll them in\nIn and out regularly you know what I mean you know especially um the sideline to sideline you know the motions are the options that policies you know they they get you run in you know laterally as as as well as vertically so um you know our guys you know we're\nA good thing we've created a little bit of depth we're going to probably have to roll more ... more line backers than than we typically do so um you know it's going to be very much a team effort or you know that's why it's it's it's the greatest\nGame there is detained game so you know everybody knows they've they've got their roles to play and um I look forward to seeing them you know play their responsibilities to not to the best of their ability\nGo gamble they give you

some coming out of alumni back in town today should be a great game against Mississippi College time to talk now with you in a office of coordinator Ryan apple in and\nCourage avalanche just start off I'm asking everybody this last week a point of emphasis from the coaches to the players the challenge was to get in on your own time watch more film study prepare more do you feel like you saw great effort from your guys from the additional film studying\nOr did you know the guys at a good job of coming up and I'm really making it a priority you know and I think it's\nA lot of times we we forget in in you know outside looking in you forget about the school work and it is tough you know to juggle that and\nYou know being a student athlete and trying to manage that time and get over and grab lunch before you get to meetings and so on but the guys at a phenomenal job last week of coming in and you know our big challenge offensively was was bringing a teammate don't just come by yourself bring somebody with you and\nUm those guys that are really good job of of of doing that and you know you can tell that showed on Saturday\nFirst driver the game you guys go down in score third time this season the office has been able to do that how good was that to see it was good\nYou know guys that are really good job you know ... executing the game plan and um you know I think it always it's always a a good start or when you can go down and put points up and move the ball they had the chains and I'm really kind of try and set the tone for the game but you know it was very proud of the guys and um they're really good job started off right\nChristian Lopez those were two hundred sixty one yard she completed eighty percent of his passes into the additional film work really paid difference for him as well\nYeah I think as a as a whole you know when you do that and you get a chance to come in here and sit down and listen or go downstairs and watch yourself do it um you pick up on things you don't see when you're in a rush or you know you're just in a film study with your coach because you get really a lot of time to sit down and rewind it as much as you want so\nI think it helped them I think it you know he was prepared\nNot that's not saying he hasn't been all year but you can tell that he felt comfortable what we were doing and then there's a big difference\n... running back the senior another Ninety yard rushing performances three straight ball games I mean what's been the difference for him during the stretch\nI think he's just on a really good job of of understanding um schemes up front you know it's a gap schemer zones game but just knowing his landmark where he's supposed to press um how he's supposed to set up his blockers and religious attribute to him and\nUm his ability to come in again and watch tape and understand how people play it you know where they fit and when the\nYou know the knows he goes back side of a up and so you see him doing a good job of understanding you know what land or trying to hit and seeing his guys work and religious\nPresidents landmarks and aligned doing a phenomenal job get into the second level get into those backers um it's just a it's a group effort of those guys pressing a landmark you know making those backers fit and is allowing us are are aligned to second level but there were some holds the other night where I think it shocked and how big day or so he um I Know he enjoyed that\nOne more player I Want to hit on a guy that we don't talk about very much Blake bean and the fourth quarter has a humongous third down catch I Believe it was his first career catch but he's the guy is a lot of dirty weren't ... was it seeing him come up with the big\nBoy it was awesome you know I think being that one guy that never complains never says anything and\nUm that that's what's being done this years he just he does his job you know and obviously there's times where we can fix certain things worse technique and stuff like that but it's been different forum I'm doing all that stuff with his hands around but he's been our dirty war guy he does a heck of a job in\nUm haven't really had a chance to connect with him he's at a couple of times he's he's been open or create some separation on route but\nFor him to come through late in the game on a third down or was huge and um you know he he was super excited when he got back to sideline you should've seen I mean all the guys were fired up for 'em\nI let's turn to page Mississippi College today's opponent a breakdown this defense force what do they look like\nThey're active um you know they're they fly around and do a good job they they give you a bunch of different looks and um this is gonna be\nSomething we've got to do a great job of early of identifying what they're doing you know I think each week um they'll get into some different stuff a lot of times are going to base out of what they do um they play fast of a play physical other backing guys fly around and they will hit you and so we've got to do a great job of ball security early\nAre you looking for the ultimate you an experience and make sure you stopped by the

except for the homecoming game north Alabama hosting Mississippi College you're Raleigh municipal stadium it's time now to talk with you and they head football coach Chris oil is as we get set for this homecoming game and coach Willis\nLet's just start off with the west Florida game from last week a you know you've always said you want your team to have a shot at winning the game and the fourth quarter and\nWe're actually down to scores in the fourth quarter played our way back into it and it was a tough loss but what about the way the team to get back into that game\nI mean we we've done that all year ah this is a team that comes to work every day for practice and meetings and in weight room and uh you know the every game I Know that we're going to give our best and we're going by and we're going to be there and\nUh but now sometimes when you do that you may give great effort but you don't get the results you will and some of the results right now in the past two weeks just been\nBeen a lot of mistakes a will for miss cues from you know just you know didn't execute the play or or gave up a big play on on the side of the ball and then the penalties of hurt us you know now that I've gone back and we've really focused on to hold the football games because that seems to be where all the penalties are common I think we've\nSomething like at home or have gotten sixteen Fifteen your penalties caught on us on the road and four games have only had like five or six something like that and so\nIf and when I go back and evaluate amount of Thirteen penalties or I just don't think they were all you know six penalties could have been no calls and I'm officiating it at home it's been rough and so\nUh you know but some of that is on us and we we worked at it we've corrected it we've made a point to get that fix so we just got to clean up some things you know once again Campbell was a really good football team and and\nYou go to them and you can't have those mistakes most of those mistakes were I'm On the field wasn't as much penalties it was just bad snaps busted coverage stuff like that\nA guess West Florida the effort was there that was a really good fault football game in the end though they made a few more plays I mean just overall came away with we missed three interceptions we should've come away with and uh\nYou know they would have been different than the game and then you know they just touched down in the back in the end zone they did not get in and we didn't have instant replay that was a big touchdown score a we've been like you know like to help them to feel go\nUp at the end of the day you know once again they were some crucial Dr killers you know moving down on a sec\nOr maybe are holding golf all star and we've got to be able to finish the drugs you got to be able to score points and hopefully we'll you know we usually do we just keep working with ... and when she you know go into the meeting rooms and trying to find ways to get better we got a lot of youth on this team and a lot of guys still learning and uh\nIt's going to take a couple of games or to throughout the season next season to kind of get what we want I mean it is just as part of the growing pains one\nOf the points of emphasis last week coach that you challenged your team with was putting in the extra time in the film ... own their own time studying preparing for the game and you feel like that extra time showed on Saturday\nIt did ah you could tell quarterback seemed a lot more calm Mitt and um you know the him and the receivers had a good connection going yeah I Do I think it's it's good you know we\nThe if they already watched family can now days away they get this thing set up as you can watch them at your own home what on your own phone or laptop computer or whatever it may be um but I just like it when they're able to come over here it's kind of like the world we live in now you know everybody wants to take some message you know what it wants to call anybody anymore nobody\nDoes in face meetings anymore and so I just seem to go back to the ways I remember\nWe used to do it when I was coordinating and stuff it just I like I'm coming into buildings coming over here sitting in on meetings it makes me feel like that you know they're locked and they're trying to learn the game plan you know if you don't just see 'em until position means in practice sometimes you you feel like you lose touch with them a little bit\nThree and three on this season we've been going nonstop since week one two more games until the by week I mean how's the team holding up mentally just with this grueling stretch\nWell I can tell it's dropped off I'm a ... weeks a challenge trying to motivate and uh we try to take each game and and find something different to motivate with\nAnd no it's not as easy as you would think especially when you know you're not playing for post season so\nIt's been a challenge um you know we could use the ball we probably already uh we are banged up difference when this year last year were banged up to where we don't have the guys is actually out you know a season ending injuries and stuff like that we're just we're just really beat up in\nA more so probably mentally they're just partied a tad bit but\nYou know as soon as part of it sometimes is the way the schedule fall and you got a ground through it and um we've got two days left before you get the break and we'd like to finish that will too when we're having our pre game\nTalk with you and I head football coach Chris Willis miss

got another game and I don't want to be here today it's not like that\nOr the attitudes are great and you know some days of practice a little bit better than others you you're not going to be is up for practices your for a game on Saturday [noise] the thing we're looking for right now just staying focused on what to do your responsibilities and hopefully in in process that you're given a great effort if not we ... we had to step in and\nYou know kind of push 'em a little bit too usually sometimes a little bit rubber live on a Wednesday and so on and as a week goes it gets better but a ...\nA little bit rubber that on a Wednesday and so on and as a week goes it gets better but a ... have been fine and we we have no no the the energy levels there and you know nowadays you play music

red shirt rules freshman complain up to four games to some of the freshmen who maybe have not played to this point how do you approach the next four games with them\nWell you know that's that's one of those things will yeah you'd like to play 'em but you got to be in the right situation I mean we are named when those are where we need to win a football game and\nThis is options football this is not necessarily the game to insert freshmen in you know just where we looked at it uh the last ... last two home games for sure we are going to dress caught a few freshmen and if it presents itself what we'll put them out there you know\nBut you know you're talking about freshman hadn't really been playing and you know even though you might try to keep them around the game playing a little bit they've been going bad given ... teams so\nUh they've kind of been disengaged a little bit on the on the play book and so you just got to pick and choose who they're going in with and we won't do 'em
