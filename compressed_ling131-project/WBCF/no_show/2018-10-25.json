vote for the person not the party\nWell I I agree with you it it shouldn't just be party line but like it or not generally speaking if you're a conservative the Republican generally speaking will be a more aligned with political you know issues if you're if you're a liberal the Democrat will be generally speaking more aligned with you on issues of topics that are important to you but you know with you\nKnow you look like ... who it was a it was a Democrat if I Lived in bear county I Would have voted for him and I'm a conservative but I also know that he's a conservative but he was a blue dog

become a drag queen I'm telling them to have the conversations because it will come up in life\nThis wide rolled around um let me think about that you know it's a it's a good it's a lower might be under something uh-huh let me let me throw this out there when I was fourteen I said mom\nThinking about being a drag queens [laughter]\n[laughter] you direct to be who I can talk about to get the idiosyncrasies down as to what that takes it thinking about him and myself Joey low horror and my mom was like I I support you I'm tolerant ...\nAnd you didn't have that conversation no of course polo

and everything and they in turn around and show them how to dance and it turned around and said shake it shake your pets like fair and I'm sitting here going and the taste it can stay with teachers out there with kids and they were kept laugh and I thought\nWhat the heck is going on in our\n... and then the response from the administrators of the teachers is oh well if you don't want us to do stuff like that let us know next time caffeine it's nuts it's crazy it's outlandish to disconnect from politics for a moment we're going to have a great conversation with a ... a competitor oh you might win\n[noise] well um with ah some coaches I mean I can only speak\nDirectly about Blake is very he's he's engaging the hands off when it comes to creativity or a ... he knows well especially with me he knows that I'm grown ass man I'm going to do it I'm going to do and he's he doesn't try to get too much in them in the way\nAt when I have a direction I'm kind of bull headed to like him stubborn out at a sea all want to form can you let them fly whereas like Adam\nAre you know I've got some friends that aren't team at him and he is really in the trenches with a plan and like guitar he he's sharp a range the song sit you know so every coaches different styles and an approach is with me like it's pretty hands off\n... and ... again it's a day Finley ... first name last name Finley ... go follow me ... all the social media and vote for him on a on the boys when when it comes time for the live shows hopefully are you going to be in a life just as this maybe you're on the live shows now that you made it to the battle rounds\nNo there's another round called the knockout round that because I think it goes that like every team starts at twelve I think he goes to like well that's forty eight people total right I think he is forty eight thirty six twenty four twelve okay ten eight for one so I think voting starts at twenty four\nAnd when it comes to the song selection is vitally important and and sometimes I mean I I I think that you actually did this the other day you're like okay so what's the process here [noise] um ... what is the thought process do you have him put them on the song choice this lake say I had this election I chose this song and you're going to do it how does that work\nWith that but I you know unveiling too much behind the curtain at every most things are collaborative okay like the battleground the battleground has completely the coaches discretionary choice so we had a zero input is Blake was ...\n\nHe picks for reasons and uh and he's proud of it and I thought it was I thought it was a very interesting choice and probably not that I ever would have thought to sing but it gave me the chance to do the low notes and it gave me a chance to do it was very close range eater gave me a lot of it gave me a shot\nBut what's interesting about a day because I again correct me if I'm wrong but I think you actually say what were you thinking on this one [laughter]\nI didn't want to sound offensive but I mean 'cause I mean case is not a country guy at All right how do you keep ... so my opponent\nMy friend and uh and now you got stolen by the amount of which is amazing right yeah but yeah he wasn't country at all so I was very confused about the ... by the thought process I was like man as he\nTotally just trying to put on the softball here yeah and if and screw over Keith ... is way right turn that turns out the keys was the one who had a loan out in his audition is blind audition rice has I think Blake actually thought this\nWould suit keep better because of the loan outs and then we just had to flip it and make it really cool current feeling song\nIt's interesting that each day family from San Antonio by way of Nashville he's on the voice on NBC Monday Tuesday is invention probably Wednesdays when the knockout rounds and with a live show started happening you mentioned keep Lulu so your competitor you said that he's your friend\nAnd you know ... that's the guy standing in the way so it's for me you know I've got friends that are talk show host so I don't I don't hate other people who do what I Do but at the same time I want better ratings than them you guys really do make personal relationships\nYou know it's so funny you ask because when I Would watch the show I'm a fan of the show anyway yeah I watch it before and I see somebody get eliminated as the the other person one get sad and then I'll be like what the hell [laughter]\nDoesn't make any sense but when you get out to LA in your building these bonds that people you know there's a lot of time spent and indeed the personalities and we're all working towards the same goals same path and we're going to lean on each other after the show's over because there's only one winter I mean everybody else is going to have to lose you know so\nThe fact that we've become this kind of really great friendship community he only lives a couple of hours away so we we talk almost every day I mean we're we're just a great friends and I've done that with lots of of the other people on the show\nThough that's really cool it's day friendly he's doing great on the voice on NBC so I mean obviously you want to win but there's also a byproduct of you're getting all this incredible publicity publicity you couldn't buy\nA and and you know people are seeing new to the tune of as you said millions and millions of people watch the show they loved that show they're tweeting about it are you getting recognized out there have you heard from anybody else in the industry saying hey I think you have something win or lose let's talk W how's that going\nYou know that it's getting exciting you know to to say the least you know there has been some recognition here and there there has been more sold out shows that I've never done before ... am starting to make you know certainly ways ... not to notice that ah I mean is that I'm On the Joe ... show\nRight now [laughter] yeah that's that's huge that that's the highlight of the week certainly [laughter] I have I've got to ask you um\nWhen it comes to to what you're working on what you're

S. twenty of the twentieth century good evening to you wreck\nGood evening John indeed China does have intermediate range ballistic missiles and two thousand fourteen it revealed its dong facing the F twenty six a four thousand kilometer range\nOr intermediate range ballistic missile comparable\nTo the old Soviet ss twenty I R B um that was the subject and was destroyed because of the INS treaty\nChina does have this missile in both are armed with nuclear warheads and with the new verbal anti ship ballistic missile warheads Gordon\nRick there are a couple of problems with the IMF treaty right now I'm principal among them is that the Russians have been violating it since at least two thousand eight and the United states despite what has been doing has not been able to bring the Russians into compliance\nThat would seem to me to be a good reason to get out of the treaty\nBecause we just have a one sided agreement right now but the other reason is what you've just been talking about and that the Chinese are not part of the treaty the question is do you think it's possible that Beijing could be persuaded to join a new uh ins treaty which should include Russia and the United states\nGordon uh it's my opinion the both the Russians and the Americans at various times have tried have implored the Chinese to consider some kind of relationship with the IMF treaty the problem with China\nUh since we started a outreach since really since the Nineteen eighties when we began to try to have these conversations with the Chinese is is is that they have refused entirely\nTo be constrained in any way by an international arms control treaty or they their\nTheir goal is dominance and if your goal is to dominate well then you conceal you hide you refuse any kind of transparency so that your enemy or can prepare to defend themselves against the Chinese understand this and so they reject arms control as we have practice it even with\nOur dire enemy the former Soviet Union\nOr just Russia have a dialogue with China about\nIntermediate range missiles they the same concern could be ...\nImagine Russia had with Europe Russia could have with China there is no warning here\nJohn it's my opinion it based on conversations that\nThere is a wide swath of the Russian national security elite that has long been concerned with China's military buildup especially their build up a ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles unfortunately for them however ... has decided that he\nNeeds China's economic support in order for his regime has dictatorship to survive\nSo he is going to downplay and ignore the strategic challenge from China for now but\nI also believe that ... ... and his national security advisers understand that after this period of on talks with China that the Chinese are going to come after them and so they ... they're buying time to prepare for an eventual Chinese tilt against the Russians Gordon\nSo Rick with these short and intermediate range missiles or the Chinese have them all of them are appear to be mobile even the ones that are supposedly hidden underground\nThe U.S doesn't have road mobile a ballistic missiles we've got ones that are in silos they're really vulnerable because they can be taken out on a first strike\nUm do you think that the United states will actually go to what the Russians and the Chinese have which are these but a ballistic missiles sitting on big trucks that can just go wherever they want or are we going to stay with a silos in the future\nOf Gordon the army has a program to build a modern short range ballistic missiles and there have been suggestions from army officials that they would like medium range ballistic missiles as well\nAs the Chinese have been building medium range ballistic missile solid fuel mobile medium range ballistic missiles ah since the early Nineteen nineties\nUh the twenty seconds right the American military wants them as well and as we do build them and we should we should also consider offering the technology to our allies in Asia\nRed fish are the international assessment of the strategy center the INS treaty at this point\nIn six months Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John bachelor\n\nVowing to sign the culprit I'm Lisa ...

P. H. D. the divides all economies into their consumption their investment and sort of China has been inflated the largest investment bubble ever created in history\nAnd then on top of which there's a lot of leverage nobody really knows how much that there is on the Chinese economy when you cut through it and the demand inside the country hasn't gotten to the ... worth of support all this debt so I think there's only one painful way through this and that is that the structure\nGordon Charles or you know number of countries have tried to manage their way out of crises tried to outgrow um problems and in China certainly falls into that category\nAnd it seems as the article that John referred to in the beginning of the segment essentially um you don't have very much upside potential for China really what it is is at best\nA straight line flat line gross ... ... it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nWell I I don't think that China really has the long a period of experimentation in history that we have in the west they just haven't lived through the many booms and busts and we can trace our modern economy back to the mid Eighteen hundreds we've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of the\nThere's just too much productive capacity in China that they can sell their products and services\nAnd dumped them around the world and places like the U.S where that's not going to happen anymore so\nThere's a simple way through this you have to cut your fascinates you have to encourage people consume more pleasure country and you gotta you gotta be forthcoming with how much that you're truly happen if it's too much just go to the guy to be marked downs and then I have to be a redo of a Chinese financial structure\nA garden are reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't\nA garden are reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't look as bad as everything else does that make sense or they are they selling domestically\nBut I don't think they are John Doe their numbers tell you that they are so for instance they're saying the official national ... retail sales increased nine point two percent in September\nAnd the same month a sales of automobiles so Levin point six percent\nUm vehicle sales were down the three months of ball three months of the quarter and yet they're saying that the consumption has increased that just doesn't make sense John especially when you start looking at the sale of other items which were also slapped or down\nSo I think that China has a real data problem in terms of what they're reporting to people but I think it got to do that in a sense because if people really knew the truth there would be panic if there'll be panic it would be the end of the economy so what they're doing is they're just trying to lie and basically get their way through a very difficult patch\nI don't think they can do at this time um and then we'll just have to see\nAll right they're buying the Brooklyn Bridge every thirty five minutes a Charles ah what what is what's in it for us does this indication of failure I mean it's a it's a big two thousand eighty or we're looking at does this come our way we got defenses for their equity collapse\nWell I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing if the German Jay Powell to the Federal Reserve has managed to get interest rates up above three percent of the ten year which means that in awe of China collapsed or China\nDowndraft we have room to lower interest rates and cushion the blow compared to other economies I think we're all in much better position than any other large economy\nIt'll hurt is trying to go through this painful process economically I fear that sort of distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the population that metric poses an order\nIs certainly a very dangerous set of months here um but in the end I think the United states even if the Republicans do not maintain control that ... will survive the coming retrenchment far better than any other major country\nAnd and Gordon I'm checking with you because of this question before is the Chinese Communist party capable of taking a recession because that cures this there they they they they've missed price their economy can they take a hit\nI think that they believe that they can't and that's the reason why they have been fighting the economy with too much cash you know as you talked about just a few seconds ago China did not go through it's two thousand that everybody else did\nAnd eventually they got to go through that I'm right now we're in a pretty good position because as Charles points out our interest rates have gone up we have moved to move them down again and we're very icing robust career and so um you know with a ton of goes up or down and you know we'll be able to get through this and we'll do very well\nEarlier today Charles Gordon and I were corresponding and there was a report in the Financial Times that businesses have borrowed up to one hundred percent against their stock\nOr that they they borrowed it they give it to the bank and they borrow against it but the stock market

rates the of course referring to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell the president said it almost looks like he's happy\nRaising interest rates and it tell us a little bit more about the relationship between the president of the United states and the chairman of the Federal Reserve is the former chairman of the securities and Exchange Commission\nAnd a Bloomberg LP board member Arthur eleven Arthur when you heard these comments coming out of the interview with President Donald Trump what was your first thought\nI thought back to the period of time when Paul Volcker was facing\nA rose creating double digit interest rates to curb the pressures of the markets at that time\nAnd he took a terrible beating a I publicly commended him for having\nThe courage to withstand the pressure of President Reagan in the summer of eighty four when chief of staff Jim Baker told Volcker that he was being order not to raise rates before the election\nSo a ... day Volcker would prefer that the fed has stuck with the verbal description of price stability that Alan Greenspan required that no that was\nThe state in which you expected changes in the general price level goat effectively alter business or household decisions\nSo the arch inflation fighter as misgivings about the feds to mandate to achieve both full employment and stable prices are and I think he feels very strongly about growth being the most important contributor ah\nI think if you worry too much about growth at the expense of inflation you are in big trouble\nBut having said that Arthur ... is it at all\nAs surprising as some have described that the president would have a public comment about the Federal Reserve or the chairman of the Federal Reserve because we've seen this before with with Arthur Burns as you've just described Paul Volcker this is not\nSomething out of the ordinary or is it because it had become so public and we kind of live in a reality television program well\nI think that's part of it I think while all of a President Trump's predecessors have had their dues with a fad none of them are prepared to go to the extremes that President Trump is going to I don't think any of them had\nMass rallies and which they would condemn the chairman of the fed which I think is exactly what a you know Trump is prepared to do I think the states have escalated enormously uh since the days of of Paul Volcker\nI Love it we had an extraordinary conversation with Gordon Johnson a vertical research this morning news cautious on Tesla and critical of their accounting he used a word from a gentleman you know from decades ago Howard show it calling it accounting shenanigans\nYou lead the charge on this of what you can do particularly within the manufacturing process not a good will embed will but what you can do with the cash conversion cycle with revenue recognition and such are we often\nBut the cash conversion cycle with revenue recognition and such are we auditing any better than we were in the time of member ex driving bricks around Los Angeles are we doing any better and counting the beans at our companies\nI think we're doing somewhat better in terms of uh I Do think that some of ah\nDodd Frank's hum mission and I think that some of the FAFB mandates have improved us but I think there have developed at the same time in the business community\nMore devices that will receive investors and the accounting firms have their clients interests um more heart than they do investors interest and that's something that uh we can't get rid of\nArt or do you think it makes any sense to contain the reporting with just one earnings per share number rather than the variety that then sends analysts and investors running to figure out what is it just it it got adjusted every quarter\nYes I certainly do a book that's going to be a very hard bridge to cross but I think clearly and we'd be better off with a single number\nI mean it's like the confusion of the New York football giants I mean there's many different\nInterpret what what's the confusion there of who should who they should on low that oh I see okay it's a team and transition you know ... that comes out as well ... of the Los Angeles Dodgers Arthur ... thank you so much greatly appreciated the former chairman of the FCC and of course\nAnd now it gets easier [laughter] ah yeah\nTo that point um you know it's interesting it may be for instance best team in the last twenty five years and then this is definitely a darn much best football team in the last twenty five years on buddy ... and his staff has done an outstanding job with the program and\nYou know right now um we go from strain on the number one off the team in the country to number one defensive team in the country they got three three hundred pound kids who are extremely athlete athletic up front it looked like it as a team\nOr nobody's really even move the ball on them and will be another challenge of a very different dimension to

for our\nCoach when you take on dark missing one thirty on Saturday how do you deal with the\nDefense that practices by tackling robots\n[laughter] well I I think coach Stevens and his staff and done a great job that you know the entire league um there's not too many and she's in tackling and we've been doing that forever you know we could be ah to the NFL model probably Twenty years ago we just felt that\nThe bottom line is you got to get your best horses to the starting gate on Saturday or friday and get them they're healthy and uh I I think everybody in our league does a great job of that and part of it is that's a new one with the coaches themselves adopted a couple of years ago but uh yeah they've got a lot on the robot's going around there and they they are doing a good job of shock

newsletter tables and a lot going on today because of earnings where do you want to begin\nYou know I mean pick on mood sat kind of a day you know I I Will point out though there are there are certainly a few companies that\nAre kind of front and center when it comes to the reaction to that resolves I'd say Microsoft is in that category up more than six percent a late yesterday there fiscal first quarter figures ... and revenue beating analysts average estimates of Bloomberg survey it's all about cloud computing at Microsoft\nInternet based services are benefitting them and it was a shift in their business over the last few years under a CEO such an adult\nThen you have Twitter desperate for money as a as a five hundred at the moment up twenty percent in the wake of their results and indeed the advertisers are spending more on Twitter especially as the service moves to clean up some of the steak and uh\nYou know questionable accounts out there so you have that going on then you throw in Tesla update and a half percent after their results now it's really accomplish specific story you\nKnow it's all about profit that people weren't expecting cash flow of being positive for the first time in two years but it's not just has like either boards up almost eight percent ... their results I mean even though uh they had put out some financial targets for twenty twenty said they're not going to be able to reach him nonetheless\nPeople like their third quarter number so you can find enough of those examples\nOr to really come lead to a rebound in stocks here at least for the moment\nEspecially led by the NASDAQ because of some of those ... that you're talking about rabbits NASDAQ up nearly two point four percent I'm certainly not understand though what we're learning about what the jitters that we've seen this week were caused by a man yesterday\nUh we can't gloss over the fact that we saw some of the biggest declines in the October is poised for the worst performance since February two thousand nine for certain us equity indices what's behind that says it's just a re pricing is there something deeper here\nWell I mean when you say ... pricing the question becomes what do we pray for\nYou know and arguably you look ahead it's not secret that people are looking for early Scruggs to slow down I mean given that the\nEffects of last year as the corporate tax cuts on the federal level are are going to play out over the next quarter to and then it's back to whatever passes for normal and normal isn't quite the same as it was a few years ago considering you know the cost increases the companies are facing when it comes to\nLabor or shipping or raw materials or you know what's going on with the dollar a kind of coming into play you rise in value and that becomes an issue trade tariffs interest rates so I mean there's a lot of\nThere's a laundry list of of there is but I just I guess if you dig into specific stocks whether it's utilities and the fact that they have outperformed during this or whether we're seeing you know there is there anything that we can glean from sort of where we've seen uh the biggest moves\nYou know to this point it it's a hard one to get around but I Will tell you like the industrial companies kind of jump out if only because you know you think about that laundry list you know it's probably like staring them into face point by point pretty much and so\nYou know the idea that we've seen disappointments there you know kind of get your attention though I Will say you know you look at today international paper being up more than eight percent of the kind of runs counter to that narrative so it's an interesting sort of side point in terms of today's results\nThey said also point out that it is not necessarily a smart move to figure out the detail of why the general market moves in one way or another because there were so many inputs that you just described\nThat you can say all the market did this because of X Y and Z because it's not as if for example the treasury market has been reacting a little bit of a sell off at the long run\nThree point three four percent that's not a big change day over day and yet\nWhen we see a move that confirms something we kind of say oh that's why it happened but it's not necessarily\nI I think though and and I agree with you that to try to give a narrative to something that doesn't easily fit line is disingenuous that said I think it's important just sort of tease out are we learning anything from them moved from the stocks that are getting penalized more from people's knee jerk reactions from\nThe retail investor and whether they're selling yet I mean some of these bigger questions\nAre sort of instructive over a longer period of time for a ... if you\nWere being reminded for sure that October is a volatile months and that doesn't sound like ... style\nHalo and it is right the S. and P. five hundred you know has been down like fourteen days this month all ready ha ha and you know to go and find a bigger total in any month\nYou have to go back ten years and what was going on ten years ago wasn't it pretty time I will say no it was not October two thousand eight in the midst of the financial crisis so if it feels like ... to go October is a spoof\nHe month is the most volatile months out from that whether you look at the ... or you look at just the a percentage of moves in the S P five hundred I mean there are any number of indicators that tell you you get this sort of jumped the reaction and you're really seen that play out today which is not a surprise because it is the busiest day\nOf third quarter earnings season for the U.S and the five hundred today I mean by the time ah you know you get past the closing bell and\nTo the end of the trading or you're going to have more than seven to companies reporting potentially these\nThe editor columnist blogger and spooky October mind trader thank you so much for

wow exciting\nRight now let's go to our Ninety nine one newsroom\nFor world a national headlines snake\nI pay him back to Robert De Niro former vice president Joe Biden there the latest targets of an apparent wave of mail bombs address to a prominent critics of President Trump's New York police removed a suspicious package from De Niro Tribeca restaurant early this morning there are multiple reports two packages were dressed abiding in Delaware\nAnd a you know they're having a little bit of difficulty right now [noise]\nMaking that rape break they've had some airplanes that they can't get all the parts they took to build them to complete than they've had to park them on ramps and such as it was a bit of inefficiency in the quarter\nI expect that that will be cleaned up by year end and so I was ... expect a little bit of lump peanuts and their deliveries which will affect revenues in cash flow as a break given to the fifty seven rate but all of this stuff is positive for long term profitability at Boeing and cash flow as they increase the uh\nThe production of the seven thirty seven which are they're most profitable highest cash flowing a product\nYou know one thing that's interesting about billings earnings is that we're getting a glimpse into their business strategy in particular how they're winning business with the U.S military can you talk a little bit about bad and what it means going forward I mean they basically under price sometimes they're good in order to win and defense that contract right\nYeah they're really taking the long you know to the long view there I think it's pretty impressive [laughter] you know since I've been covering going for a number of years back in the day they used to be a very much fifty percent defense fifty percent commercial\nEnterprise and that's gotten this far I'm skewed to know about sixty five percent what's called roughly commercial thirty five um defense and so we thought a very interesting that they had been quite cheaply for fixed price contracts on\nOn a new trainer aircraft a on a new tanker program for the navy and then we know they've taken losses in the air force tanker [noise]\nYou know the current version of tankers and trainers and such\nHad been flying for fifty plus years about\nTurning bowling is looking at that business and saying we may lose money up front as we build these products\nBut we're going to have fifty years of sustained men on these programs and that's worth a lot of money and it positions you well for the next version when uh when they build it but again I think the next version is probably fifty years out so I think they're looking at a lot of that statement and really taking the long view here\nTell us a little bit about the competition with Airbus right now\nAnd the effect that any problems or concerns over engine malfunctions having on the use of the more efficient jets that Boeing and Airbus produce\nYeah so you know both Boeing and Airbus are making the move right now to\nGo to sort of four hundred percent production of the latest most fuel efficient engines for Boeing that said the G ... leap at for Airbus that's both elite and the United technologies character of a fan\nYou had a lot more problems getting that geared turbo fan stabilized\nAnd delivered to the air frame rusted they can make their deliveries to customers so it's really been hurting Airbus his ability to deliver airplanes out here but I think they're going to recover that by the end of the year [noise]\nNon bowling side they're they've been a bit I'm luckier and this and that the G ... leaders had a little bit of problem\nBut not near the challenges that they the UT ... so that's actually helping them here get ramped up and go to this higher rate and and realize that you know that sort of profit um cash flow ah benefits sooner I'll look you know ... and ... programs are long lived\nA kind of programs and they can\nYou can see problems materialize it later in the program but right now it looks like the the leap is is more stable out of it out of the gate\nGeorge just taking a step back Boeing is the company that gets penalized most when people start getting worried about a trade war with China that is one of the biggest markets of potential expansion for the company\nDid that factor in at all to these earnings they give any insight and how that could affect their profitability going forward\nOn this show I I didn't hear any any concrete insight and how to how it could affect their earnings they\nDo talk on every call about how they're you know a global company\nThey do talk on every call about how they're you know a global company and they're talking the governments and so what I hear to all of this is that I'm trying to assure the marketplace that they are at least involved in the discussions about probably ... or us trade policy goes\nAnd when we've looked at this you know the the um [noise] the situation here is that the backlog for the seven thirty seven which again is the most important program at Boeing I sold a lot of airplanes in China\nSeven years or six years along right now and so you could even have an interruption here for a little bit\nAnd an interruption in um in order yeah but I went out to trade issues right yeah and it wouldn't affect deliveries and the Chinese do is put their owners in the

that the death of Saudi writer drunk a shaggy will not go without an American response he highlighted the disparity in reports from the Saudi and Turkish governments\nThat word from President air to won this morning that this this brutal murderer was premeditated pre planned days in advance flies in the face of earlier assertions that have been made by the Saudi regime and again it underscores the termination of our ministry to find out what happened here\n[noise] but now the Saudis are embracing the Turks version of ... killing after a joint Saudi Turkish team announced that its investigation found the suspects in his death had planned his killing\nFor more on this story we're joined now by bill ferries Bloomberg News national security team leader he's an art Bloomberg Ninety nine months studios in Washington and bill why the turnaround\nBy the Saudis on what happened to your show\nWell I think ultimately the Turks you know know what they're talking about or have evidence to back up what they're talking about their scenarios are are increasingly more credible than anything we've heard out of out of Saudi Arabia\nAnd you know this is now the third I think the third version of the Saudi story that's come out at first a and actually in an interview with us the crown prince uh told Bloomberg ... walked out of the consulate on his own later that day\nAh and then it it became a a you know an interrogation that when a rye and now what we're hearing as the Saudi saying well you know it may have been there there are ... there seems to be evidence that this was premeditated\nKilling 'em so the story of shifted and the Turks have all along said that they think\nAh that you know an assassination team was flown in to do this\nI'm reminded of a Donald Rumsfeld comment about to have the the the\nUnknowns and unknown unknowns of we do have a the Central Intelligence agency director Gina Haspel preparing to brief the president she has been overseas looking at some of the evidence and one of the things that has come up once again is this supposed a recording of the murder\nRight we uh we think Gina Haspel has actually already over at the White House the president's intelligence briefing was for eleven thirty this morning so we're still trying to get a read on that uh the Washington Post reported earlier that she didn't listen to an audio recording of the of the show games uh\nAre both his interview I guess there was interrogation and his killing 'em we don't know that um you know we don't know for sure whether a that recording exists or whether it will become public but certainly that's the kind of leverage the Turks have not been afraid of\nOf putting out there against the Saudi saying you know your stories we don't believe your story we have a recording and that's really put the Saudis in a very tough spot as they try to explain away what happened\nSo what is the Saudis next move and the scandal\n[noise] well I think what we're seeing from them as an attempt to as much as possible defuse the tension with turkey um there's been a real clash between two you know too strong leaders of president ... on the Turkish side and the and Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... on I think\nUh this uh the crown prince yesterday made some a very positive comments about a call he had with aired on he also made some positive comments about Qatar which is unusual because uh the Saudis are leading a box of ... leading a group of nations that are blocking that country\nOr cutting that country off a and a Qatar is a is a close ally of turkey so that was seen as a little bit of dialing back the tension um I think the Saudis would like to make sure that no more no more evidence or no more conflicting storyline emerge that that make them look like\nThey haven't come forward with everything they know\nThe conflict if the Saudis are\nThey haven't come forward with everything they know beyond\nThe conflict if the Saudis are conceding that this was premeditated does that not put it closer to the crown prince it wasn't just something spontaneous\nIt though the next question you ask yeah the next question you have to ask in this case says okay or if it was premeditated who who ordered that\nUh and the Saudis have already removed a couple of people who are close to the crown prince uh they've detained some others yeah that's a that's the next logical step is um either did the ... either the crown prince ordered this\nUh or uh people are acting or doing some pretty horrific things without his knowledge which is not is not a great look for the crown prince either because he is really seen as the de facto rural or running a lot of uh almost everything that goes on in Saudi Arabia\nBill Ferris Bloomberg News national security team leader thanks for your time we're coming up on Bloomberg Politics policy power and law in New York state Seuss Exxon Mobil for the company's climate change claims but first we circle back to Bob ... for a check on world and national news Bob\nPeter thank you New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio is hailing the quick witted work of a security guard who alerted authorities do a suspicious device at Robert Deniro Manhattan office he said to have called police after seeing images of a package bombs set to CNN\nBy more than twenty five billion dollars over the lifetime those are some of the some of the things that they're saying and so they're saying this was really a fraud perpetrated on the public because they were\nGiving the public one set of costs that they said were related to the climate change but they were using another set lower when they were actually doing things on the ground and they weren't biting off things they might have righted are written off they weren't attributing more costs\nWhen they should have attributed more cause and so that's what they're saying they're saying it's a fraud under\nThe state Martin Act which is their New York's securities law which is a fairly broad statute and has been used by\nThe attorney general the of the state of New York or to bring all kinds of suits related to a stock issues stock market manipulation and things like that\nTo check this change from the kind of climate change lawsuits we've been seeing in which has been getting dismissed which blamed the fossil fuel industry for creating climate change this is really going back to the basics of a shareholder fraud last year was that the ... office has used so many times before\nThat that's correct tune that's exactly what they're doing they're saying that accent is committed fraud on the public good and and and people who bought their securities based on these\nStatements proxy statements public statements are up into fraud the state's been defrauded and they want them to pay you know stopped doing it and pay penalties and\nTo the extent there were any profits that are related to it to give up those profits and then but this is more in its it's obviously related to climate change but it's more in the context of your normal securities tied the lawsuit that the government would bring against the company\nExxon as we've discussed before has been waging a no holds barred counter attack against investigations by the New York ... as well as the Massachusetts ha investigations are politically motivated violate the first amendment and so on who seems to be winning that battle at this point\nNo oil at this point the really the government to have one boat New York and Massachusetts have a\nYou know beating back the effort by Exxon against the law suit dismissed their quashed to because of political considerations First Amendment considering all kinds of those things and um they really have been unsuccessful at this point it doesn't look like they are going to succeed\nI mean this so it looks like this is some this suit that will end up and left there is some kind of a settlement or you know going to trial at some point [noise] checked\nDuring the hearing before the New York giants in August the New York a G ... said that there were some smoking gun evidence that they had do they just closed that in the lawsuit in the allegations\nUm you know I haven't seen that but the they they probably could mean some of the things that they talked about to\nRead you know related to the oil and stuff in Canada and things like that and maybe that's what they're talking about I'm not I'm not that I haven't seen that to a gym\nThere but they're also alleging that this went to the top and that former CEO Rex Tillerson knew about these\nYes absolutely they said they they\nHave alleged that Rex Tillerson was intimately involved in doing this and played a key role in this whole effort\nYou know Exxon has been trying different ways to you know revive or brush up it's it's a reputation in this area how much damage will this lawsuit due to that\nThe area how much damage will this lawsuit due to that\nOh I think we'll do some damage to there's no doubt about it I think a lot will depend obviously and how it plays out the lawsuit but as you indicated Exxon\nHas done a lot of work they funded a lot of climate change report or they're not denying that climate change is you know is is manmade they're investing in a lot of renewable energy sources I think they're doing that [noise]\nYou know because it makes sense from a number of perspectives and so they're trying actually quite hard I think to a new indicated to burnish their reputation in this area and it's obviously a suit like this\nDoesn't help and I think a lot of depend on how it plays out and you know ... whether you get a lot of\nThings that are shown that have occurred to you know and and things that they depressed it's almost like the tobacco or\nLawsuits where as those lawsuits unfolded the information came out that the company's new way beforehand about this and that's the kind of I think those are the kinds of things that they run the risk of having happened to them\nAre I think so much jak That's Charles Warren of Kramer eleven Exxon spokesperson has said these baseless allegations are packed

in some ways the the way the clearest in terms of number one large population states and number two kind of swing states especially mid west where Democrats are pulling pretty well and governor's races they are going to for example\nVery likely win Michigan they will probably win Minnesota they'll probably win Iowa\nAnd joining us now ... news national reporter Margaret Newark New Kirk I should say on the phone from Atlanta thank you for joining us and so just how ... is this blue wave supposed to be\nHow well it looks like there's at least twelve Republican held seats that are in play and there are three of them are leaning Democrat and nature of our just mentioned one of them which is Michigan\nUm and then um nine are too close to call by most polls so\nThey're in debt hates that could go either way but these are Republican held seats that cost and what ... what are the more notable races\nBecause he's lemurs business we\nLost our non grade and that's not their lawn aside from the\nAnd editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine on the Internet for digital tattoo that could go viral it any metal\nFinance intact news as it have a retail is moving online at Amazon and it was a fourth of\nJuly ... murders as we as their energies inhaling murdered radio\nT I hate hang out in their day a lot of them are interactive broker studio what kind of Business Week for yeah terrorist act for twenty twenty Eighteen count on so long with Micah chasing Kelly where ... earnings because we're still following ... death case in a big rally\nSat in the after hours it's continuing today and that's just one of the stories were kept in touch you forgot my name there for a second time in the OJ had yeah yes and\nWonders invested he around the time every day All right we do have a lot to discuss a book before you get to that let's get two of them for business class with Charlie ...\nThank you very much Jason Kelly here's what's going on earnings front and center as you guys mentioned you'll be talking about it so for much of the program after Lubell keep in mind we'll be hearing from alphabet Amazon and intel and you've got to stick around for that final our training to see where we close and if it continues into tonight's Asian trading\nHere's where we stand we're seeing a surge in technology right now with ... one hundred Ninety One up to point seven percent S. and P. up forty six up one point eight percent the Dow advancing three hundred Seventy top one and a half percent\nYour tenure down eight thirty seconds you are right now three point one three percent gold down four tenths of one percent twelve twenty nine of the towns west Texas intermediate crude up nine cents more per se\nTo one percent twelve twenty nine of the towns west Texas intermediate crude up nine cents more per cent sixty seven forty three right now on W T died prime Charlie Palestine that there's a Bloomberg Business flash\nAnd thank you so much about I'm Jason Kelly alongside Carol ... ... oh yeah that guy yeah\nWe do have a lot to watch and I'm excited to get into it as it relates to the markets because it really is yesterday turned upside down can we get to try to them or do you hate me if I did that I Would not okay never got a great [laughter] John authors has meant that senior editor at Bloomberg Markets um it'll be\nNear me and then I got an ... a good anybody know they are Davis\nAnd the lights on going out there that John was the Financial Times for a lot longer than I've been a Bloomberg what'd you say something\nWell I feel like we have a you know a great brain train a tank few well in terms of the branch ... yeah I kind of ... frame tank I sat on [laughter] let's start with the markets 'cause it's a very different town we've got a rally underway tell what's your take on it\nBut she said at the moment it's pure resist a live yesterday a ... that that there's really nothing much to be on the people who were tracing the steps they took in particularly in the last couple of hours\nOn the left side versus if I can get waking up on the right side of that what's going on what happened with\nMy best my best guess strict ... was it yesterday was that this\nWas that there was a a a big sellouts with basic um for the ... they just up to the ones that are the most sensitive to the overall markets if you're a longer than the guy and you come get us a month to scare the rule or ... you being paid to do if you'll notice about the monkey you get a sense of\nUm particularly markets as tips dilks and get since particularly boring ones and so that seems to be exactly what's happened I spent\nA couple of happy I was learning using all my new toys I have here but [laughter] and and the one the one thing that really what were some stuff in there was this the\n... but at the base to just buying ... says goes up with the markets and staying with this has been a effect to this ... abnormally well for almost all of the Trump era and it's now actually locking them off kicks\nI'm full the Trump era no suddenly that just about the only thing that hasn't more or less perfectly resist like if you if you did that as sort of a\nGroup of ... ... ... ... soldiers to what they were yesterday afternoon like nothing nothing except but debates a rebound is not anything like the biggest debate to sell off yesterday\nAll right so let's bring in David Wilson on that because you to have been looking at it we thank God they talking about earnings make you a and sometimes investors are selling on the news that's different today\nRight I mean if you wanted a reason for the river so that's why today you know you could point to a fair number of earnings reports out there I mean you mentioned Tesla which arguably is its own sort of animal points given their history that's at\nFord Motor is up more than tablet today and they had already out late yesterday there were well received the Microsoft up five and a half percent after their results or you can point to a whole lot of other companies Twitter almost fourteen and a half percent and these sort of an interesting story\nBecause you know their fourth quarter revenue their physical fourth quarter actually came up short of estimates that people like what they heard as far as the current fiscal year goes and that stock after some initial hesitation is a three point six percent at the moment so there are enough stories like that\nRight you can point to the jazz that yeah as as much as earnings are an issue\nThey there are still some bright spots how certain\nTwitter your ... your best performers and yeah and he was really interesting to watch the market and what it did yesterday during regular trading and then as we watch these earnings come out after the bell\nOr checking our future to see if there was a bit of a ... to change it I think it took a while for the overall market to kind of buy into it but they certainly are buying it became an\nAncient was still alive or not to have a terrible yeah Hi Simon is I have a nice yeah so it's fitting that until Europe so ... so synthesize that for us John because what what is happening around the world versus the U. S. meticulous watching ... empty\nLet's let's take those two points separate the F ... I think in the case of what's happening with with China it's it's an unfortunate woods to apply to a market but I think it's a reasonable and we we have a body part of the market these days and that even even the eurozone to allow extensive just a derivative\nBoth the too far off the most important\nOr economic past which the U.S and China\nIt's obviously very tempting given how deep the excitement is here in the U.S about the presidents and he's a campaign of terrorists\nTo attribute what's going on in China to uh to the tribal I really don't see that as much more than an irritant or at the at the ... um if you look at Chinese since they've been sold off pretty brutally they didn't actually sell off that badly last night\nLike Japan put efficiently in their market ... as the day before\nYes exactly and ah they're a steel good reasons we've had the experience I don't like to ... ... it was much though I like the guy because he's so permanently embarrassed but this is probably\nThe guy talks about the ice age for marketing and had Twenty years yeah Ali a barrier eastern coast talking\nAbout that for since before I joined the front and how they have and everything but it's one of the points that he needs making these laces which I thought made sense is that\nPeople have a tendency to over extrapolate when one particular country has a good crisis so Japan and came through black Monday in Nineteen eighty seven relatively unscathed people's thoughts to discover the ... year of life\nThey were wrong or Alan Greenspan help us get through the dot com crash in remarkably unscathed a leading to the final period of the Greenspan era when people don't people don't want to\nBroker Woodward's book was golden maestro et cetera et cetera you know what happened after that and they'll see China does have a very good crisis you know eats\nLeading to perhaps for confidence that you just never bets against the the these Chinese technocrats that just so good at some points ... even ... technocrats is not going to be able to to deal with the amount of\nCredit overhang maybe in China and that is a great\nGreat underlying concern that's going on for quite a bit\nWorried about a ... yeah can I say if you want an sites like what you just heard you've already talked about my charge of the day when he hears\nJohn as a brand new newsletter out it's called points of return I sent an email ... everybody on my list about it I Know some folks who signed up for re runs of followers take like that\nYeah absolutely so I recommend it you know you can find that the album Bloomberg opinion I Believe in the go from there it's it's well worth it\nFor free just like my charged emails [noise]\nDavid Wilson and Selma very impressed by the mail wild hasn't quite ... years of practice to get I Wonder if\nWe can take a step back because I Do you think everybody is at a interesting juncture in trying to figure out okay wherever we go from here you know we've had such a run up certainly in the U.S equity markets you know\nFor the entire planet so we are paying for we're subsidizing it everybody else's benefiting and they are paying nothing poured research and development\nThe world rapes the benefits of American Genius and innovation while American citizens and especially our great seniors or hit the hardest pick up the tab but no longer\nHere is just a few examples for one eye medication that helps prevent blindness Medicare pays over one billion dollars a year\nIf we paid the price as other nations pay we'd bring the one billion dollars down to one hundred and eighty seven million dollars a year\nIt's pretty amazing is that we spend more than a billion dollars a year or two drugs to treat bone disease but we could save more than eight hundred million dollars I think of that eight hundred billion dollars saving\nFor our seniors by paying the price as other countries pay nothing special just the prices that other countries pay that's the way the United states\nThe other countries pay\nThat's the way the United states has been disrespected for too long\nIn too many ways\nOne common cancer drug is nearly seven times as expensive for Medicare as it is for other countries is a highly use\nAnd very effective drug and it's seven times more expensive not fair\nThis happens because the government pays whatever price the drug companies set without any negotiation whatsoever\n[noise] not anymore under our new plan the department of health and Human Services would allow Medicare\nTo determine the price it pays for certain drugs based on the cheaper prices paid by other nations some people call it favorite nations clauses we have them in business we have them in a lot of different contracts that I've seen over the years and been part of favored nations\nSo think of the so we're paying a price based on the price of the other nations that thing that's what we're going to pay\nNo longer seven times more no longer ten times eleven times even twelve times more I've seen examples paying the same price couldn't ... billions and billions of savings to people the people\nWe will no longer accept the inflated prices being charged to our seniors but I had a congressman respected congressman come to the oval office when say Center for my constituents drug pricing is more important than health care\nAnd I said explained it to them but he actually said drug ... I've never forgotten the expression drug pricing we know how important health care is drug pricing is even more important for my constituents at long\nLast the drug companies in foreign countries will be held accountable for how they rigged the system against American consumers this is a revolutionary change nobody's had the courage to do it or\nThey just didn't want to do it and\nThis is a change for the people this is not a change for industry or for companies or for pharma\nThis is a change for the people that will be substantially a reduction in drug prices for our people and our senior citizens tremendous tremendous difference our plan will also fix a broken payment system where doctors are reimbursed\nMore if they prescribe a much more expensive drug\nUnder a new proposed claimants system doctors will be paid\nA flat rate than when you think of it it's like being a contract or anything else\nIf it's an expensive drug or a less expensive drug\nIt's the same doesn't take any more and I think this will be good in terms of the pricing of the drug be fantastic for that but it'll also be much better for patients and it very well may be better for doctors\nThis follows other significant actions that we have taken to protect Medicare for our great seniors\nWe have given the plans that serve more than forty five million seniors on Medicare part D and twenty million seniors on Medicare Advantage new tools to negotiate lower prices\nThanks to our actions this year premiums for both Medicare part D and Medicare Advantage have an I'll I'll give you a word that you haven't\nEver heard ever heard have gone down\n[noise]\nAnd you've been listening to President Trump speaking at the department of health and Human Services down in Washington speaking about drug prices something he has talked about Carole you going back to the campaign or we've seen\nA drug stocks trade up and down depending on his commentary let's make sense of what the president is up to on this especially as we get closer and closer to these midterm elections Brian rye is senior health care policy analyst at Bloomberg intelligence or joining us from our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studio\nIn Washington Brian a great to be with you so help us understand what's going on down there [laughter]\nEasier said than done I guess anytime you talk about this particular issue in this case he's talking about a particular class of medicines that are reimbursed under Medicare part B programming when I say that you know these orange ... pills that you might go get a trick or a pharmacy these are typically the\nThe higher cost biologic medicine that are infused than either a hospital setting\nOr in a physician's office and as the president alluded to the reimbursement formula that physicians get for that\nSort of encourages actually a higher price that the average selling price plus six percent so if you're a physician and you're sitting there with two equivalent therapeutically equivalent drugs in one cost ten thousand dollars in one is one thousand dollars\nAnd you think you get six percent of either one of six hundred dollars is a lot more than sixty and so those are the types of built in incentives that they're trying to reverse a with a couple of these proposals\nHow much of what goes on in terms of higher drug prices whether it's for these you know the drugs that you talked about that are being ... Medicare part B\nHow much of the higher costs though has to do is kind of the infrastructure have got pharmaceutical maker is you've got middlemen um where is it that the prices go up\nSo high I think we can separate this the other class we talked about the the part the the um uh where you have the ... and the insurers all competing and you know that's an area where I think the administration is actually pretty good shape as the president said towards the end you actually you have seen Medicare part D premiums are going down next year versus where they are this year and\nYou know seniors are pretty happy with the types of choices they have they're I think the change that the administration is pushing on that front is to actually give those ... and insurers even more power in terms of [noise]\nThree more package it how many separating fact me suspected python center former vice president Joe Biden and actor Robert De Niro bringing the total number to at least ten investigators try to narrow the search for science\nThat Congress and like my call him the Republican chairman of the house homeland security committee and in that position he gets regular updates on the investigation and he told us this morning investigators are using postal markings on sound like a pack a day can air that focus but he wouldn't get into specific region during our interview\nNoxious Katherine Harris in Washington and the U.S postal service says it is working closely with law enforcement no one's been hurt at this hour President Trump is focusing on prescription drug prices boxes John decker live at the White House\nJust days before the midterm elections President Trump will unveil a plan to lower the cost of drugs including negotiating for some drugs that are directly administered by doctors the Trump Administration says that Medicare could save more than Seventeen billion dollars over five years with the cost of some drugs dropping by as much as thirty percent\nEarlier this month the president signed the bill banning so-called gag clauses that prohibited pharmacist from telling patients when they could save money by paying cash or trying a lower cost alternative medicine\nHealthcare has emerged as a hot issue in the ... at least so thanks Jon ...\nHot issue in the ...

from now it has\nTo be starting in Tennessee with the wind by Marsha Blackburn we'll get to that and much more straight ahead\nReally strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today a I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWell he votes with them when they count so you know I don't like to count on naming of post office is a procedural vote but\nI Do not have well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have viewed as his vote health care being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state\nSean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and matching said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think that West Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\nJoe mansion how to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue\nWhen it matters Manchin says no and even I have it all where people say oh we ended up voting for capping off\nThe reality is he waited he actually left the Senate a voting chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then to Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that it was politically dead\nHis toe so I you know I kind of view a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you don't vote for the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people of West Virginia and wish I would say on important issues like tax cuts regulation energy those are three main fundamental issues that that affect an impact\nThe economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places have struggled with a ... opioid issues and we have with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joe Manchin first vote will be for Chuck Schumer\nAnd Chuck Schumer is made no bones about the fact that he's going to head out the obstruction resistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're powering these liberals\nThe folks that really created all the rock distorting the Kavanaugh hearings then you're part of the problems so that's why people were so focused on Joe mansions first vote because you know he's not going to be with West Virginia and he's going to be part of a team that's tearing down the president West Virginia's don't want that\nAnd that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia to try and keep in other words how much is Schumer and company in ... in company or are they investing in these negative ads about you\n[noise] well they put a fortune and I think by a ... by all accounts they're going to probably be up for over twenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more we're going to look at the final ...\nAnd that's what happens on you mentioned earlier you know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now\nThe president came back twice he's actually our side we think he's going to come back again and we start to combat twelve ten eight six to for that to you know to even\nThat's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen lives are early voting began in West Virginia as it started out\nEarly yeah early voting started yesterday and so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have a lot of energy\nAnd people know that the future of the Senate to really be at stake what this election and that there's a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it we're not hockey but we're going to out worked Joe mansion and people are gonna know on the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion is it dishonest lost some good liberal\nAnd he's never there when you need 'em\nAll right we're watching this race now put this in the ... column a where we once thought it was a leaning Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda or is this Joe Manchin sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a deadline and race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help\nA future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish all the best Patrick Morrisey\nHey Shaun thanks so

Papadopoulos on Capitol Hill\nWearing report that he just left his hearing today and we will hear from lawmakers as well as alive report from John Heinz coming right up after the break\n[noise]\n\nNot ... not withstanding these charges of ah that that to he pled guilty to a earlier so it seems like it was a very productive hearing a also Mark Meadows saying that he was absolutely astounded astounded that this narrative of Russia inclusion this investigation this whole thing was able to\nContinue based on what he said was a very shaky very weak\nFoundation which is the story that supposedly George Papadopoulos told to someone who's in pass it on to that a Australian ambassador who then got the authorities in case Patrick\nWe'll just let me ask you again and you just mentioned it Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying for the FBI and you were one of the few reporters who were is able to walk and talk with them today as he\nArrived and as we left what's his demeanor today does he think confidence in this path who's chosen how does he think\n\nHe seemed very confident Patrick may seemed optimistic he seemed like someone who I think had a weight lifted off with him I think that we also actually talk to him when he came in in the morning and I talk to them and I said do you want to talk to reporters are you going to talk to reporters afterwards\nAnd he said yes I Want to talk to reporters a he said he couldn't get into any specifics as he said when he left but\nWhen he was leaving he had a very positive uh I guess attitude\nAnd so based on that based on the information that Congress Mark Meadows also John Ratcliffe of Texas a talking to reporters briefing reporters\nSaying that they received a lot of information but also making the same points that there was really a very flimsy basis to begin this entire investigation this Russian collusion narrative\nPapadopoulos does not know anybody in Russia is not have contact with Russia and she doesn't speak Russian probably didn't even see doctor Zhivago ever so this is piling up to really we're down to the argument that I think a lot of the Republicans have had\nThat really this whole thing has been blown out of proportion remember this is just based on a story that supposedly an anecdote that Papadopoulos received from this uh\nThis professor of this uh in in England in the u._k. about the Russians dropping all of these emails from Hillary Clinton Bernie passing on to this Australian ambassador then got the authorities and cash but there is no connection there is no basis for that that's basically here say the\nThe courtroom term would be here say Patrick ... and so that's what are lawmakers were pointing today when that came out and talk to reporters both a reckless and met a ...\nAh just quickly John what's next to you you said that lawmakers seem confident as it came out but are they satisfied should we expect to see Papadopoulos back on Capitol Hill\n\nWill actually Mark Meadows talking to reporter said that he would like to see Papadopoulos testify in an open session in public with the media in the in the hearing room so that would be a possibility\nI think that that as this goes on I think there might be some more just station more support for that notion and I think Papadopoulos based on what meadows so it\nWould be interested in doing that because as he said the congressman he has been very open very transparent so it seems like a person who would like to the story out so indeed I think we may see more of Mr Papadopoulos and we may see some more of the other witnesses but on top of ... Papadopoulos some particular is interested in getting his story out Patrick\nAlright congressional reporter and film buff apparently with a doctor Zhivago a reference John I live on Capitol Hill as
