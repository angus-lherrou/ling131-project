that for only but only like a suit\nMe or or already Harry\nFor guys didn't carry look I don't want to denigrate the guys with her name's Kerry bay on Lake ... someone who's going to really get always cracks me up when she was able to get a call from somebody uh it's it's Carey or Kelly on line to go they just wanted to see what I'm doing I was a number\nBack at it it's going to be John in Boca Raton John what's going on high\nI think is very simple law of economics about their situation you know I was I was a supply of your home depot and all they\nDid as move in with their big huge stores\nIf you want to see her as yet it goes through the nuts and bolts and whatever else and find something at a little door right with all they do they have every day and you could you walk in there\nAnd you name it it got it forty different sizes so it's better than being on line going right in there and that that's what the biggest Richard are voting\nBut what is it a negative is yours is going away or they just didn't keep up with the times\n\nThat that's a good question I Would say that it's negative one stores close but Sears just couldn't be contagious economic battle then on the book came in and blew the boy I Hope it doesn't happen too much with other stores but it can they've got to take steps to avoid it got to everything perfect buddy\nJohn I hear you I appreciate that poll actually been a very good point during the break um he said well is because years or so late to getting anything on line or what would you say they they don't have an apple or something\nYeah I mean I've never seen an ad for them and and then when they're talking about when the last time was and it went in there it was recently but it was because I Would have park somewhere and I was just walking through there to get somewhere else\nI bought a riding lawnmower from seniors probably Thirteen fourteen years ago was the last time I stepped foot in the store\nSo I get that it's been that long ago I used to be a serious guy going to know somebody who thought it was great store but ah yeah I mean you do everything on line and if you didn't keep up with the online but you got left behind like like newspapers today are trying to catch up they really screwed up because online news sources\nWay to do just took over immediately online cable you know our access to the you got Eighteen different cable news channels why would I pay for a newspaper my front yard at this point\nYou don't have to so they're starting to catch up there when we come back from break it's going to be ... about the Godzilla movie about Elizabeth Warren and the ... coming back\nAnd that to me really is is the real offense here of of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color but they're not people of color while they're bracing stony like Rachel do at all and and Elizabeth Warren\nAnd all through shown to hang in there as well each Oh yes and I salute\nLe show Morgan um show molten dot com due to read her blog or what you do you see a room as you know you're going to re TV show on TV where she's at noon incredible investigative reporting um I wanted to do about this does know movie I didn't know what your attachment was doing turns out it was really hard to raise money\nFor this movie it's basically a movie about well it's actually called the wine with America's biggest serial killer I Believe this guy was\nAmerica's biggest serial killer one show so much trouble to make obviously a very interesting\nUm ...\nWell the the bottom line is that the a radical abortion is and the Democratic party and on the left\nI Do not want to acknowledge the horrors that are committed in the name of so called reproductive choice and my attachment to the movie into the story goes back to two thousand eleven when almost nobody else was paying attention to the story I and I first blogged about the grand jury report\n'em in the indictments against Kermit gods now who murdered multiple born alive babies as well as being responsible for the death of a woman in in his clinic\nI'm back in in twenty eleven and ah what was stunning about this grand jury report that was issued and you know Democrat liberal Philadelphia or was that they acknowledged that time and time and again government agencies as well as women's advocates looked the other way at the blatant\nCereal crimes that were going on I'm essentially out in the open and so when an ... and feel I'm ...\nI decided that they were going to first write an investigative book about uh the crimes and then I'll turn them into a movie I volunteered to use my platform any way that I could to help them and initially they tried to crowdsource the movie on\nA Kickstarter and were kicked off by pro abortion sensors that website they had to go to Andy go go and I donated personally three times to the movie and so did many thousands and thousands of other small donors rating to point three million dollars to get this movie made and it\nEnded up in the top ten of movies this weekend despite\nA campaign to to shut up any kind of publicity for the movie\nAnd again it's ... dot com boom she was ... does no trial America's biggest serial killer whales the rumble raising money on Facebook and how about advertising on on the NPR I mean there was a ... everywhere\nEverywhere that trade Facebook up a block them from putting promoted ads on an NPR refused to to run an ad that told the truth about\nWho ... well now was he was an abortion doctor right and they objected to this plane a description of of who he was and what he was and again it goes back to um all of the grim euphemisms that are used by the left and the media to cover up what actually goes on in these abortion clinics it's\nBeen a long time since Jeffrey Dahmer do discussing things he did we do about them in pop culture in news stories and so on we never hear about this guy and all this guy used used talk the way the media doesn't want to talk about um the lip does want to talk about them Planned Parenthood does want to talk about um that's on purpose right\nIt is it absolutely is on purpose and that he really should be in that same pantheon of of the most infamous a serial killers who are in so many ways glorified\n'em by the mainstream media and by Hollywood and\nUm and I think that it I I think with regard to the gods now um I've I've made it very clear about the movie on the book by the way that it is appropriate and safe for um teenagers to see this movie and um it is rated rated PG Thirteen and there's an incredible cast\nA including dean Cain Earl Billings Sarah Jane Morris uh next year see and I'm Andrew clay and who was the screenwriter here an incredibly brave and and bold um film that I Believe is at the intersection of art and investigative journalism\nVisual dimension you watch your show on TV also good Web sites which I'm old enough to what you see on TV over the place we political commentator great mind\nYou and I realized because of the students as we take that we're going to be discriminated against by the mainstream we get that but how does mix usually get away with that has dean king take the Jews how did these that because a lot of doctors told the next to the movies I Will act in your movie because if I Will never be able to take some didn't\nIt did and you know that I was at the premiere last week in Los Angeles in a theater in Beverly Hills\nAnd you know this is hostile territory for outspoken conservatives and so\nIt made it all the more point to me to be able to meet so many people who worked on the film or who were behind the scenes people who are\nUm you know stage a crew um and and then I met a lot of people who um are you still have are not as a ... in a position to come out about their politics you know the ... um actors or\nUm filmmakers are director's um but I think that\nThe actors or um filmmakers are director's um but I think that you know as a result of everything that's been happening over the last a year or two years it's really in Boulder people to come out who who wouldn't have otherwise spoken out before and that's a good thing\nI Want to be able to go see this movie it's goes no trial with America's biggest serial killer this is Michelle ... comment and again watch your TV show on TV one last quick question I I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you this\nHeading into the midterms I got to think the Kavanaugh effect looks really good for our side but we're so far away from the election do you think that conservatives we we take a chance to people starting to relax and sit on their own their hands again on an election that we need them to be empowered and get out there and vote\nThat it absolutely right and I and I think that it's not just the Kavanaugh effect but even you know the this latest um peroxide of mob violence that's broken out all across the country the thing is that the left can never help itself\nAnd on the heels of even just this past weekend where we had Hillary\nOpening up her mouth or anything that's another gift ah with her excusing her husband's abuses of power in the Lewinsky scandal right and then on top of that Hillary and bill going on there are corrupt to lose a speed\nCore and now all of it and making an forced error with Eric how old are you do is sit back and let these people the clown why or how\nIt Eric Holder just kick us in the face while we're down or something yeah\nWhat does not get in a way of themselves so I I Hope\nThey keep on talking to the next few weeks but it seems I don't want her side of her get about which has happened with cabinet because people are sick and even those who are center left or sickened by one Feinstein in the group that\nThat's exactly right and you know a lot of the investigative work I've done for the last two years has focused on wrongful convictions\nAnd particularly false allegations of rape and it has crossed many logical lines even out a lot of left us won't talk about it they know what's happened with the burden of proof in America and they know that what happened to Brett Kavanaugh could happen to\nAnyone and so this this this mid term it's not just a a referendum on chops versus mop it really is about\nDue process those things we hold dear\nUm and the fact that you know many families and parents look at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh look at his daughters and his wife and I think to themselves I've got to protect my daughters but I also have to protect my son my husband my uncles and my grand\nAuthors

Mohammad this begins to feel like the Cold War Tom the ethics and the CIA recruiting men who have been executed by Shabaab\nYeah well actually Shabaab executed these guys who were ... they were allegedly recruited by the U.S British\nIntelligence and smiling intelligence to spy on Shabaab or to cause problems for Shabaab\nEdge Bob like other all kinds of branches does this fairly regularly they have a campaign to take out certain alleged spies to try and show that they are you know have infiltrated the ranks and that there's going to be accountability for that now what they're trying to tie this back to both the air campaign that we just were talking about with the U.S has been watching these drone strikes against targets\nBut also to the Islamic State's president so\nThis isn't Shabaab Shabaab of course opposed the Islamic state just dissolve all kind of does\nAnd in Somalia the Islamic state has an upstart presidents that trying to basically carve out a niche from within Shabaab to try and challenged buffers authority\nThat's far Shabaab is is the far stronger dry player and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon Islamic state presence is much smaller but Shabaab is part of its information campaign to try and undermine the Islamic state is accusing some of these spies including one in particular who allegedly worked for and my six\nOf taking money from the Brits and giving it to the Islamic state in Somalia to try and basically a build up the Islamic State's presidents and strengthen it at your Bob's expense I think that's probably more propaganda or information warfare and their part to try and undermined the Islamic State's legitimacy but you know the details all get very murky very quickly\nUm we just have a minute to your knowledge is the U.S seeking to negotiate with Shabaab the way it's negotiating with the Afghanistan Taliban\nYou know John that's a great point you know the top on what's happened with his negotiates with the U.S us the same as a tall bonds Islamic emirate is somewhat legitimate in Afghanistan and of course it's all about our Maine's cool see out while I was kind of the day on the other hand Shabaab which is part of al ... is trying to build its Islamic emirate and of course the U.S is not negotiating with\nThem and so we have two countries going in the same direction under a kite is a mantle and the U.S is negotiating with one part of al ... is linked but not negotiating with the other part yet yet we can't rule it out in the future tough\nYeah I mean nothing can be ruled out at this point I I doubt Shabaab whatever agreed any sort of overt negotiations with the American side um because America doesn't have the substantial foreign over there and ... that it doesn't have guessed\nI'm Justin who keeps the long war journal he's a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy\nThis segment national security report brought to you by scholars scholars a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation visits scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience I'm John bachelor\n\nThe investigation underway I'm Lisa ...

Iraq right now it's very very good so John\nI go to you again on this ABC poll about sixty nine battleground districts these are the ones where the Democrats are ambitions to pick up seats against the Republicans because Mrs Clinton did very well in these districts in sixteen though they have a Republican\nCongressional member right now and what is the generic spread John and what does this tell you about this paradox of a good economy and democratic momentum\nWell I Would make an amendment to your statement the economy is good but Donald Trump is still a drag on Republicans a he has alienated a lot of suburban women having said that the ABC Washington Post poll I ... I mean it's only one poll but it's a solid one\nUm the Democrats have a generic lead of almost ten in that poll but on the sixty six swing districts twenty four which went for Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen the Republicans are ahead\nBy one point the Republican now other polls don't quite show that that they show that the\nSwing districts are much closer because Democrats are going to waste a lot of their enthusiastic votes\nIn districts they were going to win anyway so I think in CBS back the CBS background poll also believes that if the election were held with normal turnout today they will be a two hundred making two hundred and Seventeen split not clear which party whatever majority\nI think we're heading to a much closer house um resolve them people anticipate because the battleground districts are not the country\nThat is you have institutional memory because you wrote through the title wave for the blue in two thousand and six and you also saw what\nA block Obama as a candidate he did in two thousand and eight how do you read how do you interpret this as one poll I understand that it's moving story but how do you interpret this this unusual fact that the battleground districts the Republicans do well in\nI mean is much better now than it was back in those six and a weight as Mr fungus can tell you and I\nMade it exceedingly difficult for the Republicans and majority in two thousand six and for Republicans in general in two thousand eight because we've already lost the majority in\nIn the prior election uh my question for Mr fund is you're talking about the house one about the Senate\nWell the sound is very interesting because there's poll movement in places you didn't expect\nA there's a new poll out a conducted by a democratic firm that shows the Minnesota special election for the Senate to be competitive in clear single digits New Jersey there's a very hard hitting ad attacking senator Menendez the Democratic incumbent for\nSex with teenage prostitutes are quoting FBI reports from the Obama Justice department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats and they expect\nIs this department um I think that the Democrats are now defending more seats than they expected him if I had if the election were held today I think Republicans would gain Senate seats and game of clear advantage it can hurry more judges including a possible mothers Supreme Court appointment backs to your\nBest to fund the Democrats were doing very well talking about health care health care health care I saw that on ads for the last two weeks and yet these other issues have come up a it's a puzzle to me\nIs is a lack of discipline or is this because in two thousand and six the Democrats in the house had the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and as far as I can tell she's completely disappeared I Can't find her\nWell remember about forty democratic challengers have said they're not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi should they get elected\nSo the last thing that she wants to do is remind voters that um she's there it is trying to become the next democratic speaker even though many members of her party clearly recognized she uses liability on the campaign trail\nThat is made me realize as you well know jobs when they get there and they started getting shall we say acclimated to their caucus those votes can change dancer\n[noise] well yeah I Wonder if you have only two hundred and twenty Democrats or Nineteen or two hundred and Twenty one you know Thaddeus it has been since Nineteen fifty two that\nWe had the congressional majority that was less than five seats are from two hundred may team we've never before in living memory had an extremely close house where every member counts because the speaker has to be elected with two hundred and Eighteen the majority of the entire house\nI watch Tony clips from CBS the sixty minutes interview between the president and the correspondence but I was struck by one thing John and I'm puzzled whether this is too late or too little the president is acting very presidential these days he's quite\nHe's quite clear about his accomplishments he's expansive about the policies that they've initiated there's nothing hesitant about 'em at all is that is that showing in the polls job\nWell actually Leslie stall who conducted the interview said our interview the president three times as candidate as president elect and that was president the the change in his level of self confidence and assertiveness is dramatic ah she says he's he seems to have grown into the job in the country may not be comfortable with him and the job but he's comfortable with it\nI didn't see a president shooting from the hip I saw a man who who was prepared for the issues you know how he makes a little pyramid out of his fingers you know and he's confident that the man I saw in that in that interview\nHe's on this message discipline I think through the election if it stays that will only help his party\nThat is meant just got a counselor Mr fund the greatest thing I've heard about the country may not be comfortable with him he just comfortable in the job [laughter]\n... what do you do you think that this will translate in the next couple of weeks the messaging the tight messaging if the president and more parents whose because he's not going to stop campaigning for the rest of the Republicans\n[noise] no but I think that the Democrats submitted enough mistakes he's just going to remind voters over and over again but even though they may have difficulty with him look at the other guys\nAnd by the way given you know Elizabeth Warren given Hillary Clinton and given ... Kavanaugh given Michael ... you know the other team doesn't exactly look like professional ... of governing hurts you\nKnow child if if I was struggling with comparable actors on the Republican side I think I'd change the subject my goodness\nWhat a mole law especially mentioning ... who's now a who's now a curse if he raise money for you everywhere he goes good heavens John fun he's in Budapest, Hungary\nThe Democrats political science says gain the house that's going to happen or is it\nThat is McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes I'm John bachelor\n\nThe investigation underway I'm Lisa ... Fox News Saudi Arabia conducting its own investigation into the disappearance of journalists ... went missing three weeks ago at the sound the consulate in Turkey\nInvestigate to spend at least five dollars at the consulate Saudi team and took his friends at least know to me cleaning crew also ride out the head of the most now the European Union is also looking around and says Sunday Riyadh reacted angrily to political and economic threat\nSo with the case saying the kingdom Muslims it's total rejection of any threats an attempt to undermine it if it received any action it will respond with greater action\nSaudi state media then suggested a hike in oil prices to a hundred dollars if not two hundred dollars about in another development king Solomon and president do to want to talk he spoke by telephone Sunday evening with both attempting to calm the situation\nIssues will we see Iran and Russia now reaching a deal to circumvent us sanctions according to a number of reports that they'll supply crude oil Iran to to Russia's who the Caspian and then it would be exported worldwide\nWe've seen reports that I'm Indian vessels were taking on Iranian oil then going to to ... to um Kuwait filling up and then selling it as if it is a it is Kuwaiti oil and the agreement with the Russians were supposedly reach last month\nWhen put president to boot and an Iranian President Rowhani met in Tehran and the the the other sanctions the other um it is exposure about\nThe efforts by Iran to ah to impose sanctions to to avoid the sanctions in the administration warn the world's banks\nThat they may try to use these duplicitous means to minimize the sanctions in panic they continue to fund terrorism and there's\nSigns that the the flow of oil seems to be according to new data from September that the oil industry is still quite robust and and it means that they are using a subterfuge and and other means like the example of India um\nTo uh to bypass or to cover their uh their exports so sanctions banning transactions with the Iran central bank the shipping comes to oil companies are all scheduled to take effect on November fifth\nSo it could be that they're trying to rush to these things these as much as they can export and now but it is certainly indicative of the weakness of the Iranian economy we know the teachers went on strike today we know that the price of milk has has gone up sharply and other goods that cannot tomato paste\nSold for sixty thousand ... in March is now a hundred and eighty thousand ... and the ... self that currency as a has fallen so dramatically I think it's a hundred and forty six thousand to the dollar now\nAnd the projection is that the Iranian economy will shrink by one point five percent or this year and maybe almost four percent and twenty Nineteen\nSo Iran is under a lot of pressure that the sanctions will work the new sanctions could be very significant in the U.S has to find ways to close these loopholes\nThat in America you guys are using their brain recent reports show the Gazans believe the ... the bigger problem than from us\nIt's exactly right I think Palestinians over oil\nA blamed the PA by a bigger percentage than than the blame the um uh the Hamas for for\nWhat is happening and it and and it's reflected his lack of confidence\nAnd it shows that in the election or change is not going to bring about any uh any dramatic or a difference so we were seeing the um uh the the numbers that ... that came out that the more than almost fifty percent almost half\nA do not trust the PA they don't trust Hamas necessarily but they certainly don't trust the Palestinian authority and this is a you know a very significant figure when you're looking at what are their prospects for a a\nChanging things in in the ... and and the guy in gossip for instance because if forty three percent of Palestinian state of ... responsible for the bad situation and only a quarter blamed a Hamas\nAnd that and that's why they don't want to demonstrate against Hamas 'cause they don't like the alternative and they don't want to ... to take over and and especially don't like it measures against its own citizens\nThe fact that was another study that's coming up that shows a tremendous number of arrests by the Palestinian authority figures against those who oppose it in the west bank\nSo they they seem to accept Hamas control of Gaza\nIn Europe outcome I have learned because you taught me the Europeans have a profoundly different understanding of anti Semitism than we do here in the United states I don't know where it started but I Do know it's here today\nAnd Israel has always struggled against that anti Semitic tone in all of the major France Germany Great Britain\nOr Italy we struggled with it bought you indicate there is there a change is there and in light meant in Europe are they pulling back from their exploitation of ah the the tragedy of the twentieth century\n[noise] [noise] ah it's it's a good question but I I think it goes too far to think that the the tail pulled back what we're seeing according to this latest survey that the Israeli foreign minister\nDid in in major European countries\nShow a clear rise in support and this is the first time in memory for me that um there's been a turnaround\nIn in Germany in Spain and Portugal in Romania where in Romania to support for Israel grew to fifty six percent in Portugal or it went to forty eight percent and and versus thirty percent were not supportive\nIn Spain it was forty percent in Britain it went up the eight points to forty percent\nAnd this you know in the core of an area era and everything else and with all the negative media and and measures that were adopted into campaigns in Europe against Israel to see this a turnaround I think it's it's really remarkable and it will tell you some it is not something I Would have been dissipated\nAnd the fact that in all these major ... countries in Europe or sympathy for Israel is increasing maybe it's a greater understanding of the um of Israel's unique position maybe it's because today the middle east includes or did they see what's going on in Syria they see what's going on in these other countries that have come\nTo realize that you have one source of stability\nAnd um you will have to see whether this is borne out over time but it's certainly a a surprising about\nWe have a minute that is that you know must remember that the people in Europe are different than the elite that would deem to govern ...\nThat is true in the countries like Britain and forget where it starts top down France tendency is to be bottom up but I think you're quite right that that that is a distinction and and still the numbers are not as positive as they should be\nAnd we see the campaigns continuing but this split the left right split that is exacerbating things may also tend to benefit the understanding of Israel\nJeremy Corbyn notwithstanding correct Malcolm that would be a tragedy\nVery much a tragedy and and the very fact that that ah he continues in in the current path in Britain is very disturbing may be part of this is a reaction to

mean just\nImpacted plus with\nTrees cheered off tangles of power lines in the streets boats piled up like they were ... votes in a bath tub thrown upside down just things you don't normally see

would make fun of me I'm In the ten years I've done the show you know we'd be talking about emergency go bags and things you had to do\nAnd sell it on the show and people will say oh come on really do I really think unless you have to have emergency kids are you really doing that and the answer is yes because imagine this is going to hit landfall what are you got packed up what about your documents 'cause wanted shredded like tooth picks\nYou're not finding those bills you're not finding the stuff that you need to find to to get through a what you have to get through\n... and you're not finding it and hopefully you've got it written down somewhere and that's basically what it looks like it looks like people are just trying to piece things together I mean people lose all their belongings like that who you're just stuck you know somebody said when they were asked about why didn't you get out\nI think are not even part of the equation oh that's terrible what happened to that I Know you cannot bring back a life in some of these cases of twisted sick\nJust ... in human acts so I think it's warranted of course is someone shouldn't receive the death penalty and it has been investigated to within an inch of any possible evidence that it would be the best case scenario since Thursday\nThe Washington and people are listening to us from Washington Washington Supreme Court declared its death penalty unconstitutional\nAnd um it's the twenty state to band or says spend any way capital punishment\nThe state's highest court didn't rule the death penalty illegal in of itself but rather the way it's been carried out so saying that it's an arbitrary and racially biased\nA lot of people who are legal scholars say that this is the latest step toward the\nContinued abolition of the death penalty that this move and instead\nYou know having these life in prison sentences it's going to become more of the rule than the exception yeah we've seen other legislatures current things over court six hundred New Jersey New York\nAnd there was a nationwide moratorium on the death penalty that was lifted in the mid seventies so executions actually peak at Ninety eight Ninety nine but they declined since then twenty three and twenty Seventeen Eighteen so far this year\nAnd it's the dilemma it's the moral dilemma is the ethical dilemma it's the legal dilemma it's the wrestling with that it's people who disputed it's see because I'm open minded and look at all sides of it and like get that\nIf you want it to look at all my ideologies you say well they don't match up and I don't care because that's why I say I don't care if you're left of left or right of writers somewhere in between or you say I don't need a label I Am who I Am and I vote for the person that I look at the issue\nAnd so for me diving deeper was the norm in my family and you made up your own mind whether people agree with you or not in your own family or outside of your own family\nI think the good thing is in the places where it slow down\nWhen people were deciding the death penalty and the harshest punishment they could decide they really ...\nDeath penalty and the harshest punishments they could decide they really took things into account let's say\nThey really taken into account\nNow one of the big arguments that I'll get is well it's supposed to be a deterrent but isn't really a deterrent house at deterring heinous crimes because we're still things terrible things happen\nAnd I guess it depends yeah and it also depends on your philosophy sometimes religious belief come into play are you an eye for an eye person do you really feel that way I just know from myself personally at a crime at a very young age and\nSeeing some on believable a brutal things happen to completely innocent people destroying their families making\nSo many weep uncontrollably and bringing them to their knees like I've never seen before in my life\nAnd knowing that definitely they had nailed\nThe case shut that this was the way to go and does it bring relief does it bring\nUp of\nA rap and lose tend to tie up for the family know because once somebody is taken away you can never get them back and\nIt doesn't necessarily have that feeling maybe some would say that but I think most it's the opposite they they say they thought they would feel\nThey would feel relief but they don't necessarily feel release though where this goes is going to be pretty telling him pretty interesting I think\nI'm politically speaking ties to the past\nThat kind of thing but the fact that\nThe impact of the jury's decision to impose the death sentence if there is a racist taint to it to the practice of it then no a African Americans make up about Thirteen percent of the U.S population they account for thirty four point three percent of the defendants who were executed\nThose are clearly statistics from death penalty in Information Center I'm Seventy six percent of the victims in that case\nAnd the cases that resulted in execution were white so this is where some of this discussion also goes to attitudes and numbers and all of that and regions and\nWhat the what\nPreviously was acceptable not being acceptable now I think it's always worth the debate and to have a discussion and look closer at it\nBut I think we're going to see that fall it's interesting because in ten years I think we're going to have legalized marijuana and every single state taxes maybe it'll last to do it I don't know but\nI Do think that's going to happen because of the money that's being made what it's doing for the states there are some really crazy things you have to deal with when you're talking about marijuana and legalizing it but I Do believe\nBased on what we're seeing with cannabis companies and even\n\nIn ten years\nI think it's legalized in ten years\nAnd I think there's so many other issues that we dance around or we talk about that it won't be any closer\nTo any sort of a solution\nOr maybe even not even a compromise and the death penalty will be one of those there's still be unless it's a Supreme Court ruling there will be hold outs and there will be other states that will say no thank you\nAnd there's pressure to do that too because of mistakes that have been made and I get it\nAbsolutely\nIn the meantime you might not get what's happening with the market and I've got a bunch of emails from people talking about that asking me what's going on with the market he's talking about about finances and I of course I'm not\nA mistress of stocks and would not offer free advice I have tried to school myself in it yes we've had people on but I Do know this and I made some calls today and we talked about the interest rates that's part of what you're saying\nSo the Dow down again

three minutes away and then\nEventually it's held in ... minutes away changes let's talk about potential changes in the U.S Senate and here to help us understand what's going on and maybe offer some guidance is none other than Greg Jerome he is our expert for all things related to Washington and\nSpecifically the political environment weeks for me to lecture you bet\nA Greg hero national political environment for Democrats that's in your lead\nSentence and is this going to mean more to the U.S Senate will the Democrats be able to add to their numbers in the Senate or will the Republicans hang on an even maybe add a seat\nWell the national political environment favors Democrats but we're looking at two different maps for the house and the Senate and then the Senate um where people come up every six years the Democrats have to defend twenty six of the thirty five Senate seats and that's\nThe worst that's the most lopsided map for a party since before World War two you have ten states that Trump one where the Democrats are defending ... seats\nFive of them Trump won by more than Eighteen percentage points and those are the big five and I'm watching in three weeks all five of those races run a knife edge that allows for a range of possibilities that Democrats have a slim chance at winning control the Senate it's more likely than not that they will not win the majority\nBut I'm right now they're just trying to hold as many of those Trump states as they can to avoid a Republicans opening things up a bit from going from fifty one to maybe fifty two or fifty three seats and as we've seen in the Senate\nYou know even fifty one forty nine majority of Republicans have been able to get through a judge Kavanaugh and also a lot of their other judicial picks\nGreg or on election night what states what what are the states that I should be looking at it we should be focused on his at Florida Arizona is in the Missouri Montana\nAll the above sir and I'd say if you look at the poll closing times of Florida is one of the early states to close and I've already looking ahead to that of Florida you've got Bill Nelson the incumbent democratic senator against Rick Scott\nThe outgoing governor who wants to move to the Senate or Rick Scott just reported yesterday he has spent thirty nine million dollars of his own money\nOn the Senate election and that race is on a knife says well I think that's going to be one of the closest one to watch\nThe big five that I mentioned that the the big Trump states where Democrats are defending ... seats\nAt West Virginia and North Dakota Montana Indiana and Missouri so I'll be looking at those five is well there'll be keeping a quote one eye on New Jersey where I think you know Bob and then there's this labor to put that seat away because of some of his ethical baggage but I'm the Democratic pro democratic environment I think should be able to carry him over the finish line\nThat Texas Texas is getting a lot of attention\nIt really is um because Beto O'Rourke has raised a ton of money to go up against Ted Cruz who's defending his seat of a lot of that money is you know in opposition to cruise ran for president of course\nAnd twenty sixteen Beto O'Rourke raise more than thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter this year and astounding some\nA Texas has not elected a Democrat state wide since Nineteen Ninety four show there was a very high floor for better work I could see him getting to at least forty six forty seven percent of the vote but getting the fifty percent plus one in ... against Ted Cruz in Texas will be hard\nJust quickly uh Greg why are there are so many different polls wise is such a sort of margin of error for all the Senate races\n[noise] uh well just because um it it's very hard to pull the electorate accurately um you know you can make twenty twenty five thousand calls and still only get like five or five hundred and fifty people who were going to respond until you're either going to vote margins of error you've got you know plus\nWho were going to respond until you're either going to vote margins of error you've got you know plus four plus five percent so if\nCandidate aged forty two percent and there's a five percent margin of error that person can be thirty seven percent or could be forty seven percent it's just getting very hard it's much harder now to pull the electorate accurately and we're still trying to figure out it's very hard for pollsters to figure out what the composition of the electorate is going to beep\nGreg ... thanks very much for being with us yeah I Love the heat you know she knows it if I could just rolls off his\nKind of does it all day answers is really beneficial would I find fascinating is almost a ghost each and every one of his his whatever politics a wrong we were the evening\nOf November two thousand sixty\nAnd just lingers through this whole thing over the next three weeks Greg ... note\nI don't know I uh I'm I'm just going to take exception that but that's another story um you know there's a special election in Minnesota right you've got a special election in Mississippi and then there's a greater mentioned you've got the New Jersey West Virginia\nAnd also ...

got an app and you know maybe you're buying cars where your drivers or release financing them but it's not like you know your money's tied up in it it really is about connecting\nA drivers and their passengers I mean it's really when it comes down to and ah it's it's worked out for them in a whole lot of places around the world still losing\nMoney though well there is the areas that have our style any big tech companies ... and the post crisis era say you go to talk about other companies sort of like that Tesla Tesla shares are out of a more than five percent because the mosque\nA he has a settlement with the SEC was approved by a judge everything's fine now well at least do cattle and when I\nGot about a hundred thousand cars that was a big miles yeah for them um can we talk about one stock that's not doing so well today we talked about it in the last hour Granger\nYeah that wouldn't get your attention for a couple of reasons one is just the nature of his business I mean they're distributing goods to industrial companies so you can kind of look at them as a barometer of what's happening in the industrial economy more broadly\nThan the other thing is that their results were received in the same way that a competitor of fast and all their results were received last week not well in short a third quarter sales and income and the grains are coming up short of estimates\nAnd you put that together you've got the worst performing stock in the U.S and people have hundreds and it's not even close it's down twelve percent second biggest drop this plaque rock which we talking about earlier lower by four and a half percent and\nBrexit makes an appearance in the earnings statement for Granger they claim that a hundred and forty million dollars non cash impairment charges related to a business in the United kingdom and they say ...\nFlex slower growth outlook as well as structural issues including prolonged Brexit uncertainty ...\nThen no doubt we'll have a whole lot of other companies over the next six months or so is the deadline or comes up for rent negotiation of the Brexit than it is not looking good for a whole lot of companies who are doing business in the u._k. at this point\nSince you mentioned black rock I Do think it's interesting to note that they had a big institutional investors outflow even if they continue to see a retail investors put money into the firm's find really also one of the most interesting things to me is sort of ...\n\nLevel but I think in order to get that you'd have to have the economy and inflation accelerate from current level so I'm so like like ... mentioned um you know we were basically on a steady state at the moment so as long as growth remains um you know at at reasonable but not\nA but not very fast levels like we have now um I think that that you'll see a stabilization and rates and an interest rates maybe even go back down a little bit as people think okay well you know this has been the longest a recovery that we've had in the post war period at some point we're going to have a recession whether that's\nThree years four years five years down the road so longer term interest rates can go down even with short term it straight still going up a little bit as the fed keeps on hiking interest rate\nLike the kind of question I'm Wondering where the deficit the federal deficit\nFits into that 'cause yesterday we got data that the deep end more than seven hundred billion dollars on the edge to the most since two thousand twelve\nShould mean the U.S is getting riskier I and that basically you know should rise if investors are becoming bond vigilantes again when is that going to be a narrative or is that all the ah thinking\nYeah well so there's two things one as a percentage of GDP the deficit is is big but not unprecedented Lee big um and secondly that says you know what's very unusual about this particular\nTime of of deficits is that where we have increasing deficits when growth is relatively good so the question is you know do we actually need those kinds of deficit so don't look at the seven hundred billion dollar number we want to look at that as a share of ... of gross domestic product writes them as a share of\nThe size of the economy and that is yes big but it's not again not not really big um the ... there is at a time when you probably have that tipping point but we don't have it yet you know one of the advantages of the U.S has that say a lot of other countries like\nUm like Argentina did or or Russia did or a back you know Fifteen Twenty years ago\nWe don't have any debt that's a or significant amounts of debt that are in other currencies so we control um you know the currency that our debts and so so the real credit risk of\nUm of the U.S is very very low the question is do we have to inflate our way out of that debt by having very loose a monetary policy for example in order to make sure that our our debt doesn't uh is is at some point paid back in and we're not at that tipping point yet I don't think but you\nKnow there is a a time whether that's um you know another uh but you know another fifty or sixty percent of of debt to GDP ratio going up the where maybe that would happen but I I think for now people aren't so worried about that yeah there's other countries that have for higher debt to GDP than we do\nAnd um and and they still have interest rates that haven't blown out yet you know I'm thinking about countries like Japan um although you could argue you know their their central bank is buying a lot of their dead as well and and and their own version of quantitative easing\nWell I'm Glad you mentioned the central bank because this comes at a time when there's quantitative tightening in the United states because of the Federal Reserve allowing their assets to roll lost their balance sheet there a likelihood that there will\nBe a lack of demand and a\nSort of just a huge sue nominee of supply when the government tries to refinance its debt and corporations tried to refinance their debt at higher rates\nSo so you know that's something that comes up quite a lot and and quite frankly the uh the the amount of the Federal Reserve office actually tiny compared to the deficit so it's really the deficit that that is and so anyone who is worried about\nBond vigilantes coming back should not worried about the fed runoff they should really worry about the about the size of the overall deficits of the physical side of things that Congress controls not the monetary side of things that I think people should should worry about\n'em you know one of the one of the things about about the fed runoff too is that it actually gets smaller next year so um we we peek in terms of\nHow much runoff as per quarter in the second quarter of twenty Nineteen and then it goes down quite a lot from them just because the Federal Reserve doesn't have\nAs many treasury securities maturing starting in the middle of next year I'm into twenty twenty and twenty Twenty one so we actually are closer to the peak of of that runoff now um than we are later and and that comes at a time that maybe you wind up having somewhat better deficits\nAs well particularly if the economy is able to kind of keep up the current pace of a of growth\nAs well particularly if the economy is able to kind of keep up

and we should also mention\nSaudi Arabia continuing to be among the most red story or on the Bloomberg Terminal Mike ... going to pay a visit there must be Graham center Lindsey Graham taking to the Senate floor to talk about that a lot of a lot left to come on that story as well what\nKind of waiting to kind of get the story straight out of Saudi Arabia and the ultimately what are they will kind of a position and what\nThe long term impact is on us Saudi relations importantly so All right so let's get into what has been happening in the market back home or at the home office\nWe have ... days will send a as well as ... she of course is senior U.S economists there at Bloomberg economics so they want to start with you I as we mentioned big run up in stocks what's the big driver here for you\nWell you've already mentioned the earnings out of Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and they've been well received and you can point to a whole lot of other earnings reports\nThat I've also gotten a positive response adobe notably the design software company which has had its results out late yesterday best performer and he has to be five hundred up more than eight percent of the moment\nYou look at the United health group for just us help ensure not only in the U.S with David also one of the Dow Jones industrial average that stocks up ... percent after their results then you can find enough examples like that I mean even Johnson Johnson\nWhich has gained a little bit more than one percent or after their third quarter figures be to ask what's the deal is we surveyed Bloomberg's a and they also raise their forecast for the year or just as by the way you might have helped it so\nI put it all together there are enough positive or to give people a some confidence that companies are going to be OK\nRight they just take a look at the S. and P. five hundred main industry group someone I find fascinating that even though you heard from Goldman Morgan Stanley and we're feeling pretty good about these results financials are not one of your top performers overall they're they're almost three from the bottom\nAre still gaining up about one point three percent and the overall session all the industry groups are all gaining but information technology health care consumer discretionary and communication services does your top performers in the market today\nAnd it is widespread I mean I'm just like in the S. and P. at this moment four hundred and Seventy gainers thirty two\nAre losers three and change the change in the last couple of hours of training here we'll keep an eye on that of course so you into a come on and hear what does this say to you from an economic perspective any data out there that maybe people are trading on as well\nI mean we got some data and it was actually a relatively positive so we heard uh on some news on industrial production which was a positive the bet expectations and\nAh we saw that it does slightly slightly more than expected\nAnd that basically it confirms that up production is ramping up a little bit stronger or in the second half of the year then we saw in the first half this is consistent with what we've seen a I assume service on manufacturing and uh the sector\nA lotta stuff very positive or actually in the second half of the year\nAnd it can I just jumped to ... job openings and it will be in favor of Janet Yellen that report came in really strong\nYes a e especially in terms of job openings so that is uh to me the forward looking in Decatur basically telling us that we can achieve further jobs growth that is not going to slow down and uh we potentially going to see more wage growth as well so\nYou know there are so many more job openings that uh um companies can find a people for so that\nIs going to drive a the strengthened the labor market down going forward\nFor sure the Atlanta what's the next big data point coming up in your mind\nAre we going to have fun some housing data and died that we expect to be weak housing starts in that existing home sales and that basically all housing data have been a pretty weak recently we don't see any exceptions or for that to that\nGoing forward but I think that we are going to watch the influence the minutes tomorrow that's going to be right\nBut there are guys thank you so much tables and stock set it up on the news and you initially of our senior U.S economist at Burger King economic second or a Bloomberg interactive brokers to you\nCan I just I just took a look at Netflix it's up to point nine percent and today in session it's up something like I think Seventy eight percent so far this year we're going to get Netflix earnings after the clothes and I think these technology names we have to watch very closely to see if they live up to the expectations I have that\nI've already been price in their share price of whether or not we see the market\nCan you need them of higher and if I'm remembering correctly that place was one of the big disappointments last quarter ... subscriber I think number was a bit of a disappointment and the stock took a ... right so we'll be on will be looking at that when a very closely and again you know at the Wilson mentioned this is not just the banks is is a lot of earnings growth\nOf the worst thing that seems to be a fueling this market now to undo the bite of the day\nGoes by the day uh let's get to the market spite of the day one number that tells us to a lot today's number Jason Seventy four percent I did not cheat ahead on this so tell me what it is according to account Thames national study nearly three quarters of American workers Seventy four percent to the exact show up to work\nMe where I've done that were both like yeah recent Rand Corp report found that us workers lack of sleep costs the nation's economy as much as four hundred eleven billion dollars a year\nI mean our economy I mean I Know I Know that you have your uh\nEleven billion dollars a year\nYeah I mean our economy I mean I Know I Know that you have your ah your weight what I Would file that under my a day or that I mean I Am a little surprise it's only Seventy four percent just looking around the newsroom on any\nGiven morning going to say I was just talking about actually in the make up for him this morning about everybody yawning when we were all a tired buttons but listen felt flocks to come from the sooner than you think some it we are going to talk about the impact we're going to talk about China's increasingly larger wrong when it comes to the global Tech University so lots of great ... great All right well\nLet's check in on the latest one of the national headlines for that we go back to the eleventh real news room in New York and Bob ...\nOkay going to let you guys shut a wake up a little bit tricky to state run news agency says the Saudi console to assemble has left for Saudi Arabia hours after turkey said his official residents will be searched in connection with the Saudi writers disappearance earlier Turkish forensic teams finished a search of the Saudi constantly\nHistorically financial institutions have under it and small businesses manually so that's one of the problems we saw\nWe also work on helping small businesses get paid that's a major challenge for small businesses is well taken typically forty five days to get paid and not accentuate the cash flow problems so these are some of the things we're trying to do to change the game when it comes to money for small businesses\nSo run the U.S take us inside if there is such a thing as a typical small business because obviously this business gives you sort of an intimate look literally their book yeah yeah um how are they feeling these days what are the trends you're seeing sort of bubble up through your day\nIt is such a challenge to be a small business will see small businesses who need a little bit of extra capital to put inventory on their truck you know I I I saw one of our customers as an eight track\nA supplier and they said I don't have enough inventory to finish my service called so I'll go and understand the issue and then you've got to come back a week later once you've ordered the inventory they need working capital the power that or they've got\nThree extra cars they do they find two cars they're ready to work on them but they don't have someone to hire that they can bring on board to do that small businesses are losing opportunities because they don't have the cash flow to do it even though there's very positive opportunities that can take on and when the bubble it up to the statistics more than fifty percent of small businesses failing their five first five years we are\nHyper focused on changing that for small businesses by allowing the ecosystem torque Saddam tipping the odds and their favorite as you know a lot of small business owners probably shouldn't own a small business that they're not necessarily the right people to run you know what I'm saying that there's a lot of small small businesses start and maybe there's somebody in there that shouldn't be doing that so\nHow old are you as someone who wants to make sure you get your money back yeah ultimately pick and choose who should get this money and we get a loan\nYeah it's a great question it's super important for us to strengthen small businesses and so we're very\nFocused on making sure the capitals helps them grow president hurt them because they take on more than they can borrow\nAnd unlike many of these alternative lenders and the space we look at the full cash flow of a small business when we make alone decision and or uniquely positioned to do that because we don't just see the revenue but we see the expense side of the equation very unique we run payroll for wanting twelve employees in the country we see that data we see all the payment state of we process away any slowdown\nYou how it was just getting started on payroll data for one and twelve one in twelve employees across the country while we also got this process\nNearly fifty billion dollars of payments transactions for small businesses through our credit card and they see age business\nWe have all that data that flows through us um we also power contractor payments we've got T. sheets or T shirts integration so we can understand how much time\nOn small businesses are booking and what's happening there all of this allows us to better understand cash flow him so I don't need economists I don't need to pound the economy doing yeah I ... I don't mind that's a great question and it also helps us\nMake sure that we understand the trends in the economy so that we're careful with our overall alone portfolio we can understand in a micro economy like construction and to accept\nWhat type of new jobs are being booked what does the pricing looked like in that economy into what does it tell ya so what are they\nThat net net I Want to pay off [laughter] so hard things are looking good you know the better better than a year ago the same a little bit weaker I ... it depends on the market and the geo um but the overall are seeing continued positive trends disarmament so\nGoing back to this idea of lending in where the money is coming from you you you have such an interesting career looking into it a little bit you were an investment banker you worked at Google before now I'm used to go on your current assignment\nHow has the lending landscape changed here you are in a panel about this earlier what did you learn and what what did you sort of contribute to the group\nHow civil lending landscape is changing and an incredible way it's I I'm just personally so excited about what we're going to be able to do\nWith lending possibilities to change the game for small businesses if we can get some of the capital they need we can put money into the hands of small businesses that ultimately generate jobs in this economy and imagine the GDP and productivity growth that we can see\nThat's the only possible by data innovation when you have data innovation people who otherwise you still look non credit worthy send them in the ... you can understand the true credit worthiness of a small business I Believe we are going to change the game around\nStand the true credit worthiness of a small business I Believe we are going to change the game around small businesses being under served in the capital perspective\nAnd is that new money going to come from existing financial institutions as a kid I come from non banks where's that going to come from\nA lot of the capital's that's powering some of this lending will come from financial institutions because they see it as a very ... positive way to engage their identifying lenders like what books who are in empowered and positions to\nUnderwrite and assess credit and a very differentiated way and um they feel good about to go the ultimate loan performance\nAnd so they see it as a positive investment and it continued way to power the economy so you'll see interesting partnerships between financial institutions and new emerging players in the bay already seeing them right I mean I kind of yeah\nGreat stuff Rania sue cars thank you so much joins your vice president business leader for quick book payments and capital here with us at the Bloomberg sooner than you think conference in Brooklyn down a lot more to\nCome and talk more about ten tech and a\nCouple of the other guests as well off are going to get to have been going in just a moment you are listening to market on the radio [noise]\nAnd then I'll for him so that was ... because so many go after it doesn't seem to think after a short term getting caught up with the crowd\nManagers at the gym took a long term [noise]\nUncovering opportunities for al ... which is really going to proceed risk\nHas power to authorize to talk to global lesson monitor\nPartner with the just the global investment management business and then she'll financially\nLearned more in the G.

interesting Washington Post ABC News poll Republicans now a head and the key battleground house districts now this is the most important\nPart of the poll if you look at it they quote ABC News is recline truck a look at the current generic ballot polling which favors the Democrats but\nYou know what it always favors the Democrats although we have other polls that have shown that that that gap has narrowed significantly what he's pointing out is the core concerns now with three weeks to go three weeks from tonight you're going to get the results\nIs that Democrats worry a whole lot that mid term enthusiasm is going to wind up wasted in places they don't need it\nIn other words but they're really finding is let me translate that oh they have the generic ballot wrapped up in New York Chicago\nNew Jersey transit and you know San Francisco everywhere in between they have a wrapped up in Los Angeles probably but\nNot in red state America and what this analysis shows is inside the districts that will result in the the balance of power in the house of representatives put it another way that will decide if Nancy Pelosi once again gets the gamble and become speaker\nIt is a dead

only way these Democrats can win is to lie to you not talk about what they really want to do New York times is now concerned that Democrats could be in for disappointment on November ... column their headline what\nSir and the Democrats could be in for disappointment on November ... column their headline what could ruin a big blue wave two prominent New York Times columnist some of the problem with these words quote Donald Trump seems to have faded Hispanics voter wrath\nWhatever what does that mean anyway you mean the fact that we have the lowest level of unemployment for Hispanic Americans and African Americans and women in the workforce look I I get some people don't like Donald Trump style\nBut\nYou can't argue with the results and you can't argue with the fact that he made promises and he's\nKept the kind of refreshing anyway goes on to point out Hispanic voters despite all Trump's border cruel disease well\nHe's always talked about some people that can make crimes and I've been down to the border more than anybody in the New York times and I've seen it myself maybe they should go to the drug warehouses in should ride horse back\nTerrain vehicles and helicopters boats\nLike I haven't stand by the border walls and and you know look at the tunnels that have been built and look at the drug trafficking in the human trafficking that has occurred and maybe sit

doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they supported and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist and say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nYet it's working everyone you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe horrible correct I mean we want to go down there to try to tick down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nKnow Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald

had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nYep this is a one size fits non model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to ensure everything but

All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care of local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear is a calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now if we wait for
