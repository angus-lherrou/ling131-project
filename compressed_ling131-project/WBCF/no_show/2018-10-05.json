thinking at that rate than I don't think she was credible but not only has this hurt judge Kavanaugh which by the way he's going to be okay if you hear what his little girl said about praying for that why did you get a lot of that and as a family man and no one can debate that\nAnd also but this is hurt true right back then and that it's obvious that Democrats don't care\nBut I'm Kerry and everybody thought you know I was thinking the other day when the me too and then that will now have thought in Hollywood if they put on a rollback grass and walk around and make me feel better and

happened to them I thought it could have been a positive for our society\nBut as I Believe you even brought up yesterday\n... has been hijacked by political side of the aisle mhm and it no longer is about being sympathetic caring or or\nEmpathetic to people who have gone through this now it's about who's going to be on the court who's going to be the president who's going to be the senator who's going to be a member of Congress and it's ... the entire thing I think next is is that on right when she looks at Hollywood she wonders how is that how was Hollywood of his so called me too movement\nHow is that there for me and I don't think that it is are we going to get a break your when we come back it's going to be Zachary ... though he is of course from Cuba's reform dot org it's a great website great young reporters who were getting the job done with a legacy media kid to be more\nA you know extremely extremely unprofessional\nAnd the ... ... that's a a practice known as dogs to many people watching don't understand what that means\nSo she publicly on this three thousand word blog instead of responding to you directly as a journalist 'cause that's who you are I'm and she also she let people do who you are where you are hard to get a hold of you and basically we're sticking to the left on you\nAbsolutely and I I think Eric Trump had a perfect response to it as a ... and a power player in this town he\nSaid look this isn't so much above you know a person issued isn't Democrats or Republicans this is a lady that inciting violence\nAmong sitting members of our Congress I think no matter if you're a liberal no matter if you're a socialist what have you I think you know condemn violence is something that we should all doing stand together and doing Eric Trump said it that he said look you know I'm a big Georgetown supporter but this clearly cross the line um many people are speaking out many people are frustrated and I do hope that Georgetown takes the correct actions\n... true so he's a great correspondent over from a reform dot org I'm this Christine ... professor of fair thing is is not so good at what Twitter didn't destructive but I'm One would expect to Georgetown would say look\nShe's somebody who is in our employees were going to reassess because there is obviously something going on we don't support what you said we do it but they didn't say anything about what they actually said was and of course we were wrong they said well that was your private thoughts on her personal Twitter has nothing to do with us\nAbsolutely yeah that's exactly what she said and then also today a you know fresh off the news press if you will in the newsroom campus for form you know we got wind of a student that basically came out and said look I was in her class had to drop is due to the rapid political bias and her spouting off\nUm and yet Georgetown has yet to respond or you know to those specific allegations you know I I Believe this to be a complete abuse of power um you know we have a professor that is you know\nAnd be using her power and and saying you know you have to believe what I Believe I Believe is extremely uncalled for and we would think that at a top tier research style institutions like Georgetown\nWe wouldn't see some type of you know curtailing on this or or some type of you know making what is right here because they do pay so much in tuition right uh so so I find that to be extremely unfortunate for the students do attend the university I Do what I did have a friend that attend to Georgetown University and they were telling me\nThat they just want to stay away they just want to stay away and I I Do I Do I Do a you know myself after being attacked I'm you know and Abigail quite viciously or you know I I see it firsthand\nIt's always that group or true so we're talking about Christine fair she's a professor at Georgetown University and I use the word professor loosely um of course exactly would rip corresponded from campus reform Cuba's reform dot org go there every morning I'm long let's get into a Twitter did now because Jack ... recently Jack Dorsey went recently to Congress any claim that\nYou're really left but we purposely or unbiased on the actual platform that isn't true I'm I'm shuttle banned all the time I I can tell when I Am because one person sees is you know tweet that I put out where I Know fifty nine thousand people would love to read it\nSo that's ... that's not true they have immunity from liability um does Facebook in those Twitter because they promised to be unbiased\nAnd they're not when it came to Christine fair she was verified I'm ... and nothing happened to her for the first twenty four forty eight hours than people like you and me Eric Trump and others are started re tweeting and asking jak directly what are you doing\nAbout this this person who is actually say I'm inciting violence kill these people feed their genitals to swine what are you doing about it so then they suspended or account but they let her back on very soon thereafter without the verification badge that Mrs maybe it'd again and now from what I can tell she's back up\nIs that really is that the long and short of a Twitter get now you know ...\nA Twitter a to cancer and formed a a ... actually told campus art form that they made an initial mistake on first suspending her on Twitter we haven't yet figured out why she was I was I was sick\nOr we haven't exactly figured out why she was suspended the second time\nUm but in my opinion look this is clear incitement to violence I think it's quite hypocritical and it's almost a double standard that Twitter has found that to to unfortunate look\nA you know ideas you know if we're all about free speech let's make it their free speech let's not make it you know this type of pick and choose what what what we politically you know identify with Twitter I think Twitter has a long road ahead of them out to correct these mistakes and I hope that they do\nWith the ... river a correspondent over from campus reform done or let's go to University of Texas at Austin just up the road from where I'm sitting right now where I guess the the young Republicans dared say support Kavanaugh confirmed Kavanaugh will how did the left students respond to that\nWell they were simply having a peaceful protest a you know supporting that of judge Brett Kavanaugh I think\nYou know this would be a mere gathering of people it's changing ideas but no the Latin get again turns the violence which we think too often as a correspondent here in Washington DC you know I see people marching you know and and and protesting which is important but yet it turned violent left is always trying to violence or attacking people an airport and I think\nI Know actually that a majority of the uh I'm Mitch McConnell said it perfectly said it perfectly on for like things that we are not going to stand down to this left this idea of violence that are caused that attacking people in restaurant runs at attacking people airport this\nAct on college campuses is exactly where this type of idea of attacking people up a violent protests as coming from and where they weren't ...\nThe idea of attacking people of violent protests has come from\nAnd and my ... and they weren't physically assaulting these these students I was watching that they were taking their science ripping them\nTheir work in front of them are sold them in getting their faces a screening of been pointing them back to that okay that's not what the First Amendment was made for the whole right do you know to protest and bring redress or the government doesn't have to do what you're going to somebody on campus was a a varying opinion from yours in shutting 'em down ... what it's about these campuses it'd be out front teaching that\nIt was absolutely horrible you saw these left wing agitator really really really it in the face of this ... supporters and and rip up their sized quake viciously and uh you know I I was just shock as I watched the video to be quite honest because here we had these groups of students that were threatening or ideas and these ideas that\nAre commonplace the United states believe it or not you know people support Brett Kavanaugh people support the concert or I guess Joe ... believes then um you know I may not think that you know some some of these allegations but what it doesn't mean is that sexual assault isn't important but I think that there is this the misconstrued ID on college campuses\nBurger more college campus to due process what ... and left wing agitator have set on college campuses in light of this back how long thing is\nTo process what is that now that doesn't matter right and I think we see that not only on college campuses but we get in our country Russia and then thrown out the window\nOr be Cory Booker actually said that I got to go back a great reporting by you and buy a

the international court of justice or the world court it's sometimes called I ordered the United states to do is actually a company United States is perfectly willing to do is make exemptions to allow humanitarian trade with Iran I think what the administration really objects to though\nIs the very idea the ice sheet Jay has asserted jurisdiction in this issue because for the United states did it on national security and it's not really subject of the world courts jurisdiction\nAnd it's a matter of national sovereignty also uh having them into the er and as you said America does give humanitarian exemptions and has always provided for it but you know when they talk about the aircraft parts being coming under the guise of of being humanitarian\nKnow when they talk about the aircraft parts being coming on to disguise of of being humanitarian need when we know that the Iranians civilian aircraft are being employed in Syria\nAnd deployed caring troops and doing other things so it is not a non military issue when they talk about the um ... certainly in the military equipment and we know the mullahs sell a lot of that medicine so so in fact the United states cases\nIs a lot stronger this this Nineteen fifty five treaty which nobody seemed to remember was there [noise] um ... ending it seems to be a justified moods\nWhere I think it is a justified move you know that the fact is and the irony here is that again the United states actually could interpret the world court's decision as a win because what Iran had asked a world court to do is basically to declare all us sanctions can be somehow illegal\nI'm John ... with Malcolm hold on\nSyria and Russia are separate story from Iran and Russia because of the ongoing conflict because of the promises made and question is blood and treasure let them or putting his invested the ideal of boats and\nRight now I'm Latimer potent is quoted most recently in the times of Israel saying all foreign troops should

we'll issue as three hundred system\nTo the Syrians who had managed to shoot down a Russian craft\nFollowing er during an Israeli airstrike or how do you measure the relationship between Damascus in the Kremlin right now is it one of confidence is it one of just trust is there a betrayal of foot good evening to bars\nAre gaming and thanks for having me on I think this episode of certainly deeply embarrassing or you have a quieter side regime shooting gotten one of your own aircraft with weapons that you're at fault them in a long while ago after hundreds\nUm how ... systems that really can't tell friend her phone I've kind of one on one of one of the problems there uh for the for the Russians are but it's deeply embarrassing and I think they use this as an excuse\nI'm to transfer the three hundreds to the Syrians would resort video of earlier this week um they've been wanting to do is is that we've twenty Thirteen earlier or they had to deal with Israelis back twenty Thirteen to not do it I'm obviously that this\nUh this incident with the excuse that they've been looking forward to quickly go ahead and reform the transfer\nOf we have very complicated situation this is a one reflection of it when you have the as three hundreds are coming in addition to the U.S two hundred but we have an ally turkey a NATO member who's getting the S. four hundred supposedly the most advanced the system is are the\nThe Chinese and they've been threats by the U.S about sanctions on ... uh\nUh the countering America's adversaries who sanctions act and other um measured ... what do you see the the us reaction now both regarding turkey and trying to do they go to the mat on it and how will it affect Turkey's relationship\nIt within the Russian orbit [noise]\nYou know what he saw Robert ... a prominent ministry should issue the sanctions the cats are related sanctions against Chinese\nOr one Chinese agency and the Chinese individuals that executive director of that agent right for their purchase of four hundred and thirty five fighter jets off I think that's certainly a shock to the Chinese are to the Turks\nUm there was this report today that the Indonesian or putting on hold a their purchase of the court thirty fire fighter jets because of their concern about sanctions\nSo I'll go should be taking this seriously that um you know the conversation has worn turkey that this could lead to sanctions or not they follow through on sanctions and kind of set the precedent what China\nUm you know the the the lights she'll be flashing red or for turkey whether their stock um you know I I that's a mistake I think they go they go through it\nBut as far as I'm I Want to press you on how the Russians deal with the Syrians in Damascus Russian military intelligence is excellent Russian networks are first grade throughout the middle east always have been there are a lot of Russians have married Syrian so there's a ... there's a comfort here working and xeroxing them\nDo the Russians trust I saw it in any fashion and have they totally penetrated his organization did they know everything all the time\nBut I have one person making decisions I don't know if they know everything all the time but they've got no alternative they have this kind of multigenerational forty nine year basing deal\nAlternative they have this kind of multigenerational forty nine year basing deal with Assad regime for uh the base in Tartus a naval base it on the air base I mean um and so they they're holding on and there's no there's no\nPolitical alternative for them they don't they don't see anybody else that can basically guarantee 'em their equities and in Syria so I'm not sure it's a matter of crossing or not but it's that's the kind of\n[noise] they've got the ... out now in the locked and Assad is\nThe partner for that I'm and I'm not sure how how ... ... there's not there's no other way for them to move\nAnd as far as it relates to the United states or Israel or are there key players and the reason that just kind of the reality now and we do the Russians are dealing with Assad as they are and Israelis are kind of dealing with dealing with Assad regime in a very I'm kind of realistic way and\nI'm targeting what they need to target and family Iranians\nUm so I think it's a it's more of the actions than than any trust to having maybe here when they get the three hundred set aside it's more about making sure that\nThe kind of the troops that Assad has are are really lax uh don't end up sitting up there on aircraft as we saw when it's incident that they have something that's more advanced now that can actually tell Russian aircraft from\nIsraeli aircraft are from you know other aircraft\nYou know we have another front where we're seeing a an ally a moving closer to Russia in some regards to visit a president Sisi of Egypt and to Russia I think when the seventeenth to Sochi do\nYou see this as a an opportunity for Russia to establish another base now that they've consolidated the hold in Syria a naval air force base they long sought based in Syria in in each of what what else could be on the agenda for them\nSo they've had I mean it's I think it's just it's a fascinating trip on the seventeenth I mean is it an Egypt CCAs previously visitor Russia's while they're signed kind of a slew of military and economic cooperation deals but on the military side we haven't seen\nSome of the kind of basic things come to fruition yet and so that's that's in my mind is that the key thing on the agenda the Soviets had some basis in ... in western um\n[noise] and western Egypt do they want to revive somebody's airbases to they want to revive some of the naval kind of access they had um military and they were actually had to Egypt and a friend parts there so I think that's what's really interesting here to watch\nThat describes coming about fairly quickly and again bills on already military and economic ideals have made in the past couple of years so it's it's it it should be concerning for the U.S where you have [noise]\nAsia for traditional ally I'm continuing to gotta get get zero with the Russians and part of that is when we're not engaging with them you know we still I'm Still waiting for a in a bathroom Egypt to be named uh the state department or David Shenk or that sort of affects different areas\nStill has not been

reason to\nTo believers and know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is uh Robert ... who's this a PHD used on all these peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how\nGoogle could swing an election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got\nThe Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nThey actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson a we highlight in the film you say a psychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google a from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has a millions of people that have downloaded his content so\nIt does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to\nDecide their whim or how they are going to control what you see what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well\nI mean that's what they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that the example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the point being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that ... did\nThat is particularly interesting we'd go through this in the in the film a is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a blind way um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period and then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some\nWere blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google in every single search position of the\nTop ten search results is the result favored Hillary Clinton\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump in the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a\nSomewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't help to results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially settling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science is essentially political\nBut he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that ran\nUndecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election\nThat when they start sort of going to the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for a and looking at the search results to we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer\nAt the one eight six six five oh Jim boat one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the

the same company that they got rid of expectation that was if you didn't want to use silk will result he wanted other resolved and\nI don't understand that Google suppress if they make them the pets I click or what happened to it and I use that that though [noise]\nYeah no that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple\nA favor by doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that because\nThey want the information and the data that comes through search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right start page a\nIs a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being president\nI think that is that is going to change eventually biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck a while ago duck Joe Joe is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google but the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you are manipulate you in a way commercial gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that they\nWhich is the Microsoft product which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century and twenty six teams truck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped\nBeing so hostile to Google and a lot of people believe that there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's\nPart of a challenge there really aren't that many

murdered\nA district Nancy I'm going to give you an open question I Know you've never seen this before but what is distinctive about them never seen this before\n[laughter] wow what is it to me I think it's really the first of all the fact that because the stakes are so high here and you're talking about\nThe balance of the Supreme Court itself possibly for a generation um that or a lot of senators on both sides um the way that they had all of that when it comes to have an awkward lousy for ever mirror that delegation\nHas so much to do with where they stand on that larger question at the direction of the court\nThat it it is very difficult for them to the um is that if that provided by the other side the often feel like\nYou are talking to people who are operating opposite to entirely different\nSet of that for example you know when they all came out of the closed door briefing yesterday look at the FBI report for the very first time Republican came out that no proper eighty information in there I'm not saying that wedding them at eight\nBrett Kavanaugh and Democrats came out that absolutely not there was a lot that that report was troubling and the port that'll probably but the fact that more people were in interviews um so that's one thing is just to be you know the fact that because the issue of the Supreme Court is so broad that has made that\nSexual allegations of sexual assault allegation and the whole incident more broad as well and then beyond that that's how ... everyone has come up here in anger towards protesters\nOver each other anger towards your order that is really in Tempe right have you put your foot in the elevator door\n[laughter] to talk to them I have not I mean here's the thing the thing now\nYou know there are a lot of people looking for their elevator moment after what happened last week there were ... you know that certainly thought hey that worked with Jeff Flake I Wonder how you know we're thinking on President it clashes between protesters and then let me\nBring man whoa whoa what are what are the rules or if there are any of decorum in terms of access to senators and so on in light of the fact that I've been looking at videos as you mentioned of various senators coming out\nOf that secure room indeed are I think that I had an urban end as he made some comments that were videotaped and then they're all the videos of salads and some protesters what what are the rules about all this\nWell then it off that sell the not the capital itself Senate office buildings are completely open to the public\nSo you are allowed to come in and were allowed as long as you are you know a Capitol police rules you're allowed then you're allowed to approach senators are obviously there are questions about personal faith and back then that kind of thing\nBut you're allowed to walk the halls and Nebraska Senate building right now and I'm looking down on a big on ship\n'em protesters who are getting ready to have that it again\nAgain today um what is what really been different is the fact that Republican senators and dealer are now trailed by these protesters almost every weird though those protesters are interrupting interviews they are getting in that senator said that even if they're talking to reporters\nEnter you they are getting in the senators the reporters and tempers are flaring and a patient is clearly when does it end\nYou know I I\nDon't know I think everyone realizes that the term friday when I voted now and and you know\nNot to say that it's not working out one of the last remaining undecided Republicans sat down in her yesterday with more than a hundred Alaska when in\nA who wanted to talk about sexual assault and why she shit though if you're an editor the fact that more than a hundred women are willing to fire from Alaska it you know it's going to in potentially insulin did they\nWant to thank you very much a hope you're safe there Nancy quarter sized sounds strange to be

E. shares on September twenty eighth let's bring in car or get on a here I who covers all things economic\nAnd other for us here at lower economic safety so much Carl I'd like to get your take on the jobs report in particular the fact that people seem to believe that it will not stop the fat from going ahead and ... and hiking rates that kind of keeps them on the path to\nShore so well you know the payroll change was a hundred and thirty four thousand which was a way towards the low end of estimates so we were below consensus but not not that far below consensus and so the the first question in your mind is how much was this distorted by Hurricane Florence ... obviously in periods where we have\nMajor disruptions like winter storms and hurricanes or you can see a show up in the data out last year during a hurricane the um\nUh the the three hurricanes Harvey Harvey Irma that yeah that's right after you enter a sister Lisa that'd be a between Harvey Irma\nOut we did see payrolls turn into actually the negative territory and so well you know we we look for clues in the details of the report and so for instance we look at people who didn't show up for work\nFor weather related reasons\nUh that was six times seven times larger than what normally occurs in September we looked at people who work shorter hours are due to bad weather or that was about six times out what's usual in September and so that tells you severe weather absolutely\nHad an impact on both hiring and hours worked in this report I and so we have to take that into consideration and when we do then that payroll changes not nearly as troubling as it might appear at first glance\nCar record on uh what's the what the take away from this report piece of the GDP Growth what does that tell you about where we're headed\nSo again to get a a reading or an estimate on what GDP Growth should be out we look at aggregate hours worked or total hours worked in the month and that number was up just one tenth of a percent in the months so that ... what what do you get would imply\nA week's GDP number select number all the reasons I just suggested a ... hour and I'm going to Helmand that tells you that's misleading and so it means it's going to be a stronger number or the egg ours would otherwise suggests\nThat my teams that to wait but we're looking at my side risks for that are coming off of a four percent four handle on GDP and cute too I think there's probably some upside risk to our two point eight per so what are you talking about maybe three percent it I think low three percent territory is a reasonable estimate okay\nDave come out and come in here because one thing that I'm watching as interest rates rise and as we get this good economic data that indicates that all systems are go full steam ahead unemployment is the lowest dies cents\nForty eight years ago and wondering which sectors get hit hardest as a result of rising borrowing costs you mentioned at home a home builders were

two thousand six team\nYeah I mean you can point to a number of areas in the market who sort of obvious candidates and you know you think about the high dividend kind of stocks because they're an alternative to bonds for investors\nLooking for income a utility spent the category real estate a phone companies which are now part of this broader communication services index so you know there are bits and pieces the more we have that sort of\nRelatively direct connection and then you look at the companies you see they borrow a lot of money so uh they certainly are affected by what happens in terms of their borrowing costs to\nCarl Lee suggesting conclusion here uh again at the hurricane should have caused higher than expected average hourly earnings construction utility workers that was all inflated even that didn't distorts the overall number we're still not seeing wage pressure\nIt was all inflated even that didn't distort the overall number we're still not seeing wage pressures with the unemployment rate now at three point seven percent that's impressive it's more a Goldilocks\nThank you go online they really be the story what's going on in the stock market as much as anything a Goldilocks scenario pointing out yeah I like to go the law says can keep calm and carry on cheap or I see T shirts in your future\nAnd I asked you a little bit about what's going on with the U.S dollar\nI think the dollar story is really going to be tied in to the fact that the fed is going to continue plodding along towards ah interest rate normalization and policy normalization and general might do the balance sheet unwind\nWhere are we in terms or two percent inflation goal right now we're right at it in terms of underlying inflation so that's good but also where we in terms of the labor market in in growth\nCompared to what we think of as a sustainable pace of growth and can we you know we just want to keep the economy strong keep inflation around two percent and then get that nice balance it a chair Powell talked about in Jackson Hole speech\nHow far above two percent would you be willing to let me see inflation running for how long\nDo I think in thinking about you know inflation me somewhat above or below or target first of all a place in does move around for various reasons and so it doesn't bother me if it's a little bit ... below or a little bit above so when you ask the question if it were a few tens above a on a twelve months\nA change that wouldn't be worrisome we really need to think about it is that the economy and the medium term over the next few years\nIn a sustainable a sustainable path and our inflation Francine around two percent of the\nBest thing that we have on our side here as it should expectations really well anchored around the two percent of the public expects that I think that's why I'm you know the full of ... seems to be pretty flat and what we need to do it just keep inflation on average around the two percent rate to ... to\nReinforce the creative inflation at our two percent go\nSort of conventional wisdom in the markets that expansion is don't die of old age kills them by tightening rates too far and restricting credit that the plot suggests that the fed is going to tighten up above the collective view of we're neutral might me why shouldn't get investors worry that you'll go too far this time\nWell obviously we we know the history we uh we are in my view I don't want to\nChoke off this expansion that says getting to be it's getting closer to the long expansion in us history\nAnd I would love to to reach that market set a new record for that so when you look at the projections that my colleagues and I when we wrote them down there they do to people who I mean we do see the country moving somewhat slightly above\nThe neutral but not enough that I think it's really about tight a monetary policy that would\nA risk or choking off for selling the expansion I think we're getting trying to get this\nBalance right keeping the expansion going by making sure it's on a sustainable\nSome members of the committee argue that in order to achieve that it would be good to stop and look around at some point take a pause a what do you think of that idea\nWell you know we I my own view here is that we're continuously updating our views of the economy watching the data you know honestly several times a day looking at financial market conditions global conditions I don't ever take a pause in my monitoring them and all of the economy I don't really think em\nMonetary policy is taking a pause I Do think that we're going to\nObviously reassess where the economy is\nReevaluate what the right path for policy is over the next few years but that's not going to be an some time uh Tate table or some being around neutral it just about trying to get this right jets interviews in line with how the uh the date or evolving and where we see the economy going\n... chose the committee sort of coalesced around for ... this year and the expectation in the markets as you'll do something in December but there's a significant range of outcomes for two thousand Nineteen the median is three but there's an equal number of people who were at two and at for\nI think that the if you look at the center of the range of my colleagues projections from a recent economic projections I've I think these are really pretty reasonable views of where the economies are likely to go anywhere policy needs to go in terms of sustaining this expansion or you know we asked me where it's\nWhere it's a federal funds rate going to be at the end of next year\nIt's independent the data things can happen between now and then that will affect our decisions and so you know I Can't really make a prediction is one uh one answer better than the other because it really will depend the data the economy\nContinues on the path that it's on I think a gradual path rate increases for the next year or so is is the right of course for us to keep US Economy going and keep in place in your two percent\nOf the people who were his money betting on what you're going to do have basically felt that you've been too optimistic about how strongly economy is going to be and how low inflation is going to remain for quite some time are they wrong are are they going to have to come up to your point\nI think all over the learning from the data and learning you know\nAre they going to have to come up to your vehicle\nI think all of our to learning from the data and learning you know and talking to each other and there are definitely times who are there is being a separation of use of a lot of market that the economists horses you know maybe my own view but\nHonestly it's loud about being right or wrong it's telling that you know it's really about seeing how the data ball and which view gets more support from the evidence right now I think the evidence is pretty convincing we have a very strong economy right now with solid growth I expect we'll GDP Growth to be ... or maybe a little bit about three percent this year and\nIt fell two and a half percent next year that's a that's a very good economy I'm and I'm\nVery confident and that's what's going to look like with it and we're going to all learn from the data how situation you know the global economy of all how financial markets conditions evolve and revise or who\nDo you expect much faster inflation next year given a local strengthen the economy and now rising oil prices [noise] well I don't really worry\nAbout underline inflation of course have to apply to inflation number will move around with the energy prices that that just a kind of a math in a way if you think about it that way um\nBut I don't see any clear assigned to either from wage growth or other science from a you know the date or the surveys of strong and fight upward inflationary pressure so I expect inflation they pick up you know at ten thirty two over the next year or two but not really much more of your\nBoston fed colleague Eric Rosen grand said this week companies in his district are finding it really easy to raise prices something we haven't seen in years what about companies in the second district\nWhere you are hearing or something like that too now again if you go back to the last few years and our conversations and you know others I mean we've all heard the opposite inflation is running below two percent a lot of businesses that to\nTo uh to me and to others [noise] it's really hard to raise prices it's just such a low inflation environment so we've seen inflation move up to two percent we've also seen during more\nKind of ease um stories about it a little bit easier Paso cost increases\nAgain that's why I'm going to be watching the data really closely and again and do you continue these conversations with business and community leaders to hear what they're experiencing in what they're doing a in a situation are they\nTelling you as they told the president ... that they can use the tariffs to raise prices as an excuse\nWell I you know when you talk to business people they have their own experiences in their own a kind of a actions that they're doing so\nDefinitely there's some talk about well in this environment where my costs are going to have a lot of it I really have no choice but to raise prices and and I guess telling their customers or or other and so that's why they're doing it probably we help people understand why it's happening here a little bit of\nThe epilepsy spent quite a bit of time at its last couple of

course comes after the FBI report on what happened in some of the sexual allegations against a judge Kavanaugh and that report has been in a skiff it's a a secure location where there's only one copy and the hundred senators go down and rotate\nTo review it so that they can understand exactly what the FBI sound or did not find\nYes uh if you know that if any of those uh\nSenators vote yet Horton a Senator Jeff flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine as well as\nLisa Murkowski of Alaska and undecided Democrat Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia or any of those vote yes then judged as confirmation would\nAlmost be a short because the Republicans are Rudy fifty one forty nine advantage in the U.S Senate\nPoint especially because you know the vice president can cast the deciding vote so I so far it seems like if you're going to predict it for example it looks like the odds of judge Kavanaugh being confined to the Supreme Court\nAppear to be rising especially since the FBI or did not seem to find any huge red flag says she\nSaid that uh as far as this forty six page we're concerned it was delivered to the capital a at two thirty in\nSo then and also it we should note that there are a is transcripts from some of the tips are so they came into the FBI that were not followed up on in in a secure location\nOr is that senators here if you're a mom and actually it sort of interesting that the Democrats have an hour or a certain time period and then Republicans have a certain period and it's sort of they can't they're not in the same time but you're saying\nYeah in fact there was a leave of Sen Menendez of New Jersey coming out and taking the survey on quite a different view of the information in the report to learn to Utah Senator Orrin\nHatch is war and the justification for only having one copy port for all one hundred senators to review that they really want to prevent leaks they don't want this getting out are specially if there are sensitive pieces in their ah regarding people that they interviewed and aspects of their life\nAnd so that is why they only have one copy of their report for one hundred senators and they have somebody reading part out to them and they're keeping their phones outside out which is part of the skiff protocol\nLet's get some insight now from Kevin Whitelaw who's been following this very closely for us here at a Bloomberg he of course a covers the Supreme Court and all things on Capitol Hill Kevin can you just give us a sense of what people are expecting right now with respect to whether judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nI think this this is one of those rare Senate votes where the outcome actually does remain and genuine suspense um usually by this point everyone knows exactly how this is going to play out\nBut at this point um we just had a a one Republican cast a no vote 'em too on on the procedural a on this procedural vote that's Lisa Murkowski of Alaska she has been known to have some concerns about judge Kavanaugh even before\nThe sexual assault allegations came forward or so on but still a bit of a surprise to see her voting no and we're um we're expecting Susan Collins of Maine and other Republican well she is going to vote yes on the procedural motion so she's not going to announce her ... ah she's going to the\nSpecial report critical cat on all vote the time for decisions is at hand\nAs Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court is about to get its first vote by the full Senate a critical procedural vote allowing for a final vote which would likely come late tomorrow\nWe're voting schedule to get underway and a few moments for senators have not announced how they will vote on the nomination itself yes or no they are Republicans Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake plus Democrat Joe mansion\nCollins has just announced she will vote yes and this preliminary vote but we'll stayed here intentions for the final vote at three o'clock eastern

and and visitors have access was security concerns for for for senators\nKevin Whitelaw thank you so much for joining us we'll let you go and not continue to cover this insurance are quite a day on Capitol Hill Kevin Whitelaw it covers Congress for us for Bloomberg News let's bring in now Kimberly Robin ... Bloomberg Law to get some more perspective on the legal implications of judge Kavanaugh rising to the Supreme Court\nKimberly it does seem like the more likely path at this point is that judge Kavanaugh will become a member of the Supreme Court how will that affect the makeup and some of the rulings that we can expect from the highest court in the United states\nWell judge Kavanaugh is replacing Justice Kennedy who was known as a swing justice but Justice Kennedy was a deeply conservative justice so we're likely to continue to see a very conservative rulings coming out of the court\nAnd ...

very low\nIn Washington the big number three point seven percent unemployment number getting Republicans very excited a forty eight year low but you know you look a little deeper and as you mentioned Carl there's some other numbers to look at what does this mean for the Federal Reserve particularly as they are looking at interest rates for sure\nWhat does this mean for the Federal Reserve particularly as they\nAre looking at interest rates shore certainly so to put that into context that the unemployment rate is the lowest since the Vietnam War draft was in effect so that tells you how tight labor conditions are that being said\nSome four percent unemployment doesn't mean what it used to win so it doesn't give you the same bang for your buck on a on wage pressures and whatnot and so the fed is having a ... suspending\nA doubt and taking a creative look at a ... economic dynamics and saying well we're we're still not seeing wage pressures and its do until those wage pressure show up\nMaybe there is indeed more slack on the economy it's a little Bob it's a little bit like fishing right you cast your mate out and just keep rolling until you\nInto until you feel the nibble on the line that we're not feeling the nibble on the line and that tells us there is more room for this economy to run a and a more slack in the labor market then that unemployment rate would have you believe at face value\nOkay so this is radio so our listeners can see me scratching my head right now\nBut I Can't picture you what that fishing draw on globally though is is good news bad news this is great news for the economy it tells us the you know we keep calling the Goldilocks not too hot not too cold or the Goldilocks a characteristics of the economy continue we're growing above trend\nThat should be generating more inflation pressure but we're not seeing that much which gives the fed the luxury to just very gradually start normalize interest rates they will do I didn't get goldie it any better than us right after I Can't get better than\nFour percent growth and cute to ah unemployment rate or below four percent wage pressures above the inflation rate things look good\nAnd what about the impact of Hurricane Florence we didn't really see that much of an impact but what do you think well when we look\nReally carefully into the details of the report we can see signs of hurricane impact here so that that that payroll change a hundred and thirty four thousand which is a soft relative to what we've been seeing for most of this year about ... on further inspection we could see things like\nHow workers who had a job but didn't show up for a job due to bad weather that number was seven times bigger than it usually is in the month of September ... if we look at workers who worked reduced hours\nDue to bad weather so schools canceled that kind of thing that was about six times bigger than what the average is forest September so there was some minor signs of Hurricane Florence extracting a toll on\nPayroll gains hours worked and maybe even somewhat distorting those a a average hourly earnings numbers but we look at construction average hourly earnings and utility worker average hourly earnings they were much higher than the recent trend in higher than average as well so that you know\nTaking that out right we know that hurricane inflated those components then it's an even more benign labor inflation trend\nAnd what some businesses would call another potential hurricane the president trade policies that we've seen any impact on on the numbers from the trade policies that's an\nExcellent question and we're seeing very little impact if we look at first of all hiring in the factory sector a running at the fastest pace over the last twelve months since basically Nineteen Ninety eight so we're not seeing it there or maybe that's being glossed over by things like tax policy and whatnot\nSo when we look at something called the payroll diffusion index which measures the breadth of games and the economy is still running at a very healthy level that could be one place where we would start to see strains even if\nThe other parts of the economy were being lost over by tax policy a and other types of things that might be stimulating the economy we're just not seeing it it's very hard to see evidence of the trade war or in these type of statistics and in fact it's hard to see it in the GDP statistics\nAnd at the end of the day when we calculate the cost of the terrorist measures put into place it's simply is not big

up noticeably\nWell the unemployment rate continues to fall so at some point you start to get traction on that if we zoomed back and look at that average hourly earnings trend or you didn't labor

expected tomorrow Saturday she is expected to I had to the floor and make a speech at three PM Wall Street time I'm whether she will vote for the confirmation ultimately and there are I guess there is still some question out their case and in theory that this is my ...\nAnd the other person that we have not heard definitively from of course is Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia right a Democrat we have heard of a tough reelection that's absolutely right we have heard from Senator Lisa Murkowski she has said she will vote no a Senator Jeff flake who of course\nKicked off the additional week of the FBI investigation has said he will vote yes so it is narrowing down to really these two senators it's pretty clear at least from what we know at the moment right where everyone else will be it's really down to they used to\nAnd to be fair to his kind of I think where we all thought it would come down to is these two female senators at Republican senators or not to be a ignored of course tests in the news ticket at deja vu all over again in masks tweets getting into trouble I got the share price down so we're going to look into that it's about a fascinating\nThere that he you know came out with a um [noise]\nUh and I'm not the first to say that it's a rather Trump in tech a dig at the SEC so we'll see what the implications of that may be also it was jobs day yeah the market certainly reacting to that so let's start there are with the boys who have come into the studio Joe was until markets editor\nFor Bloomberg co host of what you missed coming up a poor PM and Dave Wilson stocks editor art shirt and stock guru throughout this show he's here with us as well in our Bloomberg interactive brokers studio so devoted to start with you or the market reaction to the jobs report what did you make of it\nWell in a sense it's kind of odd what's going on here and I say that because you you seem bond yields move up in response to the reports the bigger the interest rate sensitive areas the stock market would take it hit as well not so in fact a ... way the opposite you look at the moment\nOut of eleven main industry groups in the U.S in the five hundred two of them are higher utilities in real estate and you talk about areas affected by a but cost the money\nThey certainly qualify whether you think about you know the the cost of borrowing for these companies or the fact that their shares get bought for their dividends and that's a competition with bonds however you want to look at it you know it's interesting to see these exceptions is like\nIf anything people maybe looking for some safety or in relative terms you know safer in type and that was or something it's it's kinda hard to figure out especially when you see financial stocks which presumably stand to benefit from Irish taking a hit here they're lower along with a whole lot of other things technology shares in particular\nKept wise and they'll come on and that's about what do you how do you explain this\nDon't know I hadn't even quite noticed that until they pointed that out now I'm like that's pretty straight cap today markets in my mind is on my mind's on the jobs report still missing some interesting stuff the other thing that I think it was important our colleague blue collar has a really good story\nReports still missing some interesting stuff the other thing that I think it was important our colleague blue collar has a really good story about the VIX futures a curve in ...\nThe last time they did this so typically VIX futures during contained go further out futures are higher up people want to pay for protection further out occasionally converge were the short term futures are higher which means people feel short term risk they're not concerned about the long term\nBut they see short term volatility the last time we got this was in February the next day we got a four point one per cent decline we also saw this right before August the sell off in August two thousand Fifteen\nSo this has this is a harbinger\nOr in the past it's been a harbinger of an even further sell off to come but a short term sell it sounds like ... yeah and that's really the key here and it's really been the key for the last few years the market has been characterized by these very intense short term sell off\nThey don't really amount to much grand scheme of things\nWhen you take a look at the next day she had just had to laugh yeah this is a chart he sees the spike bounces back down and then it's kind of doesn't do anything and then ... and and it comes back to\nI think we tend to associate big sell us with either bear market or\nDownturns in the economy stuff like that but I think the story the last few years and you get these real like intense bouts of selling remember that day to day I was like a thousand point yes by nine thirty five\nBut nothing really happened after that there was no slowdown there was no ... selling was shot in February we saw it on August twenty Fifteen\nAnd so you have to wonder to what extent are we in another one of those piers it's not that big yet to just to be clear and I'm not predicting anything but where\nWe're going to get this you know obvious volatility scare and people are getting nervous today and you see it but where maybe we'll look on on this a few months they are just another sort of stone in the life\nOf course the flip side of the argument could be that given that we've seen so many of those sort of one day or two day wonders it's really easy to dismiss anything from here as just another example of that\nMickey perhaps harder to figure out wedding do you have a real turn and of course the difference this time around is that we're seeing some of the highest the treasury yields in years so\nIt's not quite the same as what we've seen before so you have to wonder whether this is something that turns into a bigger moves jury's still very much out on\nAnd that is true I mean we're seeing them pretty the the pickup in treasury yields yeah throughout all of this LA pretty striking ... up to three point to for\nHighest in a quite a long time yeah that the whole yields question because that certainly has the potential to really go through the market in a way that will will will have to defeat reckoning with somebody may third\nYeah and I think I got ... and I just like that idea is not the relevant rate increases like I think yeah mark folks are saying okay it's going to happen yeah it does it\nSeem like there's any ambiguity about it now barring some sort of major change in the narrative and I'm ... like today's jobs report was good yeah and the wages so you know not much going on there but we got a really nice up or vision to the past two months and the headline this month was probably distorted somewhat by whether\nThere's just no evidence of any sort of deceleration or meaningful change and the underlying for ... years to come and there you go\nJob wise and told markets editor for Bloomberg host of what'd you miss coming up at four day well since ... you'll be back with this for your heart and stock of the day\nAll right if it lasts get a check on the national news headline for that sort of a man and he's in our newsroom right here in New York City hip hop\nSo you see the report like this put yourself in the position of the fed and are they saying are good we're doing a good job they're sort of patting each other in the back they were reading this re we made the right signals\nBecause a lot of what we and I asked that because a lot of what we've been talking about is is sort of new fed this Powell fed and the way\nHe is communicating and the rest of as communicating they feel pretty good about where they are even\nI think the person who's sitting back and congratulating herself was probably Janet Yellen's yeah she got a gun was good um she set up the framework that worked really well and now Mr Powell is come in eastern framework out I think that she's in the hot seat because interest there on the edge they don't know which way is going to tell us right now\nThe they're the ones to be careful that are over shoot right that could essentially turn the push the economy interest that and they've abandoned\nThe guidance yeah right so we're no longer on auto pilot now what what I take this as the fed wants to listen to the market out while you get rid of our star and all this talk about where's the neutral rate because that was really a method\n... talking so much about our ... our star has been like a drinking game this way or may not have to raise the how much we've heard it\nWill because once you start to lift off a zero and we definitively moved away from zero at this point then you're you're looking for some kind of barriers are those the whole speech from Jackson Hole was all about well how do we get oriented that all the\nThey'll sales workers out there but for warehouse workers most of

about these charges a from a doctor for it and talked about also the presumption of innocence and to her these words so the dueling qualifications with regard to considering the way the justice was created\nAnd the way he was treated by the progress has by the Democrats really pushed\nOver the edge because they did not consider fairness and ignores the presumption of innocence also saying that she felt doctor for and was Hughes progressive by the Democrats are and abused just as much as justice Kavanaugh which really turned off\nTo what they were trying to do now to the extent that other swing voters and America have similar thought process\nPossibly this conclusion they may come to\nThat these methods of the progressives\nNot various things like that they overplay their hand\nAnd
