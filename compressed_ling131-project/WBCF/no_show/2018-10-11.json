id law\nAnd carry your correct me if I'm wrong but a voter ID laws very simply say two votes you have to have your state issued a photo ID with you\nAnd correct\n... it's just that simple right I mean you go there here's my state issued id now those who said no no this isn't fair said that it's a poll tax a poll tax means to vote you have to go and pay something\nAnd I'm like well how can that be a whole tax because if I didn't otherwise have an ID and you're forcing me to get an id is not free to get an id therefore you're charging me money\nFor the right to vote now I Do understand that

left today the left is actually trying to say that this president President Trump is trying to do away with coverage for pre existing conditions it's lie\nIt's not true it's absolutely based in nothing but but false foods are so we break that down weeks but we're also talking about his take on the whole cabinet debacle and the hearings that will just ridiculous made the Senate look a bunch of idiots we're talking about the vet and about ten minutes earlier with Ron Johnson but sent me a message on Facebook\nAnd then you'll get ... messages to get updates on who's going to be on the show what topics we have and so on ah like when I have a ... will tell you I've got a pack started coming up a lot of people do want to know when it's going to happen a lot of people except for Kerry lucky girl does not want to live in Hawaii by the way is um he's saying do the crazy or the Mazie\nParity mhm now yeah I agree with that as soon as I deal with the way was not crazy about Patsy Cline was crazy by she'll agreed\nAnd it was actually a normal sparkly that did that I think she low of course the lead singer for knows Berkeley so I'm so maybe\nI mean I I got a couple of options now maybe to the local news though to be forty five to staying alive that's not going to happen so we've done the more you're also the website click on Instagram a lot of people a lot of positive comments on how you look on the camera today\nReally that they think you look great go ... go hang in line of course there's always one person over on Facebook Celeste\nIt's up there on her campaign on her thank you so I appreciate that and my answer to ... days never\nShed listen ever going to happen that's not going to helping ... so we've got that for you which is always nice as well plus or as\nYou there I Lived tweet during the program or if you're wondering what what good is it easier to give it to get a hold of you you either you know send me an email or I live to eat during the program and I\nI tend to be on the twitters if I'm awake I'm On the twitters but somebody has to be on the Twitter all tend to see it um if if I Know the Instagram is where you go over you go see the picture of carrion polo and the new studio carry an eye yesterday or carry and meet yesterday on the screen shot for Newsmax had a big hurdle allowed me to post a picture in real pain and he asked her to live in the\nReal thing then eleven thirty like midnight was like two thirty in the morning [laughter] bringing a now\nSo yeah go check that out all the social media is right there plus a you'll see the news stories that we're talking about right in the right hand side as well Joe ... let me go to the phone lines on a voter ID A lot of people have a lot to say about it it's going to be a Sheryl in line to show what's going on\nRight now I've been here every day like how in from or I Do not blame you\nThank you and me when I got my registration and all we had to lay out nail it in a hard hat and your name\nAnd years and I think Boehner id number yeah and you can get pretty dang a newer assigns you create a card game and then you can vote right now or in it and it's all by mail\nYou can only vote by mail and Oregon yeah you don't actually go to you don't go to a polling place all no come on man it's All right now well then how do you know who's who\nExactly\nSo ... and by the way the registration card and it ended up itself wasn't enough either if I lose my wife's if I lose my wallet and my voter registration card is in there somebody finds might well it takes me voter registration card goes in votes in my name and doesn't have to show ID\nThey get to do that and then I Would be disenfranchised that's why the photo ID actually protects all Americans so that their franchise isn't taken away\nExactly\nSo who's smart idea was to have vote by mail only\n[noise] I have no I yeah that they changed it over and they send your ballot in the mail you mark hey you know for the sign an envelope that get in another and lo and man right in\nMy ... you're not going to start a new segment am I gonna hold on a second one that was a matter of the Oregon [noise]\nWe can do that\nAnd really there and a lot in Oregon that it's wrong\nAnd what's interesting is there were a lot of great Americans like you that live there and then you have Portland\nYou know what I mean it's it's like the state would be read except you got a couple of concentrations of people who just don't seem to get the American way and then the rest of you have to suffer we love being on an Oregon but we've got like five stations in Oregon now and we love that open line now and it it eight nine four one pegs\nEditing nine for one Seventy four seven let me quickly grab Lisa in Tennessee leads to make it fast for me what's happening\n[noise] okay well um [noise] well they were saying that it was unfair to um blacks and Hispanics and the elderly and young people\nTo have to have 'em and I pay you know stay I Do right but the reason why they were selling artist to correct that they couldn't afford it but they also didn't have transportation to get there to get the id right\nSo I don't understand how that's an argument because if they don't have transportation to go and get the I Do how do they have transportation to go and vote\nBut it's a great question and also to add on top of that I'm Sorry but old people young people Hispanics blacks in American Indians are all able to go and buy Sudafed you've got to show a photo ID to do that open a checking account have to have photo ID to do that\nI mean you can't you can't go and watch it Eric Holder speak without showing photo ID so that the whole thing is a ruse\nAnd what bothers me the most out of all of it is that so many drones and lemmings on the left will sit back and allow the leadership of that move\nOf the progressive left in this country to actually look at them and say you're black so you're stupid you're Hispanic so you're stupid you're you're an American Indian so you're stupid you're younger you are oh so you're stupid and you can't go and get an ID I happen to believe and in my way of thinking is metal you're smart enough\nBut you're way way smarter than your own parties do you credit for\nWell well they're an angry mob and ... they they've been they've had this primal screams cents a day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you know I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking out an enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous insecure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery shop from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican race in Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garrett would correct you supported the president as it all Republicans\nAnd has been all Americans because their paychecks are bigger and\nAnd this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually help the people of the major amount of people that were paying that find that tax to be an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it\nA of a political thing just strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you like health care plan and keep your families who have their previous juice probably five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live a year\nOr they're they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule where President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right and they're saying that were to take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if\nWe reinstate these things the strain of sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that\nAllow companies to offer me no ability okay so so you give people a greater assurances four point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plans because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get in there just estimates in Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mama care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year you know they could get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half\nOr two a quarter of the current level so in other words you're paying for a thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guarantee remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if you can afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the advance premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums costs because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you said a second ago and you said it kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something just really reiterate that former senator if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of coverage for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do through regulation right so the ... the protection terms or preexisting conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the hot and care exchanges\nWe're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford\nHealth insurance for once okay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a\nTotally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term ... ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because we're on day one single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base is that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects our pre existing condition which no one wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that uh they think they can win the election but no I mean there are long term goal obviously is Bernie\n... Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts a tour his single payer government run bureaucratic system that will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars\nEverybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double the still wouldn't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down the number thirty two trillion they realize how much money that as a Senator Ron Johnson a one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime my friend\nOne last question I run a an eyebrow always read the access of the time and You're welcome anytime my friend\nWhen it comes to the mid term you just mentioned it briefly I feel strongly that ... percent stay with you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly\nBut the houses are starting to look like it's up for grabs where this blue wave was being talked about for six months do you think that the moves by Avon audience Feinstein and and uh and Cory Booker Spartacus and all these people in that process\nWhen you think that's going to motivate conservatives and Republicans to get up off their hands and go and vote November\nI sure hope so I don't I don't know ... what else what else can Democrats show the American public ... to just create the discussed again if you're not disgusted by their despicable ... behavior got help ya\nYeah so I'm I'm with you and I think that it's going to be probably I'm a hearing people saying red dawn\nOn on on November a sex I'm not really sure what's gonna happen other than people need to go and vote or else it surely will be some sort of a strange blue wave with impeachment talking all this other garbage Ron picks a million for the time I always appreciate the knowledge and thank you so much for really straightening out with this individual health or this individual's choice and health care really is\nBecause the lies are going to continue for the next month and you know the\nAverage ... ... we're back after this one to Joe packed shows the writer\n[noise] you know\n[noise]\n\nThe Brett Kavanaugh matter I think this case proves the media is out of control\nIt used to be a man was innocent until proven guilty but if you watch MSNBC and CNN they see it the other way if you're a conservative like Brett Kavanaugh is well you're guilty there\nIs an answer better media honest media there's a channel I've been watching and that I'm On Monday through friday it's called Newsmax TV and its America's real conservative news channel I like it\nYou should check out Newsmax TV as well you get great guest people like Bill O'Reilly Mike Reagan Pat Buchanan so many others you can find Newsmax TV right now on direct TV channel three forty nine dish to sixteen Uber's twelve twenty and file six Fifteen\nThat's direct TV channel three forty nine dish to sixteen Uber's twelve twenty and file six Fifteen I Love being on Newsmax TV every day and I love watching it when I'm not on and remember to go to your smartphone store download the free Newsmax TV app\nAnd watch them anytime anywhere in the world news max TV is real news for real people like you and me\nIf you're like my family you've got a ton of videotapes I mean VHS you might have film even photos laying around you have looked at him and years and they're just be generating they're not going to get any better or nicer or better quality sitting around in a dusty boxer on a shelf somewhere wanna get I'm taking care of put together on modern media\nFrom a great company called legacy box I Love legacy box I've dealt with them they are incredible when it comes to saving the history of your family for years to come you can get those photos that film that VHS all that stuff\nPut right on a thumb drive you could have it on the cloud you can have it all put on a DVD and then you'll have it to save forever and to share with your family for good sounds amazing doesn't it it is and you got a great deal because you listen to my program legacy boxes off remind listeners\nForty percent off at legacy box dot com slash bags that's legacy box dot com slash P.

aggression\nThe ... the ambition\nAnd the confusion of the People's Republic of China we inherited it from the twentieth century it is part of the business model of the earth right now but it is demonstrating either instability or irregularity you get to take your choice\nOr hostility we can't tell garden a very good even too good evening John in these last week's garden we have looked at the Decatur incident a on a Sunday Morning eight thirty am local time spradley islands the Decatur on all the ... class destroy which means it's one of the biggest warships in the solar system\nWas challenged by a\nPR ... navy version of the same thing a missile destroyer within forty five yards they Decatur was on a freedom of navigation act the\nP L A navy uh was warning the Decatur to back off these are Chinese territory that as a false statement and that incident\nAttracted us Gordon because it seemed out of step with the conversations about North Korea with the conversations about tariffs but at the time you looked upon it as a sign that the standing committee and the president for life Xi Jinping\nSign that the standing committee and the president for life changing paying had made a decision what kind of decision\nWill certainly the Chinese have decided to try to push the U.S out of the south China Sea and its other peripheral waters\nAnd over a course of years we've seen some very dangerous encounters not only with warships but also with the navy and air force planes\nIn international airspace or the Decatur incident was unusually aggressive because of the Chinese warship across the bow of the Decatur and came within forty five yards when it did so that's just seconds away from a collision that could have been catastrophe we\nWelcome to voices who help us will help us understand these unusual occurrences that are happening in China and in Hong Kong and on the high seas South China sea first of all returning to us after some weeks mock\nClifford is here in Studio ... he's the former editor in chief of the south China Morning post and a resident in Hong Kong since Nineteen Ninety to mark a very good evening to you and thank you for joining us thank you John nice to be back in addition we ... we are very lucky to have the candidates for a masters in higher education see Holden Kim\nHe's at the University of Rochester to join us tonight to talk about\nMm irregularities on college campuses Gordon is that a general enough way to put\nA certain way we're going to look at an incident that occurred in March and talk a little bit about Chinese influence on American campuses and what American administrators are doing is they react to what they perceived to be um Beijing's wishes\n\n[noise]\n\nUm ... my colleague and co host and we are very pleased in the studio to have with us mark Clifford the former editor of the south China Morning post is a resident of Hong Kong and he's traveled here to New York to sit with us\nThe horn Kim has a master's candidate in the program for higher education at the University of Rochester but also as an observer of influenced by the Chinese authorities and their Kendrick of Cain Gordon\nSay you're a graduate student University of Rochester in March you we're organizing an event on campus who is the events for\nSo the event was pretty much for everybody and the university was an open event where everyone can come without paying a fee and it was meant to sort of um\n[noise] spread this idea of dialogue on campus and dialogue with whom I mean who who are the people are going to be at the event so I'm as I said before it it it although was open for everybody I wanted to use I wanted to purposely use the Tibetan issue as an example\nBecause of the fact that the Tibetan issue mainly focuses on on having dialogue with those that do you tend to disagree with\nAnd so I'm by by ... by sending that issue and talking about it on campus we want to give everybody a chance to participate to not get to know about the issue and of course being on a college campus we do have a lot of an international Chinese students\nSo want to give them a choice I'd give them an opportunity also too\nYou know I could get to know the Tibetan issue I'm ...\nAnd if I did some issue to bet I'm Beijing believes is a part of the People's Republic of China it sits in the south western portion\nVery strategic because many of the world's a river start their high ground 'em and Tibetans they don't necessarily agree that they're part of the People's Republic some of them do but some of them want independence\nActs at least since two thousand they the Chinese authorities have used brutality against the people of Tibet we have reports of internal migration forced internal migration ethnic cleansing can be called\nNot only in Tibet but in large cities at the edges of the Tibetan Plateau that's what you were introducing people to the facts that we have about uh the persecution\nHis holiness the Dalai Lama the spiritual leader the Tibetans um has taken the position that he doesn't want independence that Tibet should be autonomous\nAnd who's complained of what he's called and what many people agree is cultural genocide the purposeful attempt by Beijing to eliminate Tibetan Buddhism to eliminate Tibetan the density 'em to take over the lands of Tibet so this is controversial with regard to both\nIran and American campus what happened well\nYou know it's it's not a I I think it's more it's bigger than being an American campus at this point because you know my primary goal was to live out this whole principle that you know we can talk about any issues as a student and we can\nCome come to come to the mutual ground and and just simply\nYou can come come to\nCome to the mutual ground and and just simply and simply sit down and agree to disagree or or to agree to agree\nAnd et cetera et cetera um I purposely use the Tibetan issue in order to give a an opportunity for every student to observe it and make an opinion of their own and then have a dialogue amongst themselves there by living out the principles of\nWhat it needs to being at a at a college campus especially in the United states of America\nAnd in March you would actually organized this event it was advertised it was actually the University of Florida's new about it because of course ... it was taking place on the campus of the University of Rochester and you had a very good central location on campus who did what happened immediately before the vote\nSo I'm up until I guess a day before the event I'm even a even a little bit before that everything was going as planned um I was told that the hosting student organization I'm even had a meeting about the event and they've even decided not only to host even for me but\nTo help me register for the event I I I went through every every guideline that their advice or had told me to follow and\nSuddenly um my ... so my event was set on the thirty first of march and undone night or the twenty ninth\nMy a friend of mine actually sends me a screen shot of an email that they receive from the Chinese student association saying that um you know apparently the Chinese students association has had received ... concerns\nFrom uh some of the members of the Chinese a international student community and that are about my event going on on campus and they will and it said on the email that they will let the ... in both the university and the student administration or know about this\nNow a few friends of mine actually called me that night and asked me you know a we're actually fearful that your event might be canceled or something worse might happen and I told them you know what\nYou know this is the United states what could happen you know it's I I'm entitled to my free speech as a scholar um ... it just says they're they're free to they're free to go and complain and\nI don't see anything wrong with it so what happened to come that morning I get an email from the advice or the advice the same advice or who helped me all throughout that month to register and to reserve or that event\nOn campus um sent me an email saying that the hosting sooner organization all of a sudden with drew their support for this event withdrew the sponsorship for this event and henceforth um this event was cancelled and on at the end of the email she even noted that um she suggested that\nI I I moved to serve on from to an off campus location\nSo basically the University of Rochester decides to um cancel your event and Turks you off campus well\nI I don't know exactly what happened I don't know why I don't know why she decided to um you know take that step but uh to to the eyes of many people might look that way they've got and has a lot of smoke around it here right [laughter]\nRight but all I can say is that you know um I it was a big disappointment and also at the same time I was not only disgusted by what had happened but you know I I just I it it's it's I was so upset\nNot because of the fact that my event was cancelled but because of the fact that we I personally felt that we were somehow compromising our values as Americans as as as people who are living on this land um\nTo to practice this idea this this this right of free speech who think that was so\nHard ... Gordon who made the phone call um soon who made before we made the phone call I mean what do you think who made the phone call somebody made a phone call who watch it I I can only I can only guess at\nThis point I'm up maybe maybe it was maybe it was some very upset student on campus maybe it was a ... the Chinese government maybe it was a some donor who who might have not been happy that this kind of\nA while and let's go let's go to mark Clifford for the answer what Senate come to\nWell we were talking before about um the the scholar Perry links 'em a suggestion that the Chinese government is a bit like an anaconda in a chandelier at a party everybody's enjoying his party in the ballroom\nDrinking champagne eating canopies whatever\nThe snake doesn't have to do very very much everybody knows it's there it reaches out every once in awhile often quite randomly you can't figure out why the snake does what it does but it keeps everybody in mine John there's another part to the story um we don't have time in this segment but we've got to get back to it because\nThis is an issue of what an campus administration is doing and what have tried to do to cover its tracks\nGordon Chang's database mark Clifford is a former editor of the south China Morning post and we thank you very careful very careful scholar say when Kim to tell the story of the University of Rochester yes there are other explanations but I think everybody just heard it not only in the United states but around the world\nThe anaconda I'm John ...

Indian needs investment I'm at with hoping to get quite a bit of an back from Japan and and it's got some investment from Japan\nBut Modi in order to be reelected and you know there are elections coming up in the spring of twenty Nineteen really needs to deliver on things like John ... that sounds familiar I'm so he needs investment and\nThe goal with the Chinese engagement was to try to get the financial engagement with that\nMeans engagement was to try to get the financial engagement with that the political or security compromise that sometimes goes with dealing with China\nAnd clearly has ... gotten the investment he's expected from the United states\nIt has been as a as easy as it could have been on but I think there have been um problems on both sides there are a lot of\nUm vested interest in Delhi or that have been slowing things down as well um a lot of people made a lot of money from a lot of different sorts of relationships so\nUm when weapons sales are involved um you're looking at relationships that may be going back decades including back to the Cold War times and um people in stem who um have vested interests and other alliances or other purchases\nSo clearing away all of that brash in order to get things that are good for the strategic core of the nation can sometimes take a bit more time than expected\nThe puzzle about Vladimir Putin does he have a neutral image in Delhi is he regarded as somebody we can work with is there a general opinion\nThere's been a very long during they kind of so called non aligned period India's not aligned period um they didn't get a lot of weaponry from the Soviet Union and then from the Russians at a time when the U.S really wouldn't touch India at all so um there is you know it it's not considered a problem and\nUm I think there was during during the time when um the west was backing some pretty nasty elements in Afghanistan um the Indian knew that that John hottest problem would flow back to India\nAnd were I'm not averse to working with the Soviet strict not time either to try to contain it so a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with how to from one side and the problem with China on the other and that's the lens through which they view their relationship with Moscow\nAnd clear what is the state of flu between Islam about um Delhi today\nOh isn't that terrible uh and in fact what China did I'm immediately after ah India bought the ... the missile defense system was announced it was going to sell some very high tech drones to Pakistan so essentially opening up a second front\nFor that missile system to try to defend but from\nThe puzzle also about India playing the Russia card if that's what their play this can be a dangerous game the Russians are not easy to work with you that forgotten the Soviet days does that regarded as that was all that was then there's just now is that the fresh thinking\nThat really them because they're because if you look at the age of the people in both administrations they there are people who would have been engaging with each other perhaps is juniors\nOr during the Soviet period so they know each other um you know there there was there was all sorts of stories about Soviet infiltration into the Indian system during the during that period as well\nA lot of compromise material all that sort of stuff\nThat's the way of putting it yes\n[laughter] so um you know I think it takes a long time to to to read that up but also you know they ... the Soviets were there for India at a time when sometimes others weren't\nBut there is that the more serious problem is that a lot of the stuff that Russia sold to India has not been great equality hasn't been particularly good and the price tends to keep going up and up and up with a very slow delivery\nSo the actual quality of what's been sold in the past has been a real problem\nIs I Wonder if they're going to send all those all broken soup ... and ... back to Moscow for their money back\nI'm not sure they'd make ... you\nKnow there are by garden a V. sub Condon it becomes much more um [noise] the great game here with Russia entering into us\nOh you know whoever wins India as a partner is certainly got the leverage because India is enormous within about four years maybe even fewer than that it will be the world's most populous society and that means it has incredible power over not only the region but also elsewhere\nWashing Winston Churchill like a rotisserie going round and round and his grave\nCleo grill Pesca all of this Chatham House Gordon Chang's the Daily Beast on John ...\n\n\n\nStation and the Florida Panhandle ...

Michael that's what people were talking about seeing them at the photos where\nAll of a sudden pieces of how this word dangerous projectiles that went through cars are knocked in\nTo wall and just all kinds of crazy especially with water and especially with the um the mess that it's now left in its wake\nMexico beach because there's a place called Mexico beach in Florida is basically ground zero that's where it came in Michael did and coming in it did not come in with the winter the the damage to\nI'm sure millions of dollars tens of thousands of places were hit I shouldn't say tens of thousands and thousands of places were hit by this that especially the damage Bruce it was a cat for\nAnd it kind of hits it it definitely spread to several states but the Army Corps of engineers knows that the main damage started with\nThat Mexico beach area where you look out\nFrom a coastal view and higher concrete kind of um condo where some of those were spared and you look out and all you could see was debris it looked like tooth picks kind of like what you see when there's a tornado\nIt's devastating and you know Hurricane Florence just slammed the Carolinas last month\nWhat happens is you get these blue tarp proof patches and that's all over the Carolinas that are going to see that in parts of Florida in the panhandle to in some of the towns FEMA\nAnd the local governments of course they're going to call on that uh you know the the corps of engineers to help with the downed trees from the roads and the debris damage homes and buildings I mentioned\nThe destruction shows that you've got trash of about one million cubic yards is what they're saying so recovery is going to be tough but the first thing you had to do was clear that rose to the cruise\nHave an electronic set the table which for someone like him and actor guy who gets called all the time that's got to be in some ways that's got to be a pretty tough but anyway he and his wife have that rule he talks about it with me coming up next and talking about some of the things that he's been in that\nAnd even a little sports cars the Dodgers as they continue to roll through the playoffs his big\nDodger fan of course living in LA and growing up in Los Angeles but he was on the by the bell for ever that show when you're on a television show that's on the air for five six seven years that's pretty\nThat's pretty big and I think said by the bell man it's pretty much it was on through the um mid nineties so how about that\nAnd he's a big uh fitness dude and et cetera but anyway he joins us on the show and he talks about that whole thing about no electronics at the table and then we have a conversation with Kathy picket who says there was um\nA wrestler name the ultimate warrior who says that it was the ultimate warrior that really changed her life so what does that mean she talks about intuition and that whole thing where people say trust your guard listen to your guard\nDown people say that all the time listen to your gut and then you'll see a puzzled look in someone's face or like what does that mean [laughter] 'cause they're not in touch with their guts and what it's telling them it's your instincts what are your instinct saying what is your intuition telling you and I'll tell you what I Believe in intuition\n'cause every time I go against my intuition that's usually when I go down the wrong path there's a fork in the road whoops intuitions tell me one thing or the guts and then I'm thinking of something else and I go on the complete leave a wrong direction and so I Know somebody you know exactly I Know all of you know exactly what I mean\nAnd we're talking about that to to [noise] I mentioned the I'm\nIn talking about what was happening of course in D. C. so much is centering around I mean now the cabinet that the Kavanaugh stories I don't think it's over but he's the justice and he's in the thick of it now with with some the rest of the justices\nThey're going to be any kind of fallout from that well who knows if this is the mid term\nElections that a referendum on what happened there let's see what happens with voting I mean there's a big push to get the vote out but there's a big push by the Democrats and Republicans to do that [noise]\nUm so that's so we keep seeing the same thing it's not it has a strong in one direction or the other\nUntil we know I mean until until we see what the results are of that and of course hurricane Michael like I mentioned that's the big thing pummeling Florida pushing north\nThat what most of the conversation is about and the Dow dropping eight hundred points because fear is arising on what the interest rates are when the interest rates shoot up you get used to it's not that well what does that mean and then some fear\nStarts to spread by the way um the UN post now that\nNikki Haley is out at the end of the year but there wasn't any kind of discord between her the president in fact they had\nA press conference the other day so there is no issue with that but it looks like Dina Powell could be the person that gets tapped to for that and who is Dina Powell he's seen her face around you might recognize her that um that\nThe she is a former White House aide she was a deputy national\nSecurity advisor now she's in the senior execs at golden stacks she's very close with a volunteer Trump\nAnd son in law Jared Kushner who are of course our senior White house aides she had a friendly relationship when she left the White House and there wasn't a problem with the with that at all and she's definitely one of the candidates to replace Nikki Haley\nAnd there I'm sure some others that would make the list to because of course you got to get the approval to make that happen and she has the resume I suppose for that\nAnd that's what that's about ... any kind of a position especially position at the un in that role that's what that would absolutely\n... ... you know require\nFor that but that's not until the end of the year\nSo she leaves knew somebody new comes in maybe it's her see what that\nProcess ultimately is I'm like and then there is the story of them they're sure you want to hear what the merger I'm going to tell you about the merger cause I walked by the bloody pharmacies all the time I in fact I go in them if I'm if I was\nGoing to get medication is probably where I Would end up in the times I've had to it is actually mostly where I ended up CBS CBS the six\nIt's actually mostly where I ended up CBS CBS in sixty nine billion dollar merger was at now is approved in a deal that would probably probably can transform health care is it good for us or bad for us well you figure there's five million customers a day\nThat means the brick and mortar locations would turn into frontline clinics for basic medical services and patient monitoring so what does that mean it means that um\nMedications regimens being out of hospitals may be the basic services provided the right people are in there could be helpful there'll be flu shots minor illnesses would be treated he looked at CBS and got Ninety eight hundred retail stores and they've got eleven hundred minute clinics\nBut um I think that could have with the whole ... thing that could explode\nI don't know how they ... obviously they think that they can merge it properly and that it won't just the the whole scripts thing you could get it all in one I mean there's certainly pressures\n... and there's opportunity with what's going on in health care so this may be a merger that helps us if you and may I may you know we'll see causes by the end of the year I Need to know more about it I dug around a little bit today the key thing is look\nYou know all all of us now this I've talked about this before you go to the doctor what do you want from the doctor he want to know somebody who knows you and you want to feel confident in what you're being treated for and do you feel confident do you get the business about who you're going to see because they're not on the list and that's our aid for\nAre are you getting sub par treatment because your fabulous doctors had enough of this nonsense with the with the uh the healthcare system being upside down I'm Out of this business I've seen that happen a ton\nAnd you know frankly our faith in the medical profession it gets rocked because of that\nUnless you had somebody who stuck around like I have a doctor like that who does whatever he can to treat the people because\nHe is that the point in his career I guess er and his wife were annoys him what's happened and he figures out a way to treat people even if they don't have the right kind of insurance which bravo for him\nThat he can balance that out\nBy the way cook reminder because I Do get a couple of emails from people who were going down to Florida for business or family or whatever\nYou better check the airlines because they have canceled hundreds of flights so you'll get I'm sure you get a free waiver and to travel some other way or to travel on other time but they canceled a law ... flights\nEven for the next day I mean that'll that'll open up quickly but think of like Destin\nFort Walton Beach they've got airports there he just got to be sure about that and then you have Myrtle Beach in Savannah and Columbia South Carolina and all those other airlines where people fly into and um\nIt's the worst thing in the world if you don't check you just to see him you know you go and then\nFrom the same thing with the Amtrak to\nThey've got Amtrak that'll be affected by the\nThe ticket talking about\nIntuition years coming up next on\n\nTalk of one of radio\nABC News I'm Dave Packer author destruction as Michael marches through the south right

Pakistan Wall Street the Dow dropping over eight hundred points on Wednesday\nYou know take your time with it and then you'll notice little things that turn into bigger things and I think that that's how that's how it is for everybody no matter what you're doing in life it doesn't have to be\nA psychic or anything so um I think that's that's what we need to do and we feel like everything in our life is high time time pie and what you did a lot of people we schedule\nEverything in our life is high time time pac which it in a lot of people with that but I think you know if you slow down a little bit and just give yourself that time you know things will will manifest Oreo um so that's how it is you know for everybody and I think we need to remember that [laughter]\nI mean all that is really really great and by what has happened in your life when you haven't listened to your intuition\nOh gosh um when\nIgnore things for so long and um I think we just\nWe tend to do that because we just have this mindset like I'm going to do that I'm gonna do it my way I'm going to do it by bus and bad and for me um I Would have a physical sensation like and this highly very kind of like a lot of people where we we have\nThat may be down in our gut\nAnd um but it's not the fund feeling like you know people say butterflies are before you do something fun you know like how I was excited for it today though it's like that that feeling\nLike that's telling you don't do this or maybe you can do this just not right now\nUm and all I had that a lot with other things and I you know it didn't listen to it and you know everybody says your body doesn't lie and I read that so many high but it could be different for different people um you might not have a a sensation there by you know you might have\nJust something else that's just more of a knowing like\nI think this was going to go well I'm going to do it any way talk yourself you know so but my yeah mine was like in my ... and\nYou know I don't want to say that I regret things cause I Try to look at them like no they're learning experience but and then you know for the next time I'm you know how to improve on that\nOn yeah because we have to live with regrets so maybe you might just regret that how\nYou know but maybe not the what so yeah for me that we're a young guy and it still will it be that but now I Know about you know ... and like I said for different people so when you have things\nYou know even write them down I was told that forever write stuff down because then you'll remember\nAnd I think that helps a lot better than just hey wait a minute you know when this happened before and um you know but we are were quick to jump the gun I Know I I feel I'm but I'm learning you know and I think that's how it is that's why we're here yeah we're here\nYeah I write it down absolutely no ... in clothing and there's so much meaning the one thing I Hope people take\nYour book uh you know I just want them to you know what I'm gonna I'm going to quote or you're on the um you know because they just think it's so powerful yet so many great speeches\nOn inspire don't instruct I just walk back today um because I just think you know we there's so much we want to share a but just to believe in your own power even if you're not by the\nSpiritual in that way or we all have that in us no matter\nHow you believe that and no matter what you believe and um you know what you're sending out there I'm just so trust and to just um\nYou know believe in yourself that's the biggest key of all and that you know my book even though it's you know dealing with a celebrity which can be intimidating for some people you can solve the him out or anybody else\nYou know anybody else but possibly past or you know things that

places that they were broadcasting from a very strange I have\nTo say any American tonight who better than kick us off than Elon Rattner from TOP Media news Ellen I'm sure you saw some of that coverage job boy that a hurricane is something unbelievable what happened I\nDon't think that the category for that Hurricane Katrina even now that\nThe Internet was a category five\nAnd the difference between a category for in a category five it's only about five miles per hour\nAnd in terms of it looks like at Cain Michael was somewhere between one hundred and fifty and a hundred and fifty five miles an hour when they want a category five\nSo I mean it's just awful and it looks like a lot of these homes are totally and completely underwater now I Do know from\nCovering Hurricane Katrina which I did and also don't the community center down there a lot of people have insurance\nFor both the community center down there a lot of\nPeople have insurance they think they have flood insurance and they do but they don't have mould insurance and the mold can go right up the wall and that is what two story house 'cause\nYeah I and I remember that because I think the first time I imagine you invited me down to Mississippi\nAnd remember that and that was um and that was all about what happened after BP and I was done to learn what had happened in Biloxi and it was great what what you did to help the people there\nAnd and the fact that uh they they told people look we're going to put an ax if you're not going to leave are going to put an ax on your door because the door might not even be there but we know that at least we might find someone behind it saying it was ... yeah absolutely absolutely crazy\nSo it used to all that so there were people reporting from in from all the networks I just thought this was interesting as a longtime broadcaster a I Am and you are what what did you make of\nThe decision of whether to cover break in or whatever you know ABC was all over with this but the ...\nWell arguing that were hired on ... and and you saw this guy get hit while he was on the ground I guess I wouldn't do it if I was\nA manager and I think that they they say that they're going to have better pictures by tomorrow morning because they're going to send planes and satellites and things like oh that's what they should be doing they shouldn't be having somebody there and I agree in harm's way\nMhm I hear you yeah I thought\nI thought it was strange to I I you're right if I was reading the news you might have been covered this somehow a little bit differently for sure so while that's happening there's conversation about another Michael is going to run for president\nWell of course\nYou know I always say that if you become senator you look in the mirror and you see the next president in nine states but Michael Bloomberg the billionaire he came you know he didn't make his money came up with this machine et cetera\nAnd he did serve as a mayor and I think that he sees himself as the next president nine states I really do it's too bad I I don't think he's going to win but he thinks he's going to win and I guess if you have a billion dollars and you have nothing else to do with your\nTime why not\nIt doesn't it deems that they leave even though they know there's the potential of massive flooding loss of power and all the things that that involves when you have a cat for a cat five one person\n\nBut a lot of homes without power Michael smashes then Wednesday at about two o'clock eastern cat for near that place I just mentioned Mexico Beach Florida and the strongest storm to hit the U.S\nSince Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two and if you've ever seen any of the video or any of the photographs from from that you know exactly what Andrew did especially the parts of Miami how devastating that was on the other coast of Florida\nSo marinas were turned upside down homes were left with piles of rubble everywhere where they used to stand\nAnd it's gotten slower since it's made landfall that's the good news way slower as it trapped up through Charlotte and through Raleigh Durham and and all the way up and over\nBut a later this week it moves into the Atlantic\nBut there's flooding on the Gulf Coast there's down trees utility poles and of course that makes it tough on the whole rescue idea\nSo there's curfews in nine counties there is a boil water notice in Dade County one of the counties and even believe it or not with hurricane sometimes they spawn tornadoes said there was even a tornado watch in effect\nAnd that's in effect until two o'clock in the morning eastern enough\nOn a Thursday a rat's because of looting which has always been sad to me that I don't care what your economic situations picking off and take advantage of a situation when something devastating like I'm Michael is happening I saw a picture of a\nBank that um it was in Panama City and it it looked\nLike all the glass windows had just blown out you could see right through the bank that might have been the craziest example and it was maybe five floors this tank\nShopping centers piles of rubble buildings stripped walls and roofs all that kind of thing just down down down Panama City got slammed big time too\nAnd some people try to ride it out and it was pretty scary and they need to survive\nAnd some people try to ride it out and it was pretty scary and they may be survived but you you have gigantic trees that are lying through stores and I mean I could go on with my description because I saw a lot of this\nBut it's that the Florida Panhandle area south eastern Alabama southern Georgia some of you are from there live there you know ...\nWhat I mean I mean it is a nasty storm so now it's clean up time again you know when something like that happens it's all about that is picking everything up and it's going to be it's going to be a lot of pick up because you had a lot of homes\nThat are in various states of disarray I mean it's it's pretty nasty and that's going to\nCertainly take some of the female action it's going to certainly take all of that emergency assistance\nIn Florida and Alabama and some of those other spots as as well ah 'cause it really just battered his battered parts of Florida it's so interesting when you look at a map of Florida\nHello welcome to the sunshine state [laughter]\nAnd we look at it and where you're either get on the east you're getting it on the tip if it's Key West or else is going right up the backside and it's all the way up through the Gulf Coast missing Tampa and some of those other areas and you just never know you just watch the path of it\nBut the fact that it hit the way it hit was the key thing because there was no this was this storm let's put it this way this storm had no back down move that was that there was it did not back off\nIt's just a mess just about clean up and it's\nInteresting because Florida has been dealing with sadly red tide\nSo now you got hurricane Michael pushing it a shores what some of them are saying that okay so now you're going to have that\nYou get that red tide that has been killing fish and releases all those toxins there's people that are having trouble with breathing their respiratory system because it's acts sort of like a tear gas for ... for some people\nAnd the red tide has been that toxic algae has been something that they've been dealing with all over the state now with this\n... this storm the storm pushed the algae deeper into the water or does it push it up near the surface\nAnd how quickly just freshwater from rain fall flow back toward the coast killing the algae so it just depends on the storm the particulars of the storm that crazy just another thing\nTo worry about it just like what happened with Florence there was all those fish all over the place and they had to clean them up dead fish everywhere because of what had washed in and they were concerned about\nContamination they were concerned about what people were doing that concerned about water so you know there's a whole checklist of ... we got through this and our roof didn't blow off the neighborhoods that were going to help them but now here's all the other things that we have to worry about\nHere's all the other things that we have to worry about and\nThere's like a huge list wild that's going on during the day\nThere was something else that was happening that we haven't talked about in a very long time on the show because it's really gone through what has been an amazing\nTime as far as the market is concerned I mean the market has been up up up occasionally a bounce here and there but the market just dealt with a God I mean you could hear that such a big time\nIt just collapsed I'm going to say collapse not collapse like two thousand and eight but really really really took a dive and that's something that we're not used to seeing right why did the stock market tank so much\nAnd what is it that drove it in that direction so like I said a crazy day while all these emergencies or going off in Florida but it was um on Wall street\nThere was a little bit of a panic because\nIt's been such a hot market and out of nowhere seemingly eight hundred and thirty two point drop for the Dow Jones just a week after there was a record highs that roller coaster ride so what was it\nWas it the ten year treasury note whose rate impacts the pricing on things from fixed rate mortgages houses to stocks virtually every other financial asset on the planet that you can think of\nClimbing to three point twenty five percent for the first time since two thousand and love and the spring of two thousand eleven is it what's happening with the U.S trade war with China\nIs that some of them I think it's the interest rates rising is a big reason why they're rising because economic data has been positive\nSo of these historically low interest rates and slow economic growth now we're picking up to speed with the economy growing it four point two percent of the second quarter is the fastest we've seen him for years the job market is\nFlush the unemployment rate is three point seven percent the lowest in fifty years that's what's happening\nSo higher interest rates slew of sat around and flip the equation around and that the deal and text from the stock's\nDropped a bunch of those drop the gun is at the beginning of a correction that's what everybody's talking about [noise] coming up we're hitting the mail bag to get your thoughts here on America Tonight with me keep delaying [noise]\n[noise]\nTalk on the radio [laughter]\nABC News I'm Dave Pecker auditor destruction as Michael marches through the south right now the storm hitting the Florida Gulf Coast as a category for hurricane the strongest ever to make landfall their\nHouses knock from their foundations roofs torn off a two deaths have been reported governor Rick Scott saying resources are being placed where they're needed\nThis includes thousands of responders for power restoration medical search and rescue law enforcement food and water distribution and every other critical resource\nHundreds of thousands without power right now Michael is now a tropical storm and it's churning through Georgia and Russia has been made and a deadly upstate New York limo crash that claimed the lives of twenty people Norman Hussein as the operator a procedure limousines and the soda companies owner whose fathers out of the country\nCoastal towns in Florida and every time now that is in my head like I look at it like oh I can see why I see why this happens when you have these hurricanes and it it is it's sad to see\nYou know houses underwater and knowing what happens afterwards but hopefully the people inside were gone and now when they come back\nIt is about to get out rebuilding whatever it takes but when you look at the category scaled and you're talking about cats for one thirty to one fifty six\nI mean really cats five yeah and I was looking at hurricanes and cat four and five Andrew was definitely a thought and it was awful [noise]\nMichael for but just by a couple of miles\nPer hour you've had um remember we've had just thinking this the other day I was trying to someone was asked me names and that everything was Irma last year Harvey I mentioned Harvey and of course\nCamille was one of the most deadly and that was right there off the Gulf Coast Louisiana and that's way back in the late sixties I saw some old footage of that somebody was playing the old footage and it was\nBoy it look nasty and Camille was devastating Andrew was devastating I mean all of these or you know her hurricane season you know that that's the ... the possibility in all the things that goes with it like I said okay let's jump to another one this one is from Charlie\nKate I'm listening to you in Sarasota it's like we feel so badly for the people who are just north of us and we'll race to help them and we know exactly what that's like as we've gone through that crazy watch of\nHow bad is it going to be what kind of devastation is going to leave behind and we dodged at the time but we dodged it all along knowing where Michael was tracking there was no way of a massive curve there and it was very sad to see what other people are dealing with\nIf you live and the coast you know that this is a risk that you take when you go through hurricane season you just have to be ready and prepared much like I'm sure the people in California I think about earthquakes or others think about tornadoes\nExcept for at least with the hurricanes whether they veer off or they the wind speed dies down which was always a good thing\nYou have no warning when the earthquake and very little with the tornado there they've gotten better but you can't predict those things exactly oh you live near a fault line and the other big ones comments every Californian says that we know we know we live with the big ones come in so I think it's a little bit different with the hurricane at least there's a little\n[noise] there's a little bit of time to to clear and this one's a quick one I mean it's there wasn't a ton of time here it's just all of a sudden it was bad you know you had like a couple of days yes we're tracking this boom all of a sudden it\nComes in now I've got this one from Joe who says lost in the day probably was that house majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to introduce legislation that's kinda fun President Trump's proposed wall along the U.S Mexican border with that twenty three point four billion dollar\nPrice tag Kate do you think it will go through well it's in the I think it's in drafting but it's supposed to come out your right and the next couple of days they call it pro forma\nHouses in recess until mid November So after the midterm elections the they wouldn't consider the legislation for another month or so I you know I don't know what would have a difficult passage it could because\nThere's not you can't control the numbers completely and um you know ...\nWent to the U.S Mexico border for a tour or going for a tour and a briefing by the department of homeland security\nBut um he's you know there are a couple of there are a couple of Republicans who are interested in seeing it passed but it's a numbers game so money for the border wall has been a very contentious battle in any of the negotiating between the Democrats and Republicans\nThe entire time the president has been in office so\nThe legislation being written it okay but what does it mean well any of this be paid for by Mexican remember we kept hearing well Mexico is going to pay for part of the wall Mexico is going to let him say part Mexico's paying for the wall\nSo I think it may have a tough time if it passes the house you still need sixty votes to clear the Senate that's a pretty big threshold coming up next [noise]\nIt's time to nail the score paid five five to six sixty to eighty three they'll score next to me Kate dilemma here on eight ten [noise]\n[noise]\nWhen you use public why ... an identity be anything you do on line\n... photos your Web history even your

and say anything having to do\nWith oil prices with fuel costs because I Know that they looked at cost controls\nAnd they also looked at cost savings that's in a plan that's been in the works for

where they make most of their money correct\nWell sure and that's the case for a whole lot of cameras to I'm just turning to delta press release that song about revenue grows up eight percent and

LVN age more then is easily be ... on that actually came out and sort of confirmed the speculation that had been around as far as what the customs\nAuthorities were doing so you know I say that that's one part of the story you know today you look at\nDelta Airlines out with or owning a they went over well I mean the third quarter results are more about what the company had to say for the year because they're looking now for revenue to be at the high end of their age\nYou know third quarter sales didn't look so good relative to what the deal is we surveyed the river where expecting me that said delta managed to compensate for most of the increase in fuel costs that they had during the corner\nA by raising fares and holding down other expenses so they're optimistic in line with\nWith airlines we should also mention that oil prices have been declining for the past two days and that the ... came out today and said that\nThey actually expects lowered demand from slower economic growth globally we're going to be speaking more about that are coming up later in the show but there's also give pretty rosy backdrop to the airlines this is one of their top expenses right fuel costs\nAbsolutely so that's another part of the mix\nAnd you throw in what L Brands Victoria's Secret and other retailers had to say about a last month saved store sales or through first so stores open more than a year\nThey rose five percent analyst the surveyor only looking for about one percent so that stocks taken off L Brands up about eleven and a half percent so\nThey said there were a bit since ... sort of working in favor of stocks at this point\nYou know it's interesting there was a story that caught my eye by ... uh on on the Bloomberg this morning looking at how there haven't been many were uh companies that were reporting and I believe about twenty two I ... at at around that\nSo far for the third quarter earnings season but even if they beat earnings estimates there are stocks are still being punished and why this is a concern\nFor a lot of analysts heading into this quarter especially because there is a chance that we'll see more Mrs than we have in recent quarters just because of some of these pressures on on march ends due to the increasing costs and the higher labor costs you know in a higher higher ... just good costs\nRight and and loose story also pointed out that there is more of an agreement among analysts in terms of earnings that company so the idea that you know the highest versus the low estimate I'm seeing some of the narrowest gaps since two thousand it's according to data from bank for important\nIt's important because it gives you a sense of what the expectations are so if you get a number that's outside the estimates well let's put it this way you have a higher chance of that\nAnd then you also have the potential for more of a reaction in the stock you know we've certainly seen that this week with the legs of the PG industries they even just sort of alluded to what their third quarter results would be and that\nWas enough to send the stock down ten percent and that was before yesterday's debacle\nSo the interesting thing among the the market action to me has been the first stop on correlation we talked about a lot about it yesterday how people have been concerned that treasury yields have been rising in tandem with stock selling off normally you don't see bonds in stocks move together like that\nOne is supposed to provide a ballast to the other I find it\nInteresting there was a ten year treasury auction yesterday it was a little soft there was a three year auction a little soft we're getting we're starting to see you know just\nA lack of demands to the degree that we had seen in the past and I'm looking right now to ten year treasury\nA that is continuing to sell off today with the ... of rising possibly on the heels of is better than expected announcement but how much will that kind of provide a check on equity markets in the sense that you know the better the news is for equity is the more bonds will sell off ... rise\nAnd then people start to get worried about higher interest rates inflicting pain upon stocks I mean how much are we going to just be a range of ...\nThat that becomes certainly something to watch and one thing that's notable especially today when you go through the main industry groups in the U.S and the five hundred worst performer utilities now you'd expect that\nIt rates are going up there if because let's face it these companies they pay relatively identity as a they borrow a lot of money so you know there's a lot of influence of from rates on their performance\nThe only thing though is if you look at the past week utility stocks had been the best performers among the eleven million industry groups or the U.S and the five hundred so you know today you are seeing something that might be considered a more normal performance after a time when\nBeing that might be considered a more normal performance\nAfter a time when the stock space ... was strategist scratching their heads yeah and us twisting ourselves and not trying to come up with reasons behind it all they will simply ... the editor columnist and blogger at M. life go on at the Bloomberg thank you so much\nFor being here with us we are seeing green on the screen as we were just talking about and things really did take a turn out to those headlines\nThat there are reports that President Trump and president Xi Jinping of China are poised to meet a possibly to soften some of the trade tensions that have been ongoing right now it's had joined I didn't know when studios in Washington DC Nancy lines with Arab world and national headlines Nancy thanks Lisa tropical\nStorm Michael continues to weaken as it moves over eastern Georgia and makes its way toward the Carolina in Panama City Florida John ... and his family rode out the storm in their home\nAll right well David just just to sort of push back a little bit here I mean we've known for a trade war for a while he's known about the increasing trade tensions between China and the U.S\nWe'd also known about the tell the forecast for fed a rate hike so we've known both of these things for a while how can you pick the recent sell off on one or the other I mean it seems like somewhat it it's a factor of both of them ...\nJoining up pride I mean if nothing else how do you teach us out\nWell you can say the following trade war rhetoric which started at the beginning of this year\nSaid well we're going to become bellicose and the markets okay\nThis is the Iowa of confrontation it's a style of negotiation but in the end it'll all work out and we'll get to the middle and compromise and that was a progression meanwhile the rhetoric intensified then we had some settlements so we've seen Mexico Canada\nKorea we were seeing settlements when you examine the result of all the belligerent see there's not much in the way of change the big one is China the second largest economy in the world for times our population\nAnd a very active participant in Asia and that has been digging deeper and deeper and deeper and now we're in a position where there's no truth\nThere's twenty twenty five percent terror that denounced\nThe U.S must follow through under Trump or Trump will have said something and I have to bring it back that's not his way\nSo that tore or did they notice today the market rallied for ... seconds yeah on this meeting wizardry and it's turning red again for good reason when you pick a fight as a bully in the schoolyard pick on somebody small don't take on the guy who's your saw All right\nWell I you know let's let's just take a little bit deeper though because right now we're still seeing fundamental strong we're still seeing profits rising at U.S companies so you know would this be a buying opportunity even given some of the outstanding concerns\nAbout trade tensions uh let alone rate rise is there anything else\nWell that's an interesting question to evolve I Can't say what it is I can tell you what we're doing we are focused on the ATF portfolios domestic centric\nAs long as we see risk in the international structure the U.S oriented portfolio is going to look at mid cap small cap even though they corrected domestic businesses and selected sectors like defense\nThat one is not going to be touched it's going to do well\nSo that the stock area on the bond area we're doing a barbell interest rates are definitely on a higher trajectory how far when what the influences are

... also seeing some pretty substantial unprecedented out slows I'm just wondering I mean do you think that this is a harbinger of what's to come or do you think that this is just sort of\nA knee jerk positioning by a number of big institutions\nWell I think it's a harbinger of rising risk going we had this discussion a couple of years ago the short term interest rate was near zero out too\nWhen we had this discussion a couple of years ago the tax free interest rate was three high grade tax free trade today above for when we had this discussion taxable mortgage backed securities were lower now

law\nAll right thank you David as a democratic takeover of the house in November looks more likely President Trump is escalating his attacks on his political opponents telling an audience in Iowa on Tuesday that Democrats are trying to turn the U.S and to Venezuela\nAnd a half years doing arson has\nThe power to and we left wing ma and that's what I like\nTo ... is a Bloomberg News the White House reporter he Jones joins us now for more on this story by phone from the White House and to what are the politics of the president's extreme attacks on Democrats as extreme\nYeah this is a bed by the White House and by the Trump political team that the upcoming election is going to be all about motivating and inspiring\nThe base of the base of both parties to come out so we've seen the president go from talking about Democrats obstructionists using much more dark language calling them\nI'm basically saying that they are looking to turn the U.S into Venezuela out of their socialist that they're willing to allow crime to come into the U.S he's called them the party of crime at some point\nIt's really an effort to rile up the the base and get more people motivated to vote in November ... sort of using the politics of fear and saying you know Democrats pick over it's going to cause chaos and gridlock and crime\nAnd poverty a painting this dark picture of what would happen if Democrats take over in order to try to encourage his voters who may not be as motivated to turn out in the mid term to to turn out in ... in November we've seen a lot of enthusiasm on the Democratic side\nAre Democrats turning out in very large numbers president tried to match that enthusiasm any he's using\nA sort of harsh language attacking Democrats to do that and I've talked to some Republican strategist who said that you know Democrats have given the president some ammunition here by\nUh embracing things like Medicare fall for all having you know some of these massive protests in some cases they were doing a civic action in places like restaurants and uh in the capital and being disruptive\nSo the president isn't making all of this up when he talks about you know Democrats wanting to uh cause cause some form of disruption uh at some point that sometimes he goes a little bit overboard in terms of characterizing or Democrats are and what they what their policy positions are [noise]\nBut uh it is his political strategy to try to motivate his orders to come out in the ...\nThis is about as strident as his rhetoric against the Democrats has been correct\nYeah we don't normally see president Steve that open about their disdain for the opposition party we've seen presidents in the past sort of take the role of you know criticizing the policies of another party but not necessarily saying they have bad motives are that they're anti American or that their socialist\nOr that you know they want to turn America into a third world country\nSo this is language that definitely much more a colorful than what we've seen in the past but this is also a president who came in the ... that came into office or you know insulting his opponents and giving them nicknames and throwing out the rules of the political playbook\nSo it's not too surprising that he would continue that while in office but in terms of how he acts up against his predecessors is definitely very different in a unique approach to a political strategy\nBut the but this could backfire on the president he could end up just um you know firing up more Democrats to turn out\nYeah that is definitely a possibility and some of the political strategist I've talked to have said\nThey believe that you know Democrats are already fired up and they're not as much downside to the president using this type of incendiary language because Democrats are shown that they were fired up just by the president being the president and by the fact that he often\nHave shown that they were fired up just by the president being the president and by the fact that he often does things to anger Democrats a but this is language that could potentially fire or you know have a downside for the president as well if it doesn't inspire\nVoters and some of those voters in the middle who can be swayed either way are turned off by the fact that the president is using such a aggressive language against his political opponents are a lot of people who are not happy with the gridlock in Washington\nAnd the president of the party the leader of the country uh speaking in such stark terms and not necessarily having maybe one of his political aides or somebody who's working for him behind the scenes do that it does raise the risk that people will be turned off and potentially\nA lot of the suburban voters lots of moderate voters who may have voted for president in twenty sixteen according to polls have been turned off by some of his policies and some of the way some of the things that he's done an office\nAnd that type of language could potentially backfire the president and lead to some of those people are women moderate voters leaving the party and voted for Democrats and the return\nTo Lou ...

thank you so much Doug we'll be checking in with you throughout the afternoon chasing here alongside Taylor rigs market may then that she is\nLive titled have yeah its market market have in the ... you know you bring it all you bring it altogether or what's jumping out to you before we get into a deeper discussion was jumping out of the you mentioned that the Texas\nRight now it's really interesting 'cause we just had such a big sell off yesterday and we've been fluctuating between gains and losses saying I was particularly looking at the NASDAQ one hydrated which is the largest tech companies\nAre flirting with some gains earlier now just a little bit maybe an change slightly and read 'em and then the asking the five hundred there were a lot of talk about the one hundred and two hundred day moving average if we want to do more technical and set a fundamental now says style\nI think a lot going on we could bring in\nJail and the boys\nAre market editor for Bloomberg News and they will send our stocks editor as well over from Bloomberg News says Joe uh you know I was talking a little bit about tax what you've never seen today at does it feel different from yesterday in terms of fundamentals are driving this or is it a little bit more of just the momentum and get ...\nYou know what is striking to me about today's market is actually on the currencies front\nWhen you look at our a top performing currencies they don't look like what you would expect to see on a big sell off number one performing currency Turkish lira number to perform and currency arguing time peso number ... perform encouraging South African Rand\nNumber six Russian ruble\nNow typically these are sort of risky high beta currencies they've been in the firing line for a while and I\nIt just doesn't feel like panic when that turkey Argentina in South Africa or getting bought\nAnd I think that's been the story last few days for his intense as the selling has been in sheer numbers at no time I think has it ever really felt like panic and I suspect that most of the people that you've spoken to and it certainly who we've spoken to on TV no one's panicking a lot of people saying that by the ... but\nThere is a flipside to that argument do you look at gold being up about thirty dollars announced trading above the twelve hundred round twelve twenty five I only bring that up because he mentioned the ran and if you look in the south African mining stocks in the Canadian mining stocks and all these uh\nGoals related companies they're having a heck of a day to day so you know you can argue that what we're seeing in stocks doesn't portray much concern what's happening with precious metals and with the mining companies so tells a bit of a different story at least for the moment\nYou know Ben email and he's the chief economist ever intellect partners and he wrote an interesting piece this morning about correlation how do we feel about correlation right now when stocks are lower typically use the\nYields lower price higher on the bond yeah but you mentioned like for example the classic stage fright and train and moving that much how do we feel about where we are with the correlation\nYeah yeah not catching much of a bed and of course that's been the defining aspect of this fall's ... February's volatility is that when stock sold off sharply there were selling in a long and treasury has to\nI think we're talking about this yesterday at the same time that I think this is a function of people being more concerned about inflation than this inflation or deflation and that is arguably the biggest change if you think about the almost ten years now or nine years post crisis\nFor most of those years the concern was not inflation and so that means when you're nervous you buy bonds but when you're concerned about inflation you're nervous you don't want to buy bonds\nThat being said there's not much inflation we got CPR today it was pretty some dude and that raises a whole different a sort of set of questions which is\nAt what point does the lack of inflation till the fed like you just don't need to be that much but it's just not an issue you can you can have your cake and eat it too low unemployment without worries about inflation\nRight now they're not they're well that would be a message that would resonate certainly with the president who is used terms like ... to describe the Federal Reserve interesting a headline that just came across the Bloomberg I just got a lot of course\nVery well known investor chief investment officer of double line capital saying when it comes to I'm quoting here when it comes to President Trump is clear to me that he's been crazy like a Fox with is that rhetoric where he doesn't want to take the blame Dave what's what is the rhetoric here\nWell good question I'm not a political analyst so you know trying to figure out the back and forth is a real issue\nBut when it comes down to is you know people do have some concern that because the fed is sort of on this course of raising interest rates and you know they're relatively optimistic about the economy at least to the chairman Jay powers from his latest comments the other day\nThat if this becomes an issue in terms of you know where the economy is headed and were share prices are headed so you know that is as much as anything a focus here is certainly at least one of the explanations for the fact that we're down for a six day in her own answer divide wondered\nWell some of those inflation pressure like you mentioned I mean we was hyped ... by asking you a question and getting getting ten second stand that margin concerns as we hadn't earning some of the input cost pressures that we're saying is that a legitimate concern\nWhat we've certainly seen that in summer of a preliminary results in the back to a couple of days ago PG ... measure certainly raising does and we've seen it in a reaction to what some of the early results and it's going to be something to watch is already ...\nThat's a very good point about earnings as well All right Dave Wilson socks editor you will be back with us for your chart instructor day job was into\nWell All right Dave Wilson socks editor you will be back with us for your chart instructor day Joe ... send you off to do some television coast of what you miss\nComing up at four pm quickly a tailor the bite of the day the number six hundred million wow you know what does that tell me ... signed a deal a dialogue semi conductor to license UK chip designers power management technology and acquire certain assets\nPay dialogue an initial three hundred million plus an additional three hundred million for product delivery over the next few years there's your bite alright for more\nBills for some world and national headlines and for that Bob living in the eleven Israel have I didn't get Jason Taylor breaking news across the Bloomberg terminals itself or the White House expects North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson to be\nHad tips Joe was intel 'cause he tweeted this story out earlier brought a tour attention and it was by Ari Shapiro he's managing editor of equities for Bloomberg joining us in our Bloomberg interactive brokers studio\nAnd I don't want to spoil too much of this but basically it's a breakdown of big stocks and some big name hedge funds who really took a bath and are taking a bath on some of these names so Ari welcome tell us how you got this idea\nThanks for having me um well I think part of it came from some of the news that came over a test a couple of weeks or about some big name hedge funds and not even just big name large size hedge funds that have had to close shop I'm a recently whether they want it to where they had to um at twelve billion dollar fund high feels capital\nI'm criteria are the two billion dollar fund just the other day we learn that um tour beyond which is run by Jason carpet big name in the industry at a return a billion dollars\nOr so to me it it's interesting when you know the confluence of news just kind of comes together and you're you're just seeing a lot of this kind of come out of nowhere and then you know all of a sudden you get to the fact that you know October comes around and the market started to really sell off\nSo I'm looking at you know I'm you know you've already heard a lot about hedge funds not having exactly a great year um some ... bad performance on shrinking assets um all of a sudden a bit of a you know I Would say still a mini meltdown um when you look at a much longer terms charred on stocks for sure [noise]\nUm but the thing is when you kind of dive right into it it's which sucks right getting hit the most um which are the ones that are really um you know falling out of bed I'm versus say you know some of the more defensive or a larger cap names that are not\nSay in the tax base um so uh you know I did a little ... is booming from many different ways and a different functions and find you know which stocks have been down in the most and which ones have a you know a lot of hedge fund ownership\nA relative to others and to me I mean you know kind of a showed up a lot of names that are are household names a name like a Roku I'm like an at sea spotted by somebody's or even reason I was actually I think most of them that I just mentioned are um stitched fix auto desk\nUm these are all a tech names um some of them are you know kind of straddle that consumer um you know consumer slashed tech\nUm field um and so uh you know you look at how much they're down we're talking you know twenty percent Seventeen percent Fifteen Percent within a matter of five six days um that is not insignificant right I'm a ... that has a massive amount I'm In a in a very very short time\nAnd I think what's interesting is when we talk about hedge funds so often we think that it's very complex instruments that are going on and and complex deals and really sometimes at the end of the day it really is just buying and selling stocks and the market like that's really can push some people over the edge\nI Wonder as you did your research you know what is it that margin call that that turned into the hedge funds is it just the fact that they're down ten percent you know what is sort of driving the reason that these hedge funds are getting caught in the middle of this mark and sell off\nYou know ... it's a good question it could be anything from just you know bad ... to some of the things um you mentioned so\nIt's very it's the one thing I Will say is um you know we know for sure that a lot of the biggest names out there that the fangs the Facebook ... I mean these are very crowded names for a lot of ... you know or if you're involved fine but if you know as\nThe word Hedges and your name you should be hedged and I'm\n... and we'll talk about that because it it does feel like hedge fund has become this sort of catchall term or we throw it around politicians throw it around but that but what you're talking about is fundamentally not what they were meant to do\nRight I think it's case by case depending on what asked the class that I'm you know these hedge funds or belong and I mean some of them are long short and strictly you know very equity base and if you're getting crushed and a lot of these names right now these heavy tech names and say you don't have\nA puts on the spiders or you don't have other sorts out there to help offset this year and a lot of trouble right now um and uh you know it it it's one of those things where you know come to the end of the quarter it's it's it's it's time to figure out what what what exactly to do and how bad I'm of course he really had\nTalking because they are just some of the names you mentioned like a ... for example which today and just some basic some headline news is getting hurt you some things in China or getting having a top quarter what specifically where some of the names that you found that are really hurting\nYou know it's funny I I was I was looking at square earlier today some of the other um stock that I mentioned we're done\nReally hurting you know it's funny I I was I was looking at square earlier today some of the other\nUm stocks that I mentioned we're done a lot more but now I mean look they had news last night um their CFO was a very influential and important person I'm In that company is no longer there and that's clearly hitting the stock today um I\nI think now I think you can almost call it um the poster child for a momentum stocks right now I'm ... be look at the numbers it's almost thirty percent\nUm and it varies you know ... days um that that is just nothing to sneeze at square is a big company um they have a very ah ah you know a big name behind it and we're talking thirty billion market cap at this point and they were not thirty billion you know several days ago\nUm but again a lot of it it's just kind of the well known names the household names and the ones that are really kind of gone parabolic over the past year I mean really\nEnd of the day look a lot of these talks are still up um you know for for the past year longer but but but that being said people chase the stocks will crowd into them and uh when I noticed
