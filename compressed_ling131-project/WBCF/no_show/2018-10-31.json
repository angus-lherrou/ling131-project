line then huh you should have yeah probably got all scared I was going to yell at them like\nThat William ... turning William\nYelled at me writing yeah that's true he did raise his voice first\nEl upset and it was all mad and frustrated right now there's no set up and I kept saying no dude let's do this just tell me what my mum to people now on Twitter who have a problem with it everybody as long as you're on fire ... yeah\nYeah you know ... ... what happens though you always see the negative first in court just jumps out at you like thirty thousand people just say you've got chocolate voice lady you know working with you and then what versus like what's up with a girl and then your own or do we well maybe not to write about right or wrong working on and\nI'm working on that and you're doing much better that much ... voice ...\nLet me go to the phone line did not say load welcome to lie to read it has been so incredibly incredibly patient Brett I'm going to give you the time you need my friend what's going on\nWell thank you I was calling about that fourteenth the ... amendment issue sure and they had a couple of points uh one I don't think that Trump believes he has the power and I and I disagree a little bit with Ted Cruz I think he was being a maybe just trying to that didn't want to get into it with Trump I don't believe Trump thinks he has the power to do that and I don't believe you\nAre you going to start the argument\nI think he's starting the argument I think he wants to look at the interpretation and I do think there's an argument there even even though he may not win it but I Do think looking at the unpleasantness of being born there having a jurisdiction and then using the conjunction and and then talking explicitly about jurisdiction it'd be an argument can be used\nBut that was not intend to the law and I think that's what they'll try I think it may lose but they will try\nWas that what we we were interesting to me is that when you read through with Howard had to say in the federalist papers they clearly says it wasn't intended for foreign dignitaries or aliens it says that\nBut they didn't put it in the fourteenth amendment and this is my argument argument is invent Williams wrong about intent argument is that you're wrong about intent you're both right you're absolutely right the problem is they wrote it in plain English that's easy to understand\nRight the problem is they wrote it in plain English that's easy to understand\nAnd it doesn't say it in there they should have made it longer they should've included not of course not including foreign dignitaries and and uh in aliens and so on I mean I then it would be spelled out it would be clear and not one person could be an anchor baby the problem is the way they wrote it\nWas to some ... they assumed that we would know what the intent was when that is the job of the founding document the founding document is meant to say these are the laws these are the rights these are the restrictions on government this is the way it is and if that doesn't cover everything amen to me\nUm the liberals are the ones who actually want us to interpret everything and make everything a living breathing document that's not what it is it's a chiseled in stone foundation and and I think that you and I understand that William was mad at me you've been on hold long time you read that call it was mad at me because I\n... used to not repeat English I just read would have said\nWell I understand that I think too though that um when it was originally written it was with it in regard to the slaves I don't think the time they were thinking in terms of babies being born here\nHad no idea what you're halfway or a hundred percent right it was about slavery younger brother only\nAt some point someone came along 'cause that's what lawyers do and interpret it that way and had it backed up well the possibility exists to reinterpret though because it was once and interpretation himself\nThat it was you know you're you're right the Supreme Court interpreter to I think an Eighteen Ninety six Eighteen Ninety somewhere around there and yeah and they they're the ones that said yes this applies to anybody born here of yeah not not only do I want it to be reinterpreted I actually want it\nTo be rewritten I Want to be altered to say the original intent not including foreign dignitaries not including aliens and including fill in the blank make it clear because the founding documents should not be interpreted in my opinion it should be read and understood\nI I don't think that's asking much I\nDon't think you're absolutely correct yeah I think Trump that will bring that out by pushing that she's going to push it out there whether or not he was you know I probably will there's you know but at least he's bringing it out and I'm good with that and I only got\nOne other quick point I think you'll like this is um I Do believe that William will be happy because we are if it does get reinterpreted we'll be right in line with France they did that Ninety two under the way we\nSaid [laughter] well well thank God we we didn't want the laws are afraid to be our laws I guess are I'd appreciate your bread appreciate holding let's see there is a nice conversation\nNow when you look back and he pretty much has the same exact stances William without getting all mad and frustrated when he got right to the point here is that they intended here's what it says here's what we have to do and and also you know the reason why President Trump brought it up I think he's probably right and I said this earlier\nThis president has shown the ability the unmitigated ability ability to to start a conversation in this country I don't care if you're on the left you hate him you're on the writing you love them or are you in between a you're not sure about\nHe can through one tweet or through one quick aides were of a question in an interview say something that will get us all talking and I think that's a good thing I don't know anybody in any side can say that's a bad thing that we're talking about the constitution and what the meaning of the fourteenth amendment is ... you know what I'm saying I think that's a good thing to\nWrite back to the phone lines is going to be ah let's see your line one's going to be rained on what's going on in Kansas rained ally\nYeah are you doing limited dream eyebrows up\nOn the fourteenth amendment I think it is for pretty plain and simple for me or not just solely for slaves I Believe if a woman coming here to the legal process it she happens to get\nPregnant along the way and then all of a sudden she gets in and then as the baby a few months later the baby gets to stay that way I look at it\nWell I agree the baby just to stay with us she came here legally or illegally I think she should leave the problem is and the reason why we have the issue that we have is chain migration and visitation I'm I'm a I'm a travel as Ted Cruz talked about we need to get rid of chain migration the babies born here\nI agree it's a citizen because that's what the fourteenth amendment says to me is the mother isn't it the mother is a citizen of wherever the hell she came from your baby on day but I don't know I I agree with you the baby can stay she's got to get out\nAnd we start making that the deal guess what they're not going to be coming here and having babies and leave their babies ear and by the way there is some rule that says you can't take your baby back with you to Honduras even if the babies the United states citizen I don't think so I never leave my baby mind I'd take it back with me\nYeah and why even have the legal process law if people are able to just dump their kicks off whenever they want you\nKnow I I wouldn't know listen I again the fourteenth amendment says what it says\nThe dare I say it carries should I say it oh go ahead it is what it is Mm [noise] yeah I can only get\nPaid is what it is so I ... it is what it is and again I I Believe is clear several times over the years saying again for those of you are new to the show\n'em and those of you are going to try which would lead fine I'm you come here illegally you drop a kid it that that is the the medical term right ... ... ...\nNow you know\nDrop the kids slap land and then there it is it's an American citizen congratulations\nBrave ... go your aspect\nTo Mexico to be that's the way it's gotta be it sounds ... and I cannot spell it out I'll spell it out as simply as I possibly can\nYou come here you have the baby the babies are citizen you've got three choices but the baby up for adoption leave the baby with with somebody who's in the United states it was a relative that easier legally or do you take the child back with you the idea that you had the child here and it's now a citizen which again I agree there's fourteen ... says so but\nThen you get to stay and the dad just to come here from wherever and then the great parents get the gum and then the tea on the tea I get to come and everybody else forget it dude no you had the baby here three choices take the baby back with you which is the humane thing to do is it's apparent\nLeave the baby here up for adoption you never see again or give the baby to a relative of yours who's here in the United states legally that's very simple we should make that the law and you'll see a decrease\nPeople coming across the border and dropping the kid um and and the getting all these benefits that will stop that magnet will go away but instead we're having an argument about the actual fourteenth amendment\nIt says what it says\nNow let's do something that makes sense for the safety and security and for the future of our country at the same time we work\nOn possibly altering this amendment it's a editing nine four one package editing nine four one Seventy four seven Joe ... dot com he wants to be the next governor or the great state of uh of Michigan he's a Republican attorney general bill ... and he's a real shootout we come back we're going to hear from him right here on the Joe ... show\nThat's the key thing is and then the question from Michigan is it as hey are you a better off today than you were eight years ago you know an answer is yes and so let's not go back to the last decade\nHe's a candidate for ah for governor the great state of Michigan he's also the current attorney general Republican bill shooting bill how close are you watching the uh betrayed hum I was going to see war is literally trade wars the the the trade negotiations between\nCanada and and the United states specifically because many people don't notice the Michigan border with Canada\nDairy is huge in Michigan Canada's been ... been terrifying the dairy from Michigan to the tune of almost three hundred percent how close you are you watching that because I Know that the other side I'm guessing your competitor feels this way has a problem with the with the president trying to even things up\nBut you know what the president is trying to do is rebalance trading relationships and get a better deal kind of a better deal for Michigan into and you know first he cut taxes for America and are Republicans in Congress in Michigan which means we're moving their production of the Rand truck\nFrom Mexico to Michigan neuron did that happen before it's remarkable and now he's trying to rebalance trading relationships because because tags the or you know the manufacturing worker in in in Michigan was left out of this or you know there's a global economy when the elite is a\nUh in New York and the west coast are enjoying themselves but we had to all and die shops closing down and then we have people lose their jobs and so now a President Trump wants to rebalance relationships get a better deal\nAnd with respect to agriculture you know I got I received the endorsement of the Michigan Farm Bureau which is a huge uh have your cultural organization and and so on their guy and I'm going to be a are working a governor for a a farmers across the state of Michigan and I want to milk producers to get a better deal a fair deal\nI Love you brought up automotive and again is ... the Republican who's the attorney general currently he wants to be your next governor of the great state of Michigan by the way I still have a house in Michigan so you'd be might governor to along the\n... what county ... county okay I won't ask the address again [laughter]\n[laughter] well hopefully hopefully my tax code on bill hopefully my ...\nWell you will because I'm I'm gonna have to eliminate the grand old ... income tax increases on about jobs just to take paycheck agenda and that's been a a a tax increase it was supposed to have been temporary is gross Michigan families and small businesses are eight billion dollars so\nIt was a quote into effect and uh well uh we're going to say to that and getting the color Michigan a big pay ...\nSo absolutely and again you brought up automotive and I think the simple question is will be asked of the residents of the voters of Michigan do you think these plants would be coming back\nHad the corporate rate not been lowered these bonuses that went out to workers these increases and pay the went up to workers those are because of Republican or conservative values\nAnd the idea that if government gets out of the way business can flourish employees can flourish more people more jobs more stuff why is that lost on people bill\nWell you know it's part of this communication and I try to remind folks remember eight years ago Michigan was on the map where on life support emergency room\nWe've rebounded of and now we've got to build on the success of the last eight years and go forward and the ... are there to draw a radically different uh drastically different people\nI Want to take a short and cut taxes and our auto insurance rates and\nAnd Gretchen what she wants to raise taxes wants a government run health care which remain\n... a barrel Castro choose your doctor and how do you pay for a a government run government dominated healthcare by your taxes so she's here she's going to Jack up your taxes you won't be able to choose your doctor or that's the road to the last decade\nPart too we can't it's too risky it's too risky and that's why we're going to go forward with Bill shoot\nI Lived there fulltime when John ... was the governor and you're right he he won by very small margin but when he left there was a surplus in the government taxes have been lowered he was talking about\nYou know having people drug tested before they get some sort of a social handout from the government he was actually looking out for our tax dollars are we are being taken out of our paychecks is that the kind of governor you want to be used while you're looking for a tax dollars make sure that we give a climate and the great state and the great lakes state of of more employment more businesses coming back\nBut you got it and I'm running for governor because I Want Michigan to grow and this is about us being competitive and winning again and beating the other states in America that have a more growth and more people than we do uh I don't want Michigan and the smaller shrinking or less significant state we\nOnce had Nineteen members of Congress will have Thirteen after the next census and that's a evidence that to other states are growing faster than we are at our expense and uh you know that's not sustainable I Want Michigan\nAnd be a place where people are they call their home or not a vacation state of place they visit so we need to grow our economy grow a population a and and improve our demographics so we go forward that's that's what it's all about\nAnd the reason people are living as ... it's not because it's not a beautiful state it's an amazing state but people are leaving because of the jobs left\nIn ... as the jobs come back and they had been slowly but surely doing so and as you get more conservative policies for people like you I Believe they will come back one last question it's built Judy I'm S. C. H. U. E. T. T. he's running for governor\nOf the great state of Michigan he's the Republican he's also the attorney general right now and he's done an amazing job I talked to ten packs and a lot about you and you've done an amazing job as the attorney general's\n... the good guy no he is ready for Texas\nUsing job as attorney general ... guy go he is ready for Texas has for shorter and generally Texas yeah\nI'm a ... before I let you go to the polls right now they're tightening you're right she's still up a little bit but it's within the margin of error in in in a lot of polls what do you do to pull this out you've got a week\nBut you know what it's our message and it's all about how Michigan goes for the two big questions from Michigan you want to go forward or you want to go back and again that this factor in fear of the economic policies the extra\nFar left policies of a a ... a scare people and as I say it's Gretchen wherever you governor or you're you're in danger of losing her job and then the question also is a better off today than you were eight years ago answer's yes and so let's not go back and it's all about okay\nI'm Gretchen what will raise your taxes go see if he's going to cut your taxes that's pretty clear to me\nYeah I I couldn't agree more bill we appreciate your we wish you the best uh let's talk again very soon and hopefully you could pull this thing out I'm feeling good about it\nUnless you were going to land a can be a nail biter I'm asked them or you know and just like Trump won by ten thousand or the other one by Seventeen thousand so they're strapped you're on your seatbelt here we go we're going to put it in next celebration and now we're going to win this thing\nIs the age either the great state of Michigan it's built Judy running for governor he's the Republican go and vote for Bill we appreciate you\nYeah thank you so much bags and grateful attract you sit back after this and the Joe ... shows the writer [noise]\n\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy generic mattress built for everyone else he'll actually built asleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the interest to match your body type and sleep references to the perfect mattress\nWhether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper like a plush or affirmed bed which he looks there is no more guessing or confusion\nJust go to ... dot com slash bags take their two minutes sleep quiz they're going to match you to a mattress that will give you the best leap of your life you'll excuse even split the mattress down in the middle providing individuals weren't needs and feel preferences for each side they have a ten year Warren G and you get to try it out for a hundred nights\nRisk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off all mattress orders get up to a hundred twenty five dollars off at ... dot com slash package that he'll sleep dot com slash P.

brought to buy the republic of Azerbaijan from food energy to a knowledge economy\nThe republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass and is a region well worth exploring we go immediately to a region that at this moment is undetermined that is Florida the state of Florida has a column up\nAbout the contest between Ron dissent is\nThe Republican Andrew Andrew Gillum the Democrat\nAsking from some very good questions about who is Andrew Gillum and is the state of Florida that voted happily for Donald Trump is it about to move towards the Obama part\nOf the Democratic party or are they going for the Bernie Sanders even more radical than that part of the Democratic party Liz can we read Florida is it just going to be a different state every time there's an election [laughter]\nThat's a really good question Andrew Gillum that Democrat candidate was a surprise winner in the primaries that were held at her and when that was six weeks ago or so\nThat no one really saw it coming he's the mayor of Tallahassee and a really there had not a whole lot was known about him is an attractive African American a good Baker is kind of a nearby la channel I guess you'd say\nOr or mold a but really no one knew huge amount about this guy a ... including the fact that there was a corruption scandal\nSwirling around Tallahassee where he's mayor ah for the last year or so and it's a pretty serious one and one of his former campaign workers a has been subpoenaed to share a ... he was um [noise] caught up Gillum to an FBI\nEh they he was um [noise] caught up Guillen to an FBI a investigation and where they ... it and it it's it's complicated but basically Gillum was has not been named in any indictment or subpoena\nBut he's pretty darn close to a lot of seeming bad stuff that went on having to do naturally with real estate development and pay off a ... and honestly I I have no idea what the outcome of that will be as I say he is not personally been mentioned but it's very close to his office which I think is\nTainted his um his run but more importantly I think for the voters of Florida I I have to say I sort of shake my head about this Florida is a booming state one of the fastest growing states in the country one of the lowest unemployment rates\nAre under Governor Scott they've created an enormous number of jobs more than the country average\nUh and it's just an ... of course from New York and I don't need to tell you there is a steady exodus heading to Florida because of the low tax\nRates there and the fact that it's a great place to die for me but the low inheritance rate and all the rest of that stuff\nUh you know a lot of wealthy New Yorkers make it their business to move to Florida and when they retire so why Florida would want to change all that and that is what Gillum is promising higher taxes higher taxes particularly\nOn corporations are but higher taxes nonetheless this is a fellow who is funded heavily by George Soros and by organizations funded by George Soros he is not at all and the Obama lyrical low and in fact his way left of Obama honestly it is astounding to me that he has\nSo much traction in this race\nLet's look at the big picture of the Democratic party being astonishing please successful in other races where the logic escapes me\nFor example were were ended it does because of the economy will affect the frustration here for me to figure this out with political science the Republican Party has delivered free point five percent following four point\nTwo percent of GDP that that is supposed to to to dominate the conversation but it's not instead the conversation is turning obsessively about the conduct of Donald Trump is that the Democratic message is that is that the closing arguments Donald Trump that's it\nWell yes and I I mean that's exactly right if you can come up with any kind of coherent democratic platform that they're running on I really love to hear it because I don't think it exists\nA instead what you have is anti Trump favor um and and the problem is because the president is out there\nA ... you know presiding over these enormous boisterous rallies day after day after day weighing in on all these contests\nIn a sense that Democrats are responding to his presence in these races now I think he's doing the right thing I think he does those turn out I think he's out there reminding voters that voted for him you know our work is not done\nOn Obama did that in twenty ten do you recall those rallies in Philadelphia and Chicago he was always on the campaign trail with feverish attention talking about I remember particularly want don't give him the keys back big round the car into the ditch don't give him the ...\nAnd he ... he was extremely popular and the keys came back okay fine so\nAnd so but I don't remember making Obama the centerpiece of twenty ten that was entirely about Nancy Pelosi and health care about what the message and it's one in ten\nAnd twenty four gene where the Republicans held up quite firmly it was about jobs jobs jobs jobs I was the last midterm it wasn't about Obama although it was his administration\nThe puzzle here is what is the Democrats promised to do\nIn this closing argument I guess all they've promised to do is remove Donald Trump that's ... that's the campaign promise\nWell actually as you know Thomas dire a wealthy Democrats backer has put a lot of money and is this race for candidates who promise to pursue impeachment the minute there in Congress I think there will be an effort to engage the president's\nAh Maxine Waters is going to be head of the financial services committee and as a committee chair she will have the opportunity to subpoena records and financial transactions all kinds of stuff\nFrom the president's so she has promised to move to on impeachment uh hearing process as quickly as possible and I'm sure she'll do that\nI think that that this regime than a little bit child in you and I agree\nThat Republicans should be out there talking about the growth of the economy on tax cuts the deregulation but the Republicans are doing it they are so cowed\nBy the ... of Democrats particularly about the tax cuts how it was all going to the corporations and wealthy people that they're really intimidated and they and and maybe some can't connect the dots I don't know but it's very disheartening\nThat they have this weapon of the economy and they're not using it\nLives peek a columnist at Fox News columnist up the hill I'm John bachelor this segment of the global business report brought to you by the Republican ... from food energy to our knowledge economy the Republican ... and the Caspian Sea bass in the region well worth exploring this is the John ... show\n\nHardy divided I'm Lisa ... Fox News at least on one issue as President Trump moved to end a policy that grant citizenship to children born in the U. S. whose parents are here illegally in an interview\nWith actually often HBO President Trump said he's preparing an executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship for children born into us to non citizens house Speaker Paul Ryan speaking with Kentucky radio station W. V. okay to the president can't do that with an executive order\nWill you obviously cannot do that you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws decorative actress\nSenate Judiciary committee chairman Republican Chuck Grassley says he will review the president's executive order but Susan generally Congress should take the lead Fox\nAn argument is always better John when it is benefitted by the facts and at some point are critics will have to acknowledge the fact\nI wanted to add to that about blue collar Larry because I Do small business reporting all the time and what I'm told repeatedly these last week says that small business confidence has never been higher\nAnd these were the first people to endorse or embrace raw Donald Trump early in the campaign cycling I puzzled about it what did they know that every all the smart guys don't know they're still\nVery confident about the economy and they're the ones who do the majority of hiring and all the jobs in America and the job creation\nBut I think you know going back to the campaign a candidate Trump argued again and again that the war against businesses over\nAnd the war against success is over and if you keep more of what you earn or risk or invest or you will be rewarded rather then penalize that's the beauty of the lower marginal tax rates and you know two years later that's what we are seeing\nSteve you have a question about business investment please\n... about this because I was just at a at a conference today and it's and I'm a comprehensive recording our a lot of the good news that letter was talking about\nSome of the skeptics Larry and I love your kind of response to this or saying well gee you know ... there were some really bad news in this latest report and the things that they said because I Believe that that's something like that then I'll basically four percent growth now\nBut they were saying they were very disappointed with the business investment adverse bad that shows that the corporate tax cut isn't working and so on and and I don't know if I had all that question very well but I Wonder you know what you'd say that\nWell you know I think there were some glitches in that number I'm which will probably show up in a much stronger number in the fourth quarter in my show up in subsequent revisions um for example ah\nIn the core cap acts core business investment spending shipments and cute three were up seven point seven percent\nAnd orders are up eight point five percent both that ad rates now that doesn't really jive with uh the slowdown in business equipment which was only zero point four percent\nAnd I think that which will be straightened out uh in in cue for if not sooner but a key point here the national association that business economists nay\nThey are reporting a new record highs and profits and profit margins\nAnd I'm profits are are the lifeblood of the economy\nAnd so I reckon as long as profits hold up and they are they may be having another shelf life here that's gonna really propel investments spending business investment spending which also the prophet increases are are they to function of the a reduction in marginal tax rates\nLarry our our consumers are driving this that's the way it should be right we're ... the ... oh\nNo no I don't think so only in this quarter only in this quarter jock I'm In the prior quarter as it was\nBusiness investment in fact most of this expansion of the Trump expansion is coming from the business side uh although it was sloppy in this quarter and you're right a consumer spending was stronger but actually when you look at the statistics um [noise]\nThis is investments fixed investment up six point four percent over the past year a consumer spending a three percent so this really is a business investment driven and that's the healthiest because we have not seen this\nSince the mid to late Nineteen nineties and you can have a true\nStrong economic recovery such as we are experiencing if it's just consumer spending after all supply creates its own demand business investment create more capital per worker\nWhich will lead to higher productivity and stronger real wages\nAnd again and the trend line a that is precisely what is happening\nLarry Kudlow is the director of the national economic

that focused on the made an upset\nIn winter of twenty fourteen leading to the tearing a part of Ukraine between Don Bass in Crimea and between ... and the western part of Ukraine that begins our

Vladimir putting in the Kremlin commit their forces\nTo the Assad regime and working with the Iranian regime then we go to the\nFrontier along the Russian frontier when NATO gets involved in making dire predictions of what will happen if and when the Kremlin turns its hybrid warfare so called against the Baltic states the re arming of Poland the\nFresh Trump Administration taking the Obama

O. J. shouted to the rooftop Hillary Clinton shouted that Donald Trump as ... as a Kremlin agent with no evidence that the world we live in the new Cold War is a real estate and with farcical elements but\nThere is damage here and Steve I Want to begin with legitimacy what does the allegation a week before the midterm do for the legitimacy of the American government\nWe talk we talk about the potential and put a implications\nRamifications of this Russia the allegation that the Russians were manipulating the outcome of our elections in the case of Trump in two thousand sixty and as you say the media's pushing this now in regard to the house congressional elections\nAnd on November ... so we knew and I talked about this a little bit and it is a subject in my book war with Russia this question mark after it and\nThe more I think about this I don't see this going away in the sense that as you said damage is being done we need that sense of process so here's what I asked myself and it's it's more a question\nThat an assertion but I think our folks listening ought to think about it all\nIf you say\nAnd you say it's for two and a half years\nEven though you can't produce and the evidence that the Russians may have put Trump in the White House would have been done to the institution of the American presidency because it won't end with Trump\nBecause the idea that the Russians could do this the Kremlin could do this and now they're saying the Chinese may want to do it but that a foreign power\nCan choose our present tense surely dean legitimize is the presidency as an institution to cast a shadow on it or let's go to what's going to be the normal reaction to the next Democratic president is going to get the same kind of stuff thrown at him or her\nThat the Democrats have been throwing at Trump it isn't gonna end so what we have to ask ourselves\nThey've been throwing at Trump it isn't gonna end so what we have to ask ourselves is first we get a almost a deal with a gentleman rising up our elections as a process\nBeginning with the presidential wanting to sixteen now going into next Tuesday these questions have been raised so I have no doubt that if\nThe Republicans hold the house all\nRemain a majority that segment of the Democratic party and its media will be saying that the Russians were behind this or that the Russian ... you know to the scale because they wanted to protect Trump so where do we then have a shadow over the presidency and over\nThe next Congress that's fairly serious in my mind mine John and then that raises another question in my mind\nIf these people take this seriously what are they saying about American voters\nAre on the American people now in democratic theory and you don't have to be a political philosopher didn't notice the bedrock a representative democracy is that the agency\nLies with voters and voters will make a rational oh functional democratic decision and you live by their decision you would agree with that all that looked like the Oscars yet again with the premise\nThat go on from there to talk about institutions are representative government but you can't have institutions are representative government [noise] uh and less you have people to elect otherwise and some\nAuthoritarian systems have outwardly democratic parliament for example correct but they're essentially appointed and control it's called managed democracy\nBut a real democracy and representative democracy is the one we know you need the voters but if the voters are said to be as they are in these Russia gate allegations\nForever susceptible to a hundred thousand dollars worth of ads out of about forty billion ads bought or whatever it was\nA by some Russian wacko social media operation in St Petersburg what is that saying about the American people\nI mean we kind of think this through at about people you and I John who lived are higher life inundated by advertising on television that we don't believe for a Mac I mean I Know that if I buy that beautiful car\nIt is not going to get me all those beautiful women that are leaning over the car I mean we have been raised to be intuitive leap skeptical\nOf the things that come to our attention I think that's fair to say I mean advertising agencies try to manipulate us but we know what's going on so to say that the Russians are capable of Being American voters\nYou're saying something less about the Russians and about our own people but that is what these Russia gate allegations\nAre saying it is striking to me Steve remembering the election and just I was participating as a reporter and I was watching on Twitter I could tell when the Russians were on line because it was morning time in Petersburg so I Would often wish them very good morning in Russian\nAnd they would never respond because they didn't have a sense of humor they were working for money I understood that but it wasn't a threat it was kind of cheering\nThat they were so keen on trying to influence us with awkward statements like Tennessee for Trump you know that kind of thing right [laughter] I really just very persuasive very thank you very much picked a real hard state their work for the Republicans imagine ... so I I it never occurred to me that it would be\nIt would be concocted to be a threat to democracy it seemed it seemed kind of sweet of them that they want to get it that they that they wanted to get in on the process because they don't have anything comparable\nAndme me cause we talked about this I won't go into it but historically whatever meddling or interference the Russians did into sixteen\nWas part of a long history of ... of all it let's turn to that just moments the press about back meddling in their elections when ... when we come back professor Stephen F ... new book is war with Russia question mark I'm John bachelor\n[noise]\n\nHardy dividing I least sound like ...

I mean it's preposterous that this guy if this broken soul down in Florida I\nDecided somewhere for some reason to post a story about sure yet what are they care about Syria we don't know yet what matters is is he got it out of the New York times Washington Post\nI I Want to look at it Shapes Our media and ... and when people walk up to me in the street and say ...\nUh is putting gonna decide is putting gonna throw the house to the Republicans the Democrats they aren't kidding and where did they get this they got up from the New York times the Washington Post or they got it from cable TV which gets their segments\nFrom the New York times in the Washington Post that's why it matters that's one of the ... the John bachelor's so you are kind of alternative source of news ... news analysis\nBut you only got so many million viewers a ... or a big country and a lot of people do believe this stuff not like\nI Want to go to what is to be done with these allegations a one version of what has to be done is censorship\nYeah how we see that underway right now in all directions because the social media sites are acting uh intermittently and haphazardly and non transparently to censor or weed out Russian interference there are other things they're doing but we're ... I'm concentrating on Russia right now Russian interference\nHow that actually affects the election I Can't tell you but I Do know it sets up the possibility that whoever loses on Tuesday is going to blame the Russians\nIt also sets up the possibility that there is never going to be a safe space for elections in America in perpetuity if this if this theme continues deep our elections are always going to be vulnerable we can't shut the door fast enough\nAnd we have to find another way to go forward as the government which means distrust the mob trust the leadership that's where we're headed Steve trust the people who know best\n... that's what worries me among other things and that's a theme and a Bible\nAll that whereas this leading up to me and you got to get the language right Russia gave has been an elite project yes and one of the things I Do in the book is I trace it back to the CIA and Brennan maybe even before to sixteen and the story to the extent that it's\nKnown I put in the book I don't claim to know at all because you never know everything that the intelligence services do that's why they're called intelligence services I guess but the problem here is is that they set into motion these narratives about what's going on\nPeople believe them then we come to a moment\nAs we know it's a week away we're one week away from the election and as you say uh the losers are going to blame the Russians they will we've already have that in off year elections\nShow where how do we get our elections back now one thing we do you and I talked about it I won't go into it at great length but I heard something the other day that reminded me of it [noise] we did a broadcast maybe more than one on the long history of American meddling in Washington elections are Russian politics\nSure nine ... Nineteen Ninety six we throw money at it\nWhat we can start with Woodrow Wilson who sent troops to ride a bike ride Russian so I ... I mean it's a century long and we've kinda gotten used to it but\nThe problem is we don't recognize as Russia gate phenomena and Israeli is rather modern day minor episode and this behavior somebody said the other day I'm not going to say who was because he's very famous uh I don't think he's alive ball but he's held a lot of really important positions [noise]\nShe said that we would that that he was in the Clinton and the uh\nUh the Clinton Administration and he remembers that at that time when Yeltsin was up for re election in Nineteen Ninety six right yeah and he was like seven percent in the polls\nSo Washington mounted a big campaign to save you also but the one thing we didn't do this guy said is the main grievous against Yeltsin was he hadn't pay pensions in two or three years\nAnd we didn't help them pay pensions that's absolutely not true\nIt's it's a matter of public record Clinton got ... and and the international Monetary Fund loan I Can't remember if it was four billion or a billion dollars but it was specifically so Yeltsin could pay pensions and unpaid wages and that was arranged\nBy that and that we are critical and you'd establishments fact when we talked about ... and it's the threat of the pensioners said on that middle and make the Kremlin tremble\nIf we think about it and we think about our parents and our grandparents and the rule the Social Security is played ... played in this country for for for decades and we think about how pensions today or political subject in the United states and the other way in Russia to uh [noise]\nYou could almost I have to double negative you could not intervene more intimately and another country's politics\nBan by intervening in the pensions issue and I'm getting half yes I mean how intimate that is to the survival families and yet we did it now people might say well it was a good thing that Yeltsin won because of the communist would've come back to power could say that but to deny what we did\nTo have amnesia about uh are very intimate intrusion and a Russian elections and then get all round up by a handful of rushing social media oh\nOh what a post in American electoral cycles seems to me to be strip of all of his ... at the we have very dangerous we have\nTo turn to the other elections where the Kremlin is accused of bad acting I'm speaking with professor Stephen F ...

have to pass it to find out what's in it\nOr to what extent do you believe this could have been the rhetorical rambling on the part of ... feet below sea\n[noise] well no I think I think what she did is give a window to her so I think you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party\nBasically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it and we're basically engaged\nIn a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting the American people were told\nBy the president and by the Democrats that if they like their doctor they could keep their doctor they remember that eat Italy yes they were told that their premiums would go down\nI don't know if they ... expressly discussed the duck doubles\nBut I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go a phenomenally um higher to the point where the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation with Obamacare and and of course\n... I don't think the American people were honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry\nWent as if they use the healthcare system in the United states is similar to the legal system in the United states it has lots of problems are legal system has lots of problems ... and the health care system has lots of problems but when we compare it to other

demonized\nUm and there was that there were just a lot of prefer getting going on in order to achieve again the ... the main thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy of the Democratic party we look at ... you know the terms looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre as we've been hearing a number of things about the people of the most notably a Christians assuming from Arizona Claire McCaskill from Missouri are quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at

hold a statement for the uh the Congress up there to put this on their forehead so that each of them can read it and says are a little respect the toward each other as you'd want respect you have to ...\nYeah well there's certainly that's a that's a would be nice to add I think at this particular time your thoughts James ... about the the tone of the political rhetoric of the day\nYeah and I think that sums up what David is trying to say and that's something I I think all Americans would like to see 'em a little more decorum and dignity among each other\nBut basically you know with that

only right\nOn what he is as we speak live all Hallows eve eve\nTo uh take note of of Halloween and the particular to a talk with Hollywood executive president and chief data strategist I'm headed media twentieth Century Fox Julie regroup to talk about her book the ghost photographer thank you Julie\nWell how are you have to tell you something where I come from which is rural Oklahoma I grew up with about thirty Jim those\nAh yeah well I grew up not far from you in southwestern Missouri and if you grow up with the name Jim both have him in that part of the country you better get used to Jim boat real fast [laughter]\nOh yeah now you're now that that makes all the difference in the world I think in your community status if you're a gym\nOh absolutely oh yeah elevated me I think maybe a point to have on me started quotient there [laughter]\nSo you found your way to uh to Hollywood and the subtitles or the goes photographer a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of uh make believe published by a Adrian in live in I Believe\nYes which is that part is Simon and Schuster\nYeah ah ... what exactly are we talking about here in terms of ah the ghost photographer\nYou know I I Will tell you that at the heart of the book is actually a transformational and Journey Through grief\nAnd they had when I lost my mom to all the time ours um I was devastated and even five months after that I lost another very dear friend and tragically and a car accident and not long after I started saying goes to photograph\nAnd not long after I started seeing\nGhost and photograph where\nYou know like you where we come from this guy that sound like you know help us focus and and I wasn't much of a believer I was actually\nYou know I was actually done this I didn't believe it all I I was very skeptical and that when it started to happen to me things really\nReally shifted they started to change 'em you know I think that when you are grieving\nUm that you know you're in a in a bit of a chaos and and your belief systems can shift and I think that's what happened and then not long after that is when I started getting some of the psychic powers or I could see them and hear them and feel them and even smell them\nWho has written a ... book the ghost photographer Julie ... our guest and uh she has a put some considerable fought\nAnd the imagination into this ... what's the uh the most uh I guess a scary or a realistic thing you've ever seen in this particular pain\nWell at the really great question because there certainly is things that have been scary that I've seen and um and there's things that are scared that experience that actually didn't say\nI think that I had at one point I'm In the house I made back out I think after if you will the door kind of crash down into the other side for me\nUm had a lot of ghost if you will that I'm kind of entered the house and we had heaters turning on by themselves light\nOf and computer rated it was it was absolutely insane and and so that was probably more frustrating but probably the scariest thing was the first ... said I I I took a picture of because it was\nThe idea of it actually scared me and this is where the Hollywood comes into play where students that may hold her guys and so I'm thinking to myself oh no have I open the portal\nAnd am I going to get sucked into it and you know start screaming out for Carolyn or something I I I really was petrified um I have I have seen um some some scary\nScary goes that look like they've been beat up a\nGhost I had no idea\nI didn't I think there would beat up before they crossed\nOur lives\nYeah and so there's not like I had a black guy and like a a fat lip and so yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for me 'cause I didn't know what the heck it happened\nIt's Hollywood doing more of this now you had this return to the Halloween the movies with\nA a a\nCurtis jama Jamie Lee Curtis Curtis yet are we going to be a return to those good old days of the of the scary this and the Freddie Krueger that sort of thing\n[noise] you know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy's face in blonde and have figured out how to make 'em really commercial um horror films\nAnd and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we the view these things anymore ... are the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading near the future\nAds for I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and and my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to storytelling at home is muted compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk\nYou might have a smile cross your face but if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud your body chemistry changes it actually releases endorphins and so you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sat and watched things by herself\n[noise] the the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various a revenue streams uh theaters for example uh get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do\nNot think so they do\nUh does Hollywood kind of data but if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater bulls in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and the and the candy or twelve dollars a candy bar or does the does the bill producer get a cut of that that's where the ...\nSellers the candy bar or just the the the the the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nI'm not that I'm aware of\nWhat you'd be where I Would agree\nYeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nKnow All right uh in terms of of the uh\nThe the creativity the goes to a Hollywood productions it seems to be the some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days go knock it to the TV shows or even less will surely feature movies just seem so to me those are the highest levels of ... per\nPer second of air time if you will go into music videos and commercials\nYou know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for second on something like um you know Star Wars movie very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects than it is anything else\nDoes ... does Hollywood depend too much on affects or we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got the great ... computer graphic or a a special effects year long as you're on the grill light and magic on your side can you sell the public anything\nIt now you can't you you can't sell the public and then I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into that the data side of things is to is to understand the customers more and there was a day when you could just make them moving in but it go see it\nUm and that this was probably more like twenty twenty ... Twenty years ago um but now people are smart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that I said listen I from what I've experienced and I and I had to put it you know to kind of start with that because\nI think ... everything and it for every movie in Hollywood but no movie\nNo script ever starts out to be a bad movie you know and it all\nGone with the wind or Citizen Kane discard\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script they might ... not totally confident in but it turns out to be a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects you know some of our most successful movies and the ones that I've personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single ... um special effect in any of those films\nUm Slumdog Millionaire was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I still think there's room you know for those films that don't at least I Hope so because those are some of our our best stories\nIs an article of faith among the good with the people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood has automatic you'll you'll be left wing of politics preaching to the rest of us you disagree\n[noise] God is it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I I don't think that\nThat is fully accurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us might might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and yeah I'm a girl from Oklahoma\nI grew up at his ... and a Republican household um but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is how politicized stories had become because movies like hidden figures should never be considered politicized because there was nothing political about that movie\nThe anyway a fascinating tale and we thought that on Halloween or virtually Halloween\nThat we should hear from Julie ...\nWho is a president GPA this rather just ahead of media twentieth Century Fox\nTo talk about the ghost photographer Hollywood executives true story of discovering the

called a lazy portfolio because it never changes his position you're stuck with whatever percentage of stock it says to have and whatever percentage of bonds that says have\nRight now so stocks are looking like they're not going to be making very much in the next year or two and bonds are going\nTo be suffering from the increase of interest rates so people need to know how inexpensive it is

I'm\nFor that matter killing any innocent people but let's stick with that first that is just ... beyond belief\nSystem ... reprehensible I mean I can use all kinds of wars doesn't bring the victims back in ... the the hate I think moving forward and the question of what do you do I talked about this than another hour and the show\nI had a conversation with one of my buddies in Los Angeles to think of Los Angeles and we talk about gun debate and all that and which is not the place for that but he said that in his church\nThey have people that have concealed carry 'em and that they agreed to during every service somebody two to three people\nWould be there who are certified and um practice with their weapons they spectra and they would be in a church in case the worst happen from ... that we even have to think that\nBut moving forward there may be more people that think that way where they either get security or they have to lock the doors um which is equally as that and you know here's the bottom line of people in Pittsburgh we wrap our arms around you there's vigil being held for them there's money being raised to comfort that's being served up\nJust again I'm\nOn an outrageous range of the range of things to happen and the people in Pittsburgh are reacting um\nYou know hatred can't we can have you feel that we're the time that you saw a lot of the Pittsburgh game that Pittsburgh Steelers winning their game but the focus so much for the focus on thinking of the poor\nPeople the victim that that ... that were were slaughtered and that of course people are coming together to\nRally around the folks are the kind of world we live and that's the kind of people we are in the United states and I hope that that's not forgotten and all of this on the table and sanity and hateful stick twist and a man's mind that\nYou know is now accused of this and charged with the terrible\nThings that nobody would respect thing\nRight they things ending the life of people who live long lives and we're not expecting you know to get the phone calls about their grandparents people weren't expecting that were in their fifties the two brothers I mean yeah it's an awful so I feel like\nYou know we need to and people are choked up people can barely talk a SWAT Team except for the um\nThe Pittsburgh synagogue gunman told crop that he wanted to kill all Jews to die he wanted them to die and it choked up so so many and we had three hate filled kind of crime three hate filled sucked back that have\nCaused havoc to other people there was the grocery store I haven't even mentioned that and I'm One of my favorite states Kentucky Jefferson town Kentucky just outside of Louisville and it you know it's um\nThink about it there was a guy who's banged on the door first\nChurch and tried to pull it up and couldn't pull it up and couldn't get inside\nBecause then he went to a Kroger store he shot to people both African American the first was sixty nine fifty nine year old Maury Ballard who was with a twelve year old grand on the ground from their uncle you're buying a poster board I don't think about this for a school project really\nTo second or a fifty seven year old woman who was killed in the parking lot\nAnd the guy fled I'm the mayor there that I'm\nPicking heartbroken an angry I Would feel that way about any act of violence and cruelty and this guy had a history of mental illness made racist threats repeatedly called his ex wife they end more all kinds of\nUm things are coming out about that because of course you look into the history and want to know what could possibly\n... possible that happen and what would\nYou describe somebody could do that to Gregory Bush fifty one years old I'm fifty one year old white men would try to do that what what does it what what what pushes in that direction\nAnd then we had the whole bombing thing and the fifty six year old Florida Man these things are so I act and he mailed fourteen and I thought it was Thirteen now they're saying fourteen a pipe bomb they didn't detonate but they were real and\nUm his hatred obviously was there and then the one we've been talking about the gunman and into the synagogue is really really rough\nWeek a couple of days early for that stuff that stuff that we don't want to happen here in the United states that agreement not caring for the way\nI'm from the rhetoric goes all that fine but to have this happens you know I mean terrible absolutely on describe all bets it describes will\nMove on to something else to talk about something else it's likely mean Halloween is coming up in a few days after Halloween is going to turn us around but we need something to bounce back on right what what are the positive stories\nOut there that are happening in the positive is what so many of you are doing reaching out in helping other people and then um\nThen we see that everyday examples of that and then pulling people out the neighborhoods and\nAnd I choose to believe really I Do that we really are a nation of people that are givers and care about other people and stronger and stronger than hate is something we are stronger than that the steel city is stronger than that were stronger than that you know\nAbsolutely absolutely I mean absolutely I'm going to I'm going to go in that direction with ah with everybody else I look look at a couple of other things\nYou know I talked about the Powerball thing and somebody asked me all he's if you want to power of all we should still do the show absolutely\nTen years on this show you think you're getting ready to me that easy of course no of course I'll hang around when the Powerball I'm not usually a lottery player but um I did I did\nI usually a lottery player but um I did I didn't play the lottery and just a little a little amount nothing big I see people that are pulling out big bill to play and I'm thinking maybe they know something I I don't know\nBut I but I'm not sure it's gotta be something different you write something different than than um than what I now with all I'm saying just move on to something else that that caught my attention\nAnd this is one of those stories where luckily I saw him in concert but bravo families Trump career Michael\nBoot Blu ray blue ... easy for me the same way\nHe has been talking about his son's cancer and you think of cancer and what cancer does watch one of the ball games over the weekend and the ads stand up to cancer and everybody\nOf course has assigned almost everybody touched by cancer any room you go in and some survivors but some that have family that didn't like in my family my mother who I adored\nDying of colon cancer five years ago when a grandmother I lost the kid from breast cancer so anyway I'm Michael Blue play did an appearance on stand up to a cancer epithet of care uh carpal karaoke on Saturday and he\nTalked to the games coordinate about a five year old ... who was diagnosed with liver cancer at age ... and he

together\nTwo sons and a daughter he said his extended family relocated to LA to be closer to ... to the sun now well while he underwent treatment and\nUm they take it day by day and he said we're all moved by what's happening and we have the best doctors and you know there's just focusing on their time with him he said he wasn't going to tour anymore and do any of that um\nHe you know they're focusing on hand and they're focusing on anything they can do with him and she ... you know again you just don't think of the three year old\nBut then of course we know that that to happen and that doesn't matter money I'm worried that her cancer cuts across all\nAcross all areas of life and income level and then there's just another\nExample of of that but I'm\nCertainly they don't want for

happening\nYeah kind of like that at garden there at back by like actor acts like at gone there when she was doing a residency and knew all these people wow everybody who was killed it was awful\nThat it was awful so the reaction in Washington because there's been a lot of conversation about uh not politicizing this and then Trump saying things except for what's the latest there\nWell the president tweeted out today or actually yesterday there is a great anger in our country caused by inaccurate and even and I was born in the news is fake news media that true enemy of the people must\nReporting the news is fake news media\nThe true enemy of the people must stop the open and obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage

fake media why she said they knew they know who they are\nBut they want to hear that is and and now I'm thinking what is and and as you said briefing first briefing we've seen in a while from Sarah Huckabee Sanders and I guess there's word that the president in the first lady are going to go to Pittsburgh right on Tuesday\nRight while the as the rabbi at specific activities welcome other rabbis a city that he's not but obviously it's the synagogues rap I got the important month\nYeah I'm In the meantime people are talking about what's happened with the three hate crimes are what we think are the hate crimes in the you know the Seventy two hours and the effect that might have in the mid term elections you you've been in Washington a long time what do you think\nWell I have been in Washington a long time but I don't necessarily know how troubled lectures are going to be affected what we do know for instance is that everybody said Hillary Clinton was going to win and it was going to be a landslide et cetera\nAnd they didn't know and I am a I work at a picture that set the only real poll is on election day and so we really don't know what effect is going to be a a well obviously have some effect and in terms of who wrote than what they vote for but other than that I cannot tell you\nLet me ask you this question um you grow up in a family especially with your brothers who you talked about current events everybody was active in what was going on in your community so I think that you all the fire for you to do what you're doing it did for me\nDo you think that younger people are more apathetic or do you think more will get out and vote against speculators\nWell it depends I think that millennials have the lowest voting record of any group ever\n... they don't tend to vote however generation is ... which is just now coming of age and they'll probably vote in the next presidential election we're probably won't be voting much in this election if any of this Generation Z\nFigure out what's your next move you know what what am I going to do and I've had long discussions with so many people on the show about that as you know and will do more of that\nAnd I've had them off the air the last couple of days about what our houses ... any kind of house of worship what are they doing and it seems that if they don't have some kind of a guard\nSome have opted to have people who have a concealed carry permits for them that they are there in the crowd like they would normally be there are a member of the congregation\nBut their arm their arm somehow you know they've they've they've got a weapon that if that were to happen they could a man or they could fire they would be there so\nThat becomes the question it's like the teacher question in Israel we notice the teachers are what their arms and why are they armed their arms because it's too dangerous for them not to be 'cause it's just the soft target\nAnd that's what places of worship are there are soft targets 'cause that's what we're talking about here on America Tonight\nWith me Kate to lenient I always say there's about what's going on in your backyard in mind and there's lots of conversation about that as there would be in and should be because there's massive concern over you know what I'm what next what do we do how do we defend ourselves\nTo we want to live in the world paranoid no but do we really need to be aware of our surroundings and the answer to that question is you do need to be around aware of your surroundings but if I'm In Pittsburgh and I'm In a suburb but I'm going to an early morning service where a few different things are going on in the synagogue\nI'm not thinking that this is right for us being a target today that you know somebody's going to come in and they're gonna they're gonna start shooting and\nUntil somebody called nine one one or the SWAT Team gets here and the police get here we're basically sitting ducks and we had to figure out what we're going to do if we're if we're away from where it's taking place there were just walking the door running away or what are we what are we doing\nUm sadly that's where we are so if that's where we are then ... what does the action going forward what is it that is the the thing that you have to do or think about doing are having conversations\nIn these congregations anyway about doing just like they are in school sadly we know and just like they are in other places that should be places that are safe including your own place of employment\nIsn't that should be places that are safe\nIncluding your own place of employment how often do we see sadly that where somebody's disgruntled somebody from the past comes in whatever the story is and\nIn an instance like that everything changes and we've had that conversation with people who have been\nTargeted we've had three different high profile cases where people and the ten years have come on with us to talk about the um horrific\nFeeling it is when you were trapped and you know you're trying to figure out okay what's the next move in fact\nHave you remember one of the last people we talked to told us about\nBeing at that D.C Navy Yard when the former navy reservist killed twelve people in that day\nAnd then was killed by the police that was back in twenty Thirteen\nAnd that the person we talked to we just talked to about a year ago who was in that situation and everybody was ducking recover and running and trying to figure out where ... you know where they were going to go and how they were going to tape it and they were just absolutely done at a navy\nShip yard at a Navy Yard wow and so whether it's where you work whether it's where you worship or whether it's where you send your kids to school it is sadly what you do have to contemplate\nAnd doesn't mean be paranoid looking for your shoulders think the world is coming to an end no it is sad times it's sad that that's what we have to contend with because as a kid\nI certainly didn't have to deal with that many of you listening to me you certainly weren't thinking that and I was in that in between air to where we weren't it wasn't Cold War so there wasn't any of the duck and cover drills\nUh so we ... I didn't have that childhood where you were concerned about that you know what your concern about the fire drills we get fire drills that's it\nThere wasn't any metal detectors there wasn't a concern about somebody coming in with a gun kidnapping somebody doing something else like that it was never a concern now it's not about is it a concern let's move the ball forward what do you want to do\nCongregations need to have those conversations that they have and with their\nFlock their parishioners to people who go there and worship um the the folks in the synagogues whatever whatever kind of worship that is\nAnd make that kind of decisions too we say as we are and just be more alert to we have some kind of protocol to we have a guard duty have concealed carry\nThroughout the services where there was one or two people who are who are already have the permits for that and feel secure are doing it and we just don't tell people who it is because why would you do that just let it roll\n'em and that I think is what's happening but I think that's happening more than one would suspect I mean so you gotta catch up with\nA sadly the reality of domestic terrorism\nAnd that and how it has altered our lives but to alter it permanently boy we sure don't want that that's for sure\nAnd the Pittsburgh mayor and uh the former rabbi at the synagogue thought that the president should wait till he's coming in on a Tuesday to Pittsburgh suspect says he prefers the term invaders to describe immigrants because he\nWas listening to the talking points on TV apparently great and Robert Bauer is his name is complained about the invaders six days before the shooting is what he was saying\nAnd uh he he wrote on social media his social media gab it is that I've noticed a change and people saying illegal not that now I say invaders I liked the\nUm the whatever it is he has forever changed the lives of lots and lots of families and\nYou know he minutes before eleven eleven days before he was writing all kinds of ah stuff about the caravan except for on on this social media site and then on October twenty seventh he goes into the tree of life synagogue\nAnd he wrote that post about invaders and said I'm going in and like in his\nAnti immigrant attitudes to his attack on the synagogue\nSo where yeah and apparently a the Hebrew immigrant aids society which helps refugees was one of the things that he was rambling about so\nUm that's what he said when he when he went in and and I mean just wow I'm I'm ... I mean just on believable as to what has happened here but\nAgain\nWe're placing the hatred with love and replacing the idea of okay we don't want this to happen again and not\nDoing something more proactive I think it's at this point that has to be that has to be something that's talked about in churches synagogues any place of worship whatever it is that half the half that has to be passed we talked about 'cause you\nCould be anywhere in this country that certainly was an area where you would not have expected that to happen was put it that way\nBut anything that the soft targets is a wide open [noise]\nGo to the mail bag next here on a piano\nThe dorm room the one\n[noise] one of the sea of radio\nABC News I'm Dave Pecker as President Trump toward the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting seen thousands of protesters marched through the streets and demanded that he'd go home\nWherever and Susan Rothenberg Presbyterian minister yelling at President Trump the president was just a few doors away during the tree of life sooner guard\nOr away those who marched toward the trio determined to show the president didn't want to research for we should do during the previews which would be worse than Fifteen minutes and ... percent of the law officers in the family would be to kill to be a coach it'd be senior\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan says President Trump can't and birthright citizenship on his own that would take a constitutional amendments\nPresident says he wants to do it by executive order the head of big Indonesian armed forces says the possible location of the crashed ... fuselage has been identified him a job to see this is ABC News\nBut imagine you it happens instantaneously but it wasn't ten minutes rampage and I know you described it as the first responders feeling just stick to their stomach and describing the scene is one of the worst that they've ever seen and of course is that way\nBecause you have exploding bullets that are hitting these people on what condition or the body then and there are dead and you've got eleven people that died and then you have other people that were seriously wounded as well\nAs to move on to 'em some more emails\nThat are just spanned the variety of a couple of different things including this one this one is from algae says ... I Hope\nYou are well in your world history need your voice the voice\nOf reason and an unreasonable world the pipe bomber I heard that the the guy from Florida had more bombs\nThat he was ready to send to more people is that true well they intercepted thanks for that they intercepted sports team packages and things are ... um\nBut they say that he had planned I guess from his rambling what he had written when he was working on that he had a list of about a hundred people he wanted to send packages to when he was going through the list\nSo this was just a handful of the people on the list and we certainly have named them well known for Democrats and\nHe told them that skaters after he was arrested in plantation Florida that the pipe bombs wouldn't have hurt anyone that he want to hurt anyone but they were real I mean they check them out and they were not fake bombs they were real bombs and they would have been a danger to somebody if they had gone off\nThey think he made the pipe bombs in the van\nAnd they're saying because they found the equipment to stamp the envelope the paper the printer everything the powder all that that he needed to do that and hours before he was arrested this strange he was playing doing the D. J. thing is playing music out of Florida strip club where he worked for two months\nHe went before that he was a male dancer or who the pizza delivery guy he had done a bunch of different jobs and two thousand and two he was arrested after Miami cops say he threatened to bomb or a power company saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nAnd he's been arrest you for a couple of other things as well so I mean now this is it because you figure with the charges he has to go through the due process\nBut looking at the charges and who he targeted he will certainly\nIf convicted go away for probably the rest of his life he's fifty six so there would be forty five forty eight plus years involved in that so yes he had a list of a hundred people\nThat does that he was looking at art this one is from ... and Joe ... says Kate\nI heard you tell the story about the um [noise]\nI heard on the street but all the people who were taking these selfies at your sanity and they were dying because of what they you know where they were going and the kinds of shots they were trying to get ... and how\nThey were falling to their deaths I just cannot believe that\nPeople are so dumb to do that they I guess the national park has to have signs up about taking selfies you know it was really sad there was an Eighteen year old he was a hiker and he was trying to get that and he was in it he was a kid that was visiting and he fell hundreds of feet to his death\nHe was at the top of that I comic waterfall that you always see\nAt and how awful just trying to get a shot I mean this is this the kind of where we live in right I Want to get the perfect and I get it like I get trying to get the you want to get the perfect photograph listen when we had cameras are trying to get perfect photographs right\nI mean I had a mother who's constantly and went behind you and clamp down your hair and it didn't look right and change things but we weren't standing on the top of waterfalls now because\nOf this one in one way tremendous opportunity to capture what surrounds you\n... there's this sort of risk thing or the not thinking and taking that extra step back\nWow be careful out there you're out at some of those monuments and you're looking at these great views just enjoy the view to take a picture of the view without making it a selfie how 'bout that sent me your thoughts ... radio dot com invading the man cave next ...

Senate freshmen would\nOK Now let's turn your attention to the house of representatives because you put together this incredible update on those individuals on their way to the one hundred and sixteenth Congress where do you want to begin\n[laughter] that's right well we have more than forty ... non incumbent house candidates who were very clearly favored to win on November the six because the primary for them in their districts was the key elections so many districts are so one sided that that's the real election and that what happens on Tuesdays really going to be a formality\nAnd so we're gonna have some big ... you know in in history in congressional history will have our first [laughter] you know that Texas Filipinos the first Texas Hispanic woman ever elected to Congress or they basically clinch their victories back in the march ... primary\nAnd we have kind of new members coming in like a unimpressed slowly in Boston who defeated my cup of walk into a twenty year in combat in Boston she is going to be a shoo in as well\nI Know who wants to run through your great report let me ask one dumb question is this election is going to be good for the president of the United states\n[noise] ah it's probably going to be either a probably not the best will be mixed decision because it seems like this is a tale of two elections Dems Democrats very well positioned to win control of the house obviously a big blow to Trump and Republicans\nBut Republicans may well hang on to the Senate majority just by the good luck I'm a very favorable map Republicans would like to increase that majority by winning states that a Trump won easily were Democratic senators are defending their seats and proper spending the last few days of the election traveling to many of those states\nGreg you give us any insight into the Senate race in Texas\nSo Ted Cruz against the Beto O'Rourke a better workers raise an incredible amount of money um although I Do think there probably emerge will return so that money you know the race thirty eight million dollars and a three month period although\nI Know I don't think any differently if his race to be raised Eighteen or twenty eight million dollars but the challenge in Texas is that it's still a dependable a Republican state there is a high ceiling\nFor Democrats in Texas I could see or getting forty six forty seven percent ... percent of the vote easily but getting the fifty percent plus one into this against the Republican incumbent it's still hard\nI mean this is important and that there's a lot of media coverage of tea may versus team be but you still going to win and we forget that you could win by one vote Mr O'Rourke is never really been close has the\n[noise] in a few surveys he's gotten with in I'd say the mid single digits\nOr hits they are very you know it's not like literally with a blue he doesn't get a blue ribbon he just doesn't win right\nThat's exactly right I mean for the cruise has been you know not great but it's been persistent and so I you still have to re cruises the as the favorite to win re election\nGive us an example of a congressional rage that has your attention and oh Kevin ... really looking at the ... district Lexington, Kentucky is one of his favorites what's your favorite Congress or raise for\nA congressional race for our listeners to watch as we get is we get closer in on that evening as well\nIt will be the Kentucky six raise the Kevin ... really this is great because of the candidates running but also because it has a six PM poll closing time eastern time so it's going to be kind of an early canary in the coal mine I'm looking at for races in Virginia I think one of my favorites there is congressman Dave Brat in suburban Richmond\nHum he defeated house majority leader Eric Cantor and a Republican primary for years ago now he's running for re election in the general election against a\nFormer CIA officer a Democrat Abigail Spanberger who's raised several million dollars in a race that would've been on a couple that Democrats would have been competitive in a just a couple of years ago\nWhat about that one I beg your pardon Greg so go ahead I was going to ask you about the race in Indiana the Senate race between Joe Donnelly the Democrat incumbent and Mike Ron what's the likelihood that this is going to end in a dead heat\nA dead heat right now it's one of the states that President Trump is going to be visiting and the eleventh hour of the campaign out Joe Donnelly a had the advantage of facing a flawed Republican opponent\nIn twenty twelve and now he's running on his record and trying to defeat the Republican Mike we're on a wealthy man and former state legislator tore\nIt generally poll closing state most the polls closed at seven PM\nThe former state legislator generally poll closing state most the bulls were closed at seven pm eastern and so that's one of the early Senate races election night will be watching very closely\nI mean ... brings up the idea that you know with these many elections or could be a number of of\nToo close to call election while I was thinking also not only not only of Indiana but also of Iowa rod Blum bright the two term incumbent he's got trouble\nIt's right I mean that's that's an interesting district in eastern Iowa Dubuque Cedar Falls Cedar Rapids\nIt's one of those districts I like to call a an Obama Trump district so voted overwhelmingly white middle class you know so that just goes to show that well a lot of districts were watching her and well educated suburbs there are some in rural America They're closely worth washing and that's one of\nMy district that Obama won but then swung the Trump who did well in Iowa\nAnd now it may swing back to vote for Democrats or advocate down or the Democratic challenger to Iraq glum\nJust quickly Nevada because wasn't that supposed to be the Democrats' best chance of picking up a Senate seat\nIt's one of their two best chances along with the next door Arizona a light pole closing time so it may be a while before we know Dean Heller the Republican incumbent right wins reelection but Heller is the only Republican seeking re election in the state Crump lost twenty sixteen but\nI Wonder however was elected and twenty twelve in his own right he did so as Obama was carrying Nevada so he has some crossover appeal there too and I I wouldn't count him out\n... very valuable thing cause so much with the good Kansas or to get to a six days away to the election and of course our election coverage which I I Love it and I for perjury for a global audience we do a lot more of a policy conversation an outcome conversation will do the horse race and all that with David West and leave your average but\nWell loans festival or NATO security it's like buying a house effectively you know there's a lot less ... than there is with bonds and the settlement process can take longer than a security a set of a couple of days it could take\nFive days or it could take several weeks to settle and also because there are fewer people who are buyers of loans the market is not as broad as the as the bond market\nIf that's the case and we take it that it is do you believe that there are many investors who put their money and their faith in loans and leverage loans but don't know the consequences or potential complications that you just described\nHere because I think when people think of alone and they tend to think a bank loan remaining they're very very safe they tend to think that they're a defense against right\nBecause the coupon rate will adjust if interest rates go up but what they forget about is the risk to principle which is always a in any bond it's also in any loans were so many lower quality loans uh there's a greater risk to principals ... than in previous\nYears with loans but there are so many lungs a layered over capital structure recovery value companies will be less than what you've experienced some previous cycles\nThat desire for these loans is backed by low interest rates for bonds would that be accurate\nYeah and also people who are afraid of rising rate things alone is a very attractive um however\nAnd uh well no because number one a lot of the new ones have loans has been in the lower part the quality market work more marginal issues previously they would have come to the high yield bond fund and create a default but uh so that is left high yield a little bit from some of the ...\nAnd the first week of November Nineteen eighty seven this reform argue you were in the industry we all learned about a thing called portfolio insurance are these loans the new portfolio insurance\n[noise] no I think it's just a loans are are responding to what the market has demand that the market wants more loans because people\nCome on march ... say are the market wants more yield it's always said if I can get thirty more bases points I'll be happy right every cycles like that isn't it\nYes but loans pay you less healed then gone oh God of the issue do you trade that off because you think you're the principal is better protected uh either default or in

twice in two thousand and eight and twenty twelve and Arizona has not\nElected a democratic senator has not sent a Democrat to the Senate since Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd the last time a democratic presidential nominee one there was Nineteen Ninety six which was a Bill Clinton so there's a history there but there are a lot of similarities between the states they share a border they have a large and growing Hispanic populations of somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty percent\nAnd there is a progressive base in both states to ... to be mobilized\nThis is a one of the races where President Trump is not campaigning\nWhat President Trump is campaigning for a Dean Heller in Nevada uh he recently went there he recently paid a visit to the state Dean Heller started off being a skeptic of President Trump said he was in Ninety nine percent opposed to him and the twenty sixteen election but more recently over the last year or so\nOr maybe a year and a half a after Donald Trump became president Heller has become more supportive of him he now ... alliance with the president\nAnd an effort to gin up his Republican base in Nevada\nMe while I'm\nBernie Sanders is at a rural and that of auto racing tell us about that\nBernie Sanders was recently in Las Vegas to campaign for Jackie rose and he appeared with a Rosen who is the Democratic Senate candidate there\nA to a crowd I was I was there actually last week when he was when they were campaigning together and she you know rattled off a slate a very progressive ideas that she's running on which includes gun control raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour\nProtecting young undocumented people and tackling climate change so she is not running away from the left\nA flank of her party she is trying to get these voters enthusiastic to show up and support her\nIs the way the west seems to be turning a characteristic of the west or is this something new\nWill both in Nevada and Arizona are turning toward Democrats mainly because of the demographic shifts are primarily the Hispanic population that's growing Hispanic tend to vote\nFor democratic candidates in big numbers and so you know any kind of population growth of growth among a growth in the electorate of this demographic helps the Democratic party\nOr both of these races then considered I'm dead heat so they both toss ups\nIt's funny you ask because there's a brand new CNN poll that's out and just the last hour that find both these races to be in statistical ties the Democrats in both\nStates lead the races by a small margins but you know they are these are statistically insignificant margins in the Arizona Senate race Kirsten Sinema leads by fifty one to forty seven percent and the Nevada Senate race a Jacky Rosen leads by forty to forty five percent so yes there are very close\nYou sort of touched on this ah earlier how important are Hispanics are in both the state's\nWhile they're extremely important and the way this breaks down depends entirely on their turnout levels so in Nevada Democrats have been successful at turning out to Hispanics and recent presidential elections which is why Democrats won the last three elections in that state\nBut in in Arizona they have not turned out and as big numbers\nAlthough still Hillary Clinton only lost that race by about three and a half points or lost that state by about three and a half points in twenty sixteen so the big question for Democrats I think the question I'm for them in terms of whether they win one or both states is can they mobilized Hispanics to show up to the polls because if they do they're in good shape\nAnd I'm just looking at your story here and I and and these two words just jumped out at me Trump score what what what is that why is that important than either of these races\nThe Trump score as a measure of by the website FiveThirtyEight dot com which is an auction forecaster and has all sorts of interesting and useful data\nI'm about elections and candidates and that I I found relevant because Carson cinema is running as a centrist she is highlighting you know I'm I'm plot from a moderate issues like helping people with preexisting conditions supporting veterans protecting the safety net like Social Security and Medicare\nSo hurt Trump's score which was you know\nSafety net like Social Security and Medicare so hurt Trump score which was you know she has the fourth most pro Trump voting record of any House Democrat\nAnd that bolsters her argument that she is not a partisan a Democrat who constantly votes with Nancy Pelosi\nOn so you know that's that's I think part of the images that she's trying to cut now her challenges that she used to be a Green Party activist she used to be much more openly I'm to the left she was an anti war\nActivists in the early days of the Iraq War and that's the kind of thing that her opponent Republican Martha Mac Sally as highlighting to you know try to convince Arizona and that she's not actually a moderate\nI asked about President Trump campaigning earlier what kind of support or the Democratic candidates getting well in\nNevada a Jacky Rosen has gotten support from President Obama who has visited the state to support her a vice president Biden has visited Nevada as well to support Jacky Rosen I mentioned Bernie Sanders or was there I Believe ... Harris the California Democrat\nWho is rumored potential presidential contenders also visiting Nevada so Rosen again by virtue of the way she is campaigning and the kind of platform that she's running on has embraced the leaders of her party\nWhereas semis keeping somewhat more of a distance from you know democratic figures who are or seen as as being on the left because she doesn't want to\nUm she doesn't want to ... herself into that camp\nHere that that is a good question yeah that's that's where a research by Harvard law professor William Urban staying in the ... the court is often a skeptical about both plaintiffs lawyers and class action lawsuit and in this case\nA there is some reason for the court to be\nSkeptical about the intentions of both Google and the lawyers behind the case but when I say there is reason there's at least reason for the court's conservative members\nAre they are the ones who are asking the tough questions about the the settlement today if the settlement gets thrown out it will probably be a decision with a that is at least primarily coming from the conservative wing of the court\nTell us more about what you gleaned from the justices questions that oral arguments\nWell today it's actually quite complicated because there is also an another question that cuts across ideological lines on the court having to do with whether this type of suit\nOr should have gotten into court in the first place a there was an earlier Supreme Court case a couple of years ago a involving the notion of standing that is the idea that you have to be injured before you can bring a case and in federal court\nAnd there are some questions in court today about whether the users who filed this lawsuit over this this\nUm a thing called referral hat or is it the claim is basically that um when you do a search on the Internet on Google and then you click on some website that Google is than sending that information about what your search terms we're to the company's website you call up\nAnd there was some real questions about whether anybody had shown they were harmed by that practice and if there are five justices who are are concerned enough it could be that the court doesn't actually reach the the issues in the case about the settlement itself\nBecause the decision in this case could be just what you said no no decision basically about the fundamental or it could be some you know earth shaking decision about class action\nIt could and you know and what you have to do to to settle the case I'm One of the interesting dynamics here was\nA the two new of justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch um seem to be concerned about very different thing so I don't know ah was didn't seem to be bothered by the standing point was more concerned about the settlement where the money was going to justice course which didn't seem to be concerned about the settlement or at least he didn't ask any questions about it\nBut he was one of the ones who was very concerned about whether this case should have been brought in the first place\nA so he may have a split among the conservative justices about what exactly to do in this case\nWent down to chief justice John Roberts because he was the one that to some years ago he did that did these kind of settlements might be interesting for the court to look at in the right situation\nYeah he he was someone who did express a lot of concern about where the money was going to have a ... he was skeptical of one of the groups getting the money is A. R. P. the senior citizen citizens advocacy group and he was\nA kind of scratching his head as to as to why uh that made any sense\nA allocating the money to that group I did anything to actually a deal with the underlying complaints in this case um he also expressed concern that that some of the money was going to a group that Google had donated to both for 'em so it certainly seems\nGoogle has donated to both for 'em so they certainly seem to be one of the justices who had wanted to take this case in the first place and would like to restrict the sort of settlement\nIn Grand just give us a little bit of background about to Supreme courts attitude in recent years you might say the Roberts Court attitude toward class actions\nAre highly skeptical they have a really skilled them back in a variety of contacts and the one that probably got the most attention was a case involving a Walmart and a discrimination suit against Wal Mart where they essentially said I'm this lawsuit is nationwide lawsuit is to sprawling involved\nEmployees from too many different and too many different situations I'm a little bit different because in this case\nThe company actually likes the ability to settle the shoot show to the extent that you think that this court\nA has a tendency to favor the company than these big class action suit here's a case where\nA Google's actually urging the court to uphold the settlement has managed to get rid of the shoot at a relatively small price tag for Google and uh you know the money actually went to some organizations that Google a doesn't seem to mind are giving money to\nAll right thanks so much ... that's ...

really strong days in a row [noise]\nUm you know one of those you just don't want to read too much you know two days will not even here but I feel like you Dave Wilson about is like okay the ... really nicely performing again it was a course really got beaten path September in October\nFacebook or giving some relief to investors so that helping ... having a very good at day the cushion for music to we just go back to the old ways like after such an ugly wreck for these crowded truck tech trade or people just ... just going to go back to buying Amazon and Netflix from square one out let's\nGo back you know like I can play you know it's usually it doesn't work\nAs well the second time usually when you have such a violent break you think okay well then there's going to be some new play about her new leadership or new themes so to me that is the big question when I see the NASDAQ leading so nicely it does make me wonder whether this is a sustainable move\nBut doesn't it also said clients are because the NASDAQ has been beaten up a lot and I don't know whether you have again you go back to the amount of computers in this market and do you hit certain levels when people say you know what I'm going to buy these levels because what I look at the fundamentals of this company it still makes sense\nI mean you can look at the valuation side of things and yet obviously the market is now cheaper in stock so now cheaper so a lot of people are saying stocks on sale\nBut I've been having very similar thoughts because if you buy the idea that the reason the markets sold off or what played into it was the fact that the fed is clearly raising interest rates you still have trade tensions\nUh stocks and whether the earnings yet the numbers are gone now but we're starting to hear warnings for the future none of that has changed so these are still risks that are out there and what's changed from\nThe other environments have the last how many years have always been you know from ... to the Greek crisis to what have you that they've always been there and yet investors continued to turn higher and I guess this is where Jason we've we've talked an awful lot certainly on the magazine side you know about whether or not yeah so it's a higher rate environment and that ...\nRight and that's just how it's going to be and how much political talk is they're out there I mean both of you are in the enviable position on of sitting on desks where you can't be sigh loaded all your you've got it all coming at\nYou so there's a lot there's a lot like we're in a little bit of a holding pattern right now I'm ... now that we've sort of past\nPeak earnings into everything is now about Tuesdays election but it seems like people are really standing up a dark between trying to really say like what any result would mean for markets on ...\nI mean we heard the common place so yes many people are expecting the house to go to the Democrats you have a gridlock scenario and there's this point that people say commonly that wall gridlock can be good for markets\nBecause that means nothing can get done but I have seen so many different data points and depending on which years are used what the timeframe is some of the data shows that gridlock is better for markets in some of the data shows the opposite so it just goes to show that you can make\nThings can manipulate data no well whatever they think is the case yes I Am shocked to hear shocking shocking but come to the world of journalism to support any story um and hopefully what you do show all the data points out there I Do wonder though\nWith President Xi and President Trump getting ready to meet in November or if the trade rhetoric I think we saw some headlines on that I think that's a big story because we have seen companies talk about ... you know an input cost and having to pass it on our tried to pass it on to consumers but if\nThat trade war escalates I think that could be problematic absolutely I Would say more than ... ... is a consensus\nAt least as people do agree that if some deal is formed in the next couple of months before the end of the air which I had a pretty nice rally other things gets gets worse than a that won't help us that's for sure\nWell I think a lot of emails or on the election has been very McAfee mathematical rather like what's going to result in more stimulus what will result in lower taxes will result in this not so much about figure about real wild cards of what could sort of sin politics and just a total in the\nDirection we're not thinking of ... and ... that's what I was going to say\nWe're going to have a whole discussion about that is coming up this is a deep tease investing in the Trump era mhm uh neck surgeon is going to be with us it is a very uh spoke I say as sort of one of these like fun political reads this is yeah he gets real\nYou're not taking us with a glass of wine you're drinking that's like the first thing in the morning I've had twenty hours during my book now I don't like you know [laughter] [laughter]\nWow so what I Do wonder if the Democrats take the house uh they've already said let's say we're going to go after Trump's tax is ready to go after the relationship with Russia you know whether or not they would do some kind of impeachment proceedings what does that do that you know nothing else gets done but how do the markets had of investors that I don't know how\nIt was like well there's so many ... need to get it done [noise]\nI don't know there are people out of work that would like to have\nBut there's certainly all need to get done\nI don't know there are people out of work that would like to have jobs maybe there's no infrastructure spending there are some things that can be done that would be helpful\nI mean there are certainly things that should be done like that I Would do if I had control of our policy including the river and control the vows twenty but from a market perspective is there are some obvious policy and the thing that needs to happen for the relative continue I don't know I don't know\nIf I was going to continue to do nothing in production saying it's not obvious\nTo me that something needs to be done policy wise to continue either the economic expansion or the market really\nWiden widen tall and contact twenty twenty twenty ... either way flippers for saying that Sarah ... process that reporter\nFor Bloomberg job wise and don't markets editor for Bloomberg and co host of what you miss sending you on your way thank you so much Joe gets from TV or get back to

two hundred million about a hundred and forty five million us from K. K. are raising funds for the first time in three years southeast Asia's largest real estate Porto\n... All right let's get some of the world the national news headline stories at this hour about the leak out ... using any are came up\nWhere people want to hang out anymore as it is that really going to cause a problem for the stock the company earlier this year that that growth is going to massively slow that scared every one quarter comes in and not only does growth not slow as much as people thought it would but the company says\nThat it has huge plans for the future and and so when you break it down so so Facebook says the news feed as you know it it it's not gonna really be the future of the company does this flash of product that Facebook has is going to be eventually be replaced\nBy activity on stories and video now what stories are it's the\nThe thing you may have heard of on Instagram it's where you posted videos from your day and they just disappear after twenty four hours this is what Mark Zuckerberg things is the future of social sharing it's as if femoral content that is is really kind of raw and fun and personal and\nThe problem is is it just has to figure out how to make money off that that's going to take a while um but for now and these are two big categories of the company thinks that they're really going to grow and fast and\n... you'll see a very different kind of Facebook\nAnd what is that really look like from an investor's prospective does it change the way that they view it has it changed the growth church trajectory what did you hear are what are you hearing a from the from both\nThe executive to Facebook on the call yesterday and then investors reaction about how this kind of changed the way they think about it so\nLike I said it's been a year of apology promising to do better and in fixing the problems and you know really investing in hiring people that can solve it from the security perspective and elsewhere\nThis was a call ... came out and said we have a vision we have there's a way we're going to grow that is innovative and new and exciting and you don't\nReally necessarily know what it's going to look like because we haven't done it before\nThat's the kind of Facebook that investors\nYou know they're they're they're looking for they want they want a company that's innovative and growing and had the idea of how it can be bigger in the future instead of just thinking about the Facebook\nProduct as something that's really hit a saturation road growth around the world more than two billion users now right around which they're big kind of existential questions jurors are\nAbsolutely that is a place where all the problems of cropped up because of this viral nature of the website and the way that things are rewarded I mean it's just a mess\nAnd so for them to say like listen that's not even

deductibles are so high they can't even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right my opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi\nAnd she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they can be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp for hopefully not Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes\nOpen borders doubling down on government run health care and of course what they've tried to keep under the rug shot and you know this and are blisters now this impeachment mhm\nNow that an endless investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file a Justice Department and intelligence people but\nThey do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon well listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy races if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now and\nOne week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com the volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you bet\nWelcome a ball the best to you and six days ah it's tough out there nobody can predict what certain say but I Will tell you know I I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me\nAnd I never you never really have a feel for how the house is going to go twenty hand might be an exception where I mean it was a\nMassive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans had been out of power for forty years Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nAnd also if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against their forty five retirements and\nA headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats in the first midterm but then like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving\nOf Clinton because things got better because Newt Gingrich force Clinton into what led to balance budgets and serious reforms in Washington and I think the same thing you know you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty ten\n... especially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats are that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating to me this a brass museum poll out today I had to go back and double check it showing that African American support for the president is now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement\nIf you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey\nTrump's approval rating stays at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range\nAnd I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not\nBefore and and all the media likes to go after asking me as I don't know why he's a great guy in a smart poster but you know they say oh he's a right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that rats museum was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact on the midterm elections but again it's all up to now interesting developments as relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico\nAnd now you have and I look there was only see most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey\nOpen opportunity and the American dream and when you live in poverty and countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally\nVery appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that caravan want a better life\nAnd that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen the president's been very clear\nI'm left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants and from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday\nThe Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage they'd be clear point two percent\nOr you know less source our quarter reporting that she identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away um but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking that people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not going to let them in ... he goes there will be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty or nation built on a on a constitutional\nRepublic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here I'm nearly according\nTo one border official telling the Washington Examiner three

people that were in a caravan they see America as the land of milk and honey and opportunity which we kind of take for granted sometimes as Americans and I'm sure that Ninety nine point eight percent of them are probably good people that just want a better life\nUm we can't vouch for any of those people in terms of other enemies of America that are mixed themselves into that group\nThe idea that we're going to have five seven fourteen thousand whatever the numbers are different estimates room everybody just get to our border and charge across a there is no respect for American law our
