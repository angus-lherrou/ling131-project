advisers in a sense Carol one the former chairman of the Federal Reserve ether six presidents\nIs in a sense Carol one the former chairman of the Federal Reserve you served six presidents that's Paul Volcker he's got a new book out mhm and then there's Tom Barrett\nYes another presidential advisor of course this time to Donald Trump he's been linked for decades they've worked in the real estate market together but it's interesting Tom Barrett without their front and center doing a lot of media on behalf of Donald Trump and candidate Donald Trump they everybody's wondering if you really Trump insider\nPlus welcome to the age of the virtual restaurant that's in our pursuit section but first [noise]\nA tight labor market and companies really can't afford to fire workers in this type of environment so what they're doing that going back to training that they are indeed and whenever there's a story\nLike this we always want to get the Peter coy take and as usual he's got a novel fought here's Peter\nCompanies constantly complain that can't find the people they need that problem's gotten much worse lately because the unemployment rate is only three percent there over seven million unfilled jobs the U.S says of the last count and so what companies do\nAh they can try to poke from other uh employers and they do by the way but that gets expensive you have to raise wages so more and more they're coming out of the idea of ... which just had to read train the people we already have\nAnd of course the idea of training or employees is something that companies have done for centuries really apprenticeships and so on journeyman [noise] but um\nIt kind of fell into a it was on an incline according to bureau of Labor Statistics data for a long time I'm most recent figures in two thousand they showed up fairly stay behind and\nOne reason for that as a companies are afraid that um they put all this money and time and the people and train them up and then they would just be blocked by somebody else\nSo I'm looking at what's happening today the evidence is that there has been an uptick in training\nHuge but it's on a trend how common\nIs it something that has to do just because it's such a tight labor market I\nMean I think it's that\nYou know as unhappy as they are about the possibility of somebody free riding on them and poaching they're people that feel they really just have no alternative but to provide some of their own training\nI mean is extending can lose at work right and the idea and rehiring retraining sales area kittens are via investing train writer existing workforce right and\nAnd even with Obama surveys including Nixon and Reagan he seen so much he's living history\nHe he likes to break things down to the most basic points and he what I liked about working on this book is you might think somebody who's been chairman of the Federal Reserve and under secretary the treasury and then all these big things wouldn't speak and sort of hard to understand our ... he's the opposite he tells it like it is is very plain talking\nAnd I think anybody who picks up the book will learn something\nSo it's incredibly timely as well with that because I mean we're in the midst of a of a time that to call it unprecedented that feels like a cop out it might and white but specifically about the Federal Reserve and the experts in the magazine this week go right to the heart of that\nRelationship that uneasy at times relationship between the Federal Reserve and the White House tell us what he experienced\nYeah so he has seen some pretty extraordinary examples other none as public as what we're seeing today in the current administration so back in the day is that he was serving in the end for instance in the Johnson administration he was in the Treasury Department [noise]\nOne of the stories we excerpted about him attending a meeting between the men treasury secretary Henry Fowler and I'm chairman of the Federal Reserve William chose me Martin who's famous for calling the Fed's job taking away the punch bowl but for the party get started\nAnd President Johnson and what he witnessed in that meeting which was private in the White House of watching President Johnson try to influence the fed to prevent them from raising right so he describes that in pretty vivid detail\nAnd then we also accept a um an example of a of a meeting he went to when he was by then Federal Reserve chairman himself\nIn the eighties and he had been re appointed by Reagan after Carter had originally appointed him\nAnd he'd been ... pointed then I think in Nineteen eighty three and then in um Nineteen eighty four it was an election year and he was in the White House and had a very surprising I think never really describe before experienced\nIs describing because they didn't really fascinating 'cause you do say doesn't happen in the oval office it happens in the library\nJust walk us through it yeah so I mean what he remembers is being asked to come to see the president not in the oval office which he thought was unusual and kind of wondered why he was being some into this library\nAnd when he got there his memory is that he just saw two people Reagan and Baker who was then chief of staff James Baker Jim Baker and uh\nHe remembers Reagan seeming a little bit uncomfortable because Reagan had been a very big supporter of the fed and and very good about not criticizing the fat even though they hadn't quite you know a tough time\nGood about not criticizing the fed even though they hadn't quite you know an tough time with the economy because of the high interest rates he was using to squeeze in place now but now it's an election year\n... brought their and rain doesn't say a word it's only Baker Hispanics and when he recounts in the book is that he saw a Baker basically say the president is ordering you not to raise interest rates\nAnd he didn't know what to say because it and you know he'd seen Johnson who had no trouble twisting\nArms and even he hadn't gotten that far and it's easy to talk about that he Volcker had no plans anyway ratings monetary policy so now he's in a bit about predicting the right kind of ... when it's easy to forget is that it wasn't just\nIn the air you had one of the biggest banks and the country\nCollapsing at that point continental Illinois um and they were all kinds of problems and the money markets and so they've gone from having this very restrictive monetary policy to sort of starting a worry more about keeping the financial system on its feet\nAnd so he was in at that point at all considering raising interest rates so he didn't know what to say in this meeting he just found themselves started thinking\nI better not tell us anybody [laughter]\nAnd it didn't and he didn't he said he told her to his secretary his lungs serving and this woman Catherine my Lardy who is apparently a\nA legend in Washington 'cause she serves many Federal Reserve chairman and currently had this reputation and then people anywhere in Washington go get a phone call in and says here is Catherine then they knew exactly what I said really wield an infant\nAnd she was a vault clearly and she was a ... now\nAnd so what else did you take from this experience in terms of the the relevance to today I mean the Federal Reserve chairman ... in many ways has become a celebrity and in in his or her\nOwn right probably different maybe than in the eighties or or was it\nWell I what I Would say and I think this is pretty clear is that\nThe reputation of the Federal Reserve was sort of on his knee is at the time that Volcker became fed chairman\nBecause uh his two predecessors had not been affected at all inflation was in double digits in this country and one of the things that we are agonized over reading this book is it's so hard for people to remember today I mean we've been so accustomed to low inflation in the country\nThat trying to summon up memory of really crippling inflation that was affecting everything I mean that the government was sort of paralyzed by its inability to deal with anything budgetary or otherwise\nAnd so\nHe was basically called in despite the warnings of the politicians who are worried about what it would do for Carter's reelection chances\nBecause they knew they had a big problem they brought him in he did extraordinary things that nobody had ever done before in terms of how he implemented monetary policy interest rates went up to about twenty percent hard to get her head around hard to imagine right but it works\nIt's an absolute must read a ... thank you for sharing your thoughts\nWith us yeah you and thanks for having now and I'm\nYou think of all of our Business Week coming up how many

degree but um I have plenty of experience and um\nWe recently just had a rap believe and she's with the company for six years but because our bosses have going\nCrazy and um she keeps trying to reinvent the wheel and we're showing her what to do and we had to curtail or software because she's a senior better and then we had to put parameters around it fishy didn't completely screwed up and she acts like he created this thing\nAnd um I think we're going to be bought out by another company Kurdistan and then our departments can emerge with a bigger company but they brought in the other guy to be starting than\nAnd um they're paying it my way more I just found out and I just sat down and I said everybody a new way to use this stock where a lot better because my boss it then like trying to use the software but she created some sort of fresh sheet instead\nOf actually using the software and she told me it'd be better if I Try to figure out how to utilize it so good and I just presented it to her on Monday and she just kept trying to poke holes through it and the assistant manager saw the value in it because she actually understands what we're doing\nAnd then she's going to wait until the new guy comes in even implement the software when he had no idea or had any experience about what we actually do\nAnd um I mean my bosses personal life is crazy like her kid isn't a mental institution right now and her husband I mean it's just not like I'm walking into this and I know what to do because she doesn't really put parameters on things I can push a clock\nIn or out er and I'm just kind of like wondering what's going to happen or hopefully upper management can see what's going on with her\nOr you tempted to tell upper management what's going on with your boss is that a temptation Steve\nOh yeah it's there but I mean like I'm scared though because you know I don't want to seem like I'm like jumping and being in supporting it or anything but it's\nJust like we have to keep training other people in showing other people and she switched our territory so many different times like this again relationships with these people and it's like there's no concept of what we're supposed to be doing\nAnd they're talking about is he doing more here so you're in a sales job right Steve\nWell it's more of like a marketing informative job\nGot it and you have a boss

I've seen one a sequel which was okay and the rest I heard were awful I never saw another one after\nWell I'll tell you the I've seen them all [noise] wow that's a lot of time and you're out all of

Halloween to eat team all star Jamie Lee Curtis and are the ones to watch the others honestly you can\nIgnore everyone was like six of them didn't even have her in\nCorrect wow and they actually still shouldn't say that two of them were Rob zombies remakes\nUh I write ... character and it they didn't have her in her and but they had Laurie Strode in it and they were okay I'm not going to say they were ... they they were probably the\nBull would you say the ones that are ... after the one before I mentioned uh and the ones that are that are I mean washable but they're they're just friday the thirteenth and they've lost their the way the other one you know um but as far as I'm concerned ah it's time to celebrate Halloween\nWith us examining the horror movie with an eye towards recommending a few movies that\nMaybe not seen before or might uh they ... if you've not seen them where they do their research deserve your attention again and don't worry though we're not here to trick you for the very least\nWe are going to aim to provide you with a treat for those who enjoys screaming oh you did the trick or treat thing Carrie clever how do you like that on his his Halloween\nWell that will be horrified me we spoke led the extradition about a movie the last ... stayed with you have to watching The Exorcist which I Believe I saw believe it or not the day after the junior prom with a good bunch of people including a prom dates that was a little odd was either I don't think you were there now that one\nUm it was rather off already been blown up by my prom gate I was on my own I think we're in the fetal position and your bed at the time to one of the many times that nobody was it was I don't know how to describe that now holds up a little bit but back in the day we weren't as gory in the movies as we are now\nRice and when you saw her head spin around where you saw her vomit and so forth where you sort of things are heard that things that she was saying in a different voices it was extraordinarily horrifying and back in the day in the late seventies that was the\nMost horrifying movie of all the time maybe are not living dead which I think this is certainly more horrifying\nIt was it ... it was first of all technically you know the way it was directed in the technology they used was much better than not living dead but the thing is I think it still holds that that spoke factor if you watch it today on a you know relatively nice side screen with the full sound effects or it is still scary yeah how are they always\nSay is that Halloween again establish characters you liked I'm not so sure that you liked cared like so much the little girl and the mom you\nDid like them but I don't know I didn't have to fly out much you know I agree yeah we had that little little smidgen missing of that factor and further didn't have any references to a star trek to uh [laughter] the William Shatner at all why am I saying that I'm trying to work in the fact that I Do know what the mask is that the original mask\nThat friday I mean I was saying that Michael Meyers was using\nNow wearing it was a no world was William Shatner Captain Kirk mask kid out time Syria Syria I'm just remembering it now\nThey they play with the hair and they opened up the pilots and more but it it was not hurt mass from the Nineteen seventies yes wow now learn something new every child is now in the later movies they changed the mass convict uses much all the time the original movie it's the\nUh that's the mask somehow very apropos there you go there's a reference to Star Trek how 'bout this one this goes back a little bit to sixty Nineteen sixty and uh before I tell you what it is and so forth listen to their seats this gives you an idea [noise]\nLike Iran one she\nMad sometimes [noise]\n\nA\nMan to remember that one\nOh sure psycho psycho is pretty good it is it's very scary um and that that\nThat became part\nOf like the vernacular growing up I mean it was it that ... movie predates us but you know when you were you were you are mimicking going after someone holding your arm up in the air with a with a fake an air knife right and and making the stabbing motion you would always go to\nThe music that was playing in the movie became iconic for the shower scene where our Shannon Lee who is a huge\nStar the time was murdered in the shower and now what reference do you have ... chat do we know the reference yeah between Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis\nWas her daughter yeah how 'bout that Jane monsters Janet Leigh is a daughter and\nTwo of them are into the most iconic horror movies of all time that's right pretty pretty interesting it is a that besides that there was also another Hitchcock movie that scared the heck out of me when I saw it as a first as a as a kid on television or the birds\nBirds just go around attacking people without no reason you know what I mean I think we're in real trouble I don't know how they started a wife and I know is here with the quake hit with a lot of all this stuff for the attack on places really back [noise]\nSo what did you think of the birds we saw that one\nGuy was great to I mean I was a kid and and uh the scene where the the explosion that the gas station and just the the er the phone booth when the birds like breaking the glass and the phone booth\nUm and the ... to school house with the kids running and getting attacked by the bird it was I remember it because it was so weird it was so out of left field\nThe that the birds would turn on humans or it was just it just kind of shook you you\nKnow and it was all on believable like birds who care I even have a ... it looked real and then yeah and it became\nTons of birds yes and then they pay you know they they hold themselves up in this house\nAnd it just was so of course how for his guy was so incredibly well directed again two of them hit high cycle and and I think all horror movies should aspire to do with Hitchcock did again he took the time to build these characters up and the ... it's almost like going up that roller coaster you kids start\nAt the stop the top of a rollercoaster and go down right and they've got to go up in ... gives you need to get a clicking and as you're going up the rollercoaster it gives you that anticipation which is almost more\nOf the fear factor than being at the apex and going down right or so and that's what these movies ought to me and that's what Halloween was also a great roller coaster ride\nAnd ah so you know I think those are the epitome also here's one that I Know it was one of the uh it it becomes very\nWell man named Charles ... is the winner Jersey you're\nTelling me the same lines plainly normal individuals [noise]\nOn at some point\nOne must have suffered some kind of\nMental breakdown around um [noise]\nCan rest assured ... and that's not going to happen with\nMe [laughter] this thankfully what'd you remember about ...\nAh the shining was the great also very spooky movie I Know Stephen King wasn't thrilled about the film adaptation of his book same name but ah I remember seeing it in a theater also that there was old enough to see when it first came out and also just just creep me out\nAnd I think he didn't like some of it because what went on in the book was not entirely what went on on the screen and some of what went on the book was in people's minds and all you just they didn't have the exposition to explain really what caused\nAll this yeah it was only or what you were talking about before where the book probably was more into the character development whereas the movie\nYou went there are a little bit but probably not as much as he would have liked to to um it just kind of cut to the chase right like the book started well before the hotel with like the very the back part of the book right there was a whole story about him a ... in the beginning of the book in the movie you just sort of alludes to it really\nThat you know and his pressure in his life is going through and also a is a help explain some of what might took this job and All right side is that what went on\nPreviously and what was the denial of demonic possession if you will of that house\nWhich which they didn't really get into to my in the movie right so uh but again the movie itself I think that a great job you know creep into and there are flashes here and there in the movie of all the stuff that past what went on in the past and the right place but she didn't catch it really fast you need to do the right you know because there was a lot of history to that location here's one that uh\nI don't know a lot of people like I it's it's okay it's\nMore or less a slasher but I think the idea of going to sleep and and being attacked in your sleep is horrifying and\nThe kids live in St Louis something is to get the\nNews [noise]\nHills [laughter]\nJust a little something is\nLet's say you can't kill saw what's this what's with\nThe Boogie Man at the second reference Halloween had one as well to the Boogie Man they should make a horror movie called the Boogie Man I'll probably did maybe I mean like everyone's talking about the what you that's your little kid of course that's yeah\nThe the horrifying being in your sleep were under the bed right I Want to bring the closet yep yeah man's in the closet and by the way if you watch the uh well there was a closet scene in Halloween the new one I'm not giving away does ... Halloween\nAs a closet scene there as well I don't want to hug it's going to be part of the roller coaster ride and then you have one you mentioned the a different movie would\nWell we were talking about movies I personally have crack me out spook me a big one was the Blair Witch project the original one back in a row nine Ninety nine or so\n[noise] [noise] like national sorry it is nice because it was my project [noise]\n\nThat one lasted a you know with me I I saw the end of it in like a couple of hours later I remember it finally hitting me what happened at the end of that movie yeah yeah and it lasted for why would the kids are up against the wall and behaving for this entity that is going to kill them one the next next but they're just waiting to be slaughtered\nYeah and the I think the brilliance of this movie was that you never you never saw the which right it was all about the kids and the reaction and the fear and and the clues are being left and\nAnd back then you know the handheld camera the whole movie thing was very new to the world so from the filmmaking perspective it was it was very creative and yeah I see how that stayed with me for a while\nThe body of Jason and somehow he ended up on his space craft ... going somewhere well that can happen course and\nThey saw him out and the hilarity ensues on the ship they throw him out on the ship yeah he's met someone that he was accompanied they send them on a spaceship without people with a crew yes and on his house\nJust to make just to basically create the premise of the movie that's why they did it\nAnd the astronauts two of them were young ladies and they wear in outer space half shirts where they show belly shirts you can see the picture so I mean it it's so it's so bad like just it looks like the ...\n... it says it's from two thousand one but these women look like they're wearing outfits from like a sick the sixties go go movie\nYeah they they clearly were made just ... ... the mood let's be able to use different outfits have attractive\nWomen or be hunted by Jason I mean wow really really bad is yeah I don't have any others or not I have one that's a really good one that I that was raided bad I think you should say oh that's interesting that's a that's Denzel Washington John Goodman in a movie from Nineteen Ninety eight called\nThe fall and where there's a demonic\nPresidents ... inside of Syria serial killer serial killer just before he dies at the electric chair touches a prison guard and his essence goes to prison guard and any time and and then he kills an anytime that someone has touched by this person has ... corporate with the essence of this\nDemon uh it becomes the demon takes over your body and Denzel Washington John Goodman are ah cops trying to solve these murders a string of murders and he finds out this and it's it's a great idea I thought it was done really really really well I mean I just the fact that\nBoth of them John Goodman and Denzel would agree to be in this movie to me says it's probably pretty good movie\nYeah I Would definitely check it out if you say it's been on lists of of the worst horror movies of all now is I Know it's just a a rotten tomatoes give it like forty two so I don't I don't know why I thought it was really done a lot to check that one of those one sometimes I don't know if people are the reviews are right about ... check it out in the fall and every other less than thirty seconds here or there\nWas a I remember there's a really bad a remake of Halloween speaking of Halloween Halloween three seasonal which I'm which you know right off the bat there is no which in it [laughter] I don't I never really got it you're waiting ... during the movie okay where's the which\nNow there is not what China's gray and has no uh of Michael Meyers and there's no Jamie Lee Curtis\nExactly to use the company that makes ...

U. dot org on Facebook we have all over three million fans on Facebook\nAnd Twitter to we have six hundred and fifty thousand people on Twitter and on my website and you can see the for New York times bestseller that I've written the last one is called the future of humanity talking about humanity in outer space\nAs he goes back to the moon than Mars perhaps then and then maybe even the stars\nAnd speaking about outer space once again our special guest this hour is Steven for training\nYou're a science for life magazine\n[noise] he was also an editor of discover magazine and Washington Post magazine and he also worked for time magazine as well\nAnd he's the author the book how we live on Mars which was made into a TV series by Nat geo and channel so Steven glad you could be on science fantastic\nIt's a pleasure to be here Michio\nCapers question for you is how did you get interested in Mars and why did you write the book how we'll live on Mars\nWell originally it was a a project that was conceived by Chris Anderson who's the curator and owner of the Ted conferences and I'm ...\nHad been a speaker at had a couple of times and I had been speaker of the main stage a couple of times and we both shared I'm a natural interest than Mars and and um I had come up with questions for\nThe law and money was on the stage the Chris could ask him [noise] and ah Chris wanted to start a hardback book division for the ... conferences and he made a deal with Simon and Schuster\nTo publish about ten bucks a year and the idea was that they would be something you could read in one afternoon I'm would go into much more in depth than a typical ... talk and I asked me to do have to talk on Mars and the possibility of going to Mars\nIs a little bit different from the usual science showed the mixes professional actors I asked are not going to Mars we're talking heads myself included who appear on the Nat geo program\nSo before we continue as heat and let me ask you a personal question you've been a senior editor at the lights in the Washington Post in time what got you into science science writing what got you into that\nI was there for a kid from a from a very early age I was a bill to dark room when I was six years old and I was developing my own film um I tried to build I became fascinated with rocketry as a child and\nUm for a number of years I Try I built a lot of model rockets using kind of the normal F. this kind of erotic rock and stuff and then I decided that I wanted to build a serious rocket and I wanted it to be solid fuel\nAnd um I decided on at composition from the fuel the craft carols um which I melted in a pot which are provided sugar which provide enough oxygen as they are ...\nAnd I use the same nitrate or as most of most of the people but\nI ... I was never able to get the formula right I I all I blew off all the hair on\nMy head once and and my wife and more than one and blew up\nA one on the on the stove concocting it but I kept making people and I could never quite get it right and then I had a friend or a an adult friends who knew Werner von Braun and um I got him to\nAsk corner von Braun what I was doing wrong and the answer that they came back was that I was mixing chemicals by volume instead of by weight and when I mix them by weight I Do well the most amazing solid\nEngine or a hands and sent a number of rockets having having those knows where I'm going to because I never found them\nThey're not very high demand that in our staff and uh and that people will actually\nWork but I Do I developed a very serious interest in rocketry and science as a kid and um you know bill flying model airplanes and stuff like that and then when I was fourteen began because I wanted to be up there\nOn the rocket a or in the airplanes I started taking Grider less as you can actually get a gliders license\nAt fourteen I'm One of them was successful in getting that but when I was sixteen I got a powered a private pilot's license and has been a pilot ever since so it it it's in it's in the air I'm interested in\nAmazing and then how did you get interested in becoming an editor and editor in life magazine at the Washington Post is titled entirely\nBy accident um I I started out when I was an undergraduate I started out as a math major and finally hit a wall\nIn math that made me feel like that wasn't going to be a lot of fun and transferred to be a chemistry major um and then I was six major um and I just kept piling up all the credits at all these years as an undergraduate and kind of spinning my wheels and going nowhere and\nUh I had a friend on my on the college daily uh newspaper on campus um that I was a woman that I was dating and she got me\nIf we're on campus um that I was a woman that I was dating and she got me working on the paper and then\nI ended up actually becoming the editor in chief of the daily newspaper on my campus and um went off to graduate school in communications so that's how I got dragged into journalism quite accidentally\nOkay well you have the best of both worlds on one hand you have the hard science and on the other hand you have the ability to spring that hard science to the general public\nWell let's get right back to your book how we'll live on Mars\nFirst of all there have been other shows about Mars and some of that makes you cringe when you watch them losing her mistakes they made however it did was the movie the Martians starring Matt Damon and you see that movie and what are your thoughts about some of the perils that face when he tried to live on Mars\nOf course I've seen the movie um I Know Andy where the author of the Martian quite well and uh we frequently end up on the same panel someplace um and when the Martian first came out and he was\nVery defensive about some of the scientific accuracy of the movie for example you know you have the opening scene where Matt Damon get punctured by a a radio math that his flying through the air and I'm\nAndy has finally come around to a point where he does not try to defend some of these things anymore um if if the Martian winds were blowing up three hundred miles an hour\nBecause the density of the atmosphere of Mars is only one law now hundreds of earth\nIt would be more like a three mile an hour winds are blowing against him and I wouldn't be pushing around any any radio mess certainly enough punk sharing space with them so you know there are a lot of things are quite a few things in the Martian that don't hold up scientifically but\nI Will say this um\nI Can't even talk in twenty Fifteen on going to Mars and a lot of that was based on conversations I had with the London mosque um who in the early stages participated quite a bit of my book and then kind of a ritually ... and I were going to do the book together or from the ... conference\n'em and Iran and had to drop out because he was just too busy with for the space that\nUm but I speak with him and I and I was a really inspired by his plans to get humans to Mars and really convinced that that that would happen and um and that\nAnd and so when I'm when I gave us at talk in twenty Fifteen\nThere were a number of people in the audience who just simply didn't believe that they thought really humans on Mars within a decade it's just not going to happen as soon as possible for the wild and crazy dream and and then my book came out about two months after that and the book is\nA very journalistic you know I'm not making anything up in fact it was\nIn fact checked by a fact checker who works for the New Yorker so and to this day no one has that were found a fact in that folks that is wrong\nI'm have bought the book you know also seemed to a lot of people more like science fiction science fact they just couldn't believe that we haven't had the technology has to do this for at least forty years\nUm and then the Martian came out a couple of months after my book came out and all of a sudden\nCopies of my book started selling like crazy um the whole thing with National Geographic took off um and they became very interested in making the documentary series and I think it was all the cause that movie came out so\nThe movie has a lot of inaccuracies in it um Hollywood has the ability to change the culture in a in a stream Lee powerful way and I didn't really even surprised me because all of a skepticism that I hadn't seen about go\nA private enterprise and space from people like space sacks who at that point have not ever landed a freelance editor rocket successfully that have been launched\nThat have was still a very young company um and and a fledgling rocket company for them to imagine that their sole mission most to get people to Mars and build a sustainable colony seemed absolutely fantastical\nTo most people and yet when the Martian came out despite its inaccuracies and despite its fantasy I mean there's\nPre high level of fan of the the main ship that they use 'em to go from earth to Mars with this giant rotating wheel that\nCreates artificial gravity even though that's an old idea\nUm the the concept of building the spacecraft that large which would have to be built in orbit still a little fantastical\nUm and and despite all the fantasy in the Martian convince the general public but this was somehow real that this concept of going to Mars was not a fantastical is they have\nClaws before so I found very grateful to the Martian for getting you know we can and other commercial break but after the break we're going to continue the discussion of your book how we'll live on Mars\nWhich is now and that she owes series entering his second season so watch for it on television you are listening to science fantastic give us a call and six one to\nFive

L. S. launched says some\nTended to Mars in their late twenties thirties and\nSend to Mars in their late twenties thirties\nAnd do kind of a power weight mission theloop around Mars and come back to earth rock I can almost guarantee you that space and then the rocket will land on Mars long before now goes and simply makes in orbit around Mars and come back\nThe truth of the matter is that we no longer need government\nTo get into space the cost of space launch is coming down so quickly it's really study the typical atlas five lawns you would have to pay two hundred and fifty million dollars to launch a telecommunications satellite Entergy of synchronous orbit\nFrom United launch alliance which is a kind of a consortium between Boeing and Lockheed operates the atlas system two hundred and fifty million bucks\nSex comes along with the falcon on the same satellites and says the same orbit for sixty million dollars completely disruptive\nOf the whole space launch system anywhere including the area and five or any of the Russian rockets far less than anybody else ever show now they can recover the first stage booster and have recovered several first age because\nThere's no ... well let's take another short commercial break a once again you're listening to science fantastic with ...

that the air force was covering up the fact that alien bodies were recovered from flying saucer to crash [noise] well I still remember the air force officials said wait a minute\nIt was a weather balloon that's all it was a weather balloon and then the critics said now wait a minute why would the Airforce cover it up\nIf it was just a weather balloon\nAnd then the efforts official kind of like him didn't hard 'cause it's just a weather balloon project mogul that crashed why the cover of why this elaborate PR effect well it turns out that the military over the years\nWhy this elaborate PR effect well it turns out that the military over the years would actually deliberately tantalizing only talk about flying saucers in order to deflect criticism of the stealth bomber\nThe self bumbling being protected in areas like area fifty one and the military and wanted to keep top secret some of our experiments on their cells bombers so they deliberately floated flying saucers stories but something then came out a few years after that\nA few years after that in Albuquerque the press here noted the fact that the military conducted top secret experiments\nAnd one of them is the future of the mind where I Do talk about\nBrain scans use using brain scans as a lie detector tests and the question is how accurate are they anyway\nWell it turns out that when you look at brain scans of the human brain when you tell a lie it registers the usual thing the brain of course controls sweating activity and voluntarily sweating activity pulse rate you can pick that up on a brain scan\nBut lying and telling the truth or telling a lie we have not found the center in the brain that does that\nMaybe there is no center of the brain that does that we don't know but at the present time we have not located at that point of the brain\nWhere if you tell a lie it begins to light up\nSo when people say that with Ninety nine percent accuracy brain scans can detect liars ah well that's kind of stretching it\nBrain scans could take a lot of things which you can also detect use the ordinary polygraphs but brain scans are still primitive were in the beginning stages maybe eventually we'll find dead center of the brain that regulates truth and untruth but right now we have not yet founded\nSo don't believe that when people say that was Ninety nine percent accuracy we can use MRI's scans as lie detectors that's not to say that it won't be possible in the future but at the prison time brain scans are still in is in their infancy\n[laughter] okay well let's move on to the next listener phone call\nAnd my question by\nHer [noise]\nIt was Isaac Newton himself who figured out that the larger the planet\nThe more the gravity in fact he found the precise relationship between gravity and mass the forests between two objects is proportional to the masses are these objects\nDivided by the distance squared times that constant due to the University of gravitational constant using that equation bingo he was able to calculate the motion of comments like ... comment that was a tremendous victory for science\nBecause people didn't know what A Guided the plan is an especially they didn't know where comments came from but using ... you could actually ... the future trajectory of Haley's comment\nAnd then Haley was able to predict when he and his comment would return back to the light at the skies over London\nBut you ask a deeper question why why is it that gravity is related to mass well now we have yet another theory Einstein's theory that takes it one step farther and that is that mass warps space around it\nThe bigger the mass the more the ... the more the ... the more the distortion of an object moving in the gravitational field\nSo objects move in a curve line going around the sun like the earth because the sun has warped space around the earth and that's why the earth goes around the sun in fact that's what you're seeing her share right now\nHow come you're not floating how can you not being hurled at thousand miles per hour into outer space 'cause that's the velocity that you are traveling at right now you are traveling at a thousand miles per hour\nThe earth's circumference is twenty four thousand miles\nAnd they are twenty four hours in a day so bingo you divide and you get the fact that you're moving at a thousand miles per hour so why because not because gravity is pulling you down desperate Newton would say the biggest space is pushing you down\nSo to summarize Einstein's theory of relativity in one sentence it is that gravity does not poll space\nPushes and then you may ask you another question why is that why is that why is it that the larger the mass the greater the ... and the greater the gravitational attraction\nWell the answer to that is we do know sorry about that that is a postulate given to us by Newton and now by Einstein where does that come from we think that eventually comes from string theory but then you may ask another embarrassing question where does string theory come from\nWhere I'm at that point I plead guilty I don't know and for that matter and\nWell at that point I plead guilty I don't know and for that matter and neither does any physicist on the planet earth\n[laughter] okay well let's move on now to take the next listener phone call\nThis the the the forty year Kaye loose than Montana\nMy question to you is or\nWhat is your in your own wormholes you think that that's something that someday we can exploit and actually use\nPlease anything\nWhat if you want to see a wormhole in graphic detail or look at Star Trek Star Trek deep space nine whenever it started sharing the space nine begin it opens up with a wormhole\nThat looks very much like a world pool or a funnel unfortunately that's not what a world that's not what a wormhole looks like sorry about that but in Star Trek these days nine wormholes are gateways to another point of the galaxy we should occur naturally\nSo they're not artificial they're created naturally they're found and when you find them they can become very cheap gateway to the other sector of the galaxy well one to just science say about these things\nWell wormholes were first introduced by Albert Einstein himself yes he was Nineteen thirty five that Einstein wrote a famous paper which students\nA nascent Rosen called the Weinstein Rosen bridge paper\nHe took to black holes which sort of resembled a funnel stuck them back to back\nTake two finals\nThem thinking back to back and if you fall into one final you fall out of the other federal\nThat is a worm hall is a gateway it's a short cut to a new space and time now Einstein himself did not think that we could create a worm hall of course he was playing with black holes so it would take the energy of a black hole\nBut he didn't believe that this is very interesting because they were solutions of Einstein's equations so think of Alice is looking glass the looking glass and ours is the wormhole Alice sits in the\n... in Oxford, England on the other side isn't mad had her in wonderland and by going through the glass you instantly are transported to another point in the universe\nWell you can also you this is a time machine as well in fact my my colleague Stephen Hawking who recently passed away posts human has published a book and in the book he says well he's backtracking a bit he believes that time travel\nTime travel two wormholes may be possible he used to say it was not possible but he has since backtracked\nAnd his latest book written posts to slay says that perhaps wormholes can also be used as time machines now what's the catch is always a catch some place otherwise somebody would have built one of these damn thing ... years ago right\nThey catch it as well as Einstein himself realize to create a worm hauled you need fabulous amounts of positive energy like a black hole and then negative energy destabilize the to keep it open\nSo it was Einstein himself realize that positive energy in the form of a black hole might rip the fabric of space and time for Stephen Hawking had a mathematical proof\nShowing the if you have enough negative energy you can stabilize and keep it stable so you can walk back and forth and not be crushed or the wormhole wouldn't collapse on you like as as it does sometimes on Star Trek that you can keep the gateway open\nSo the catch is of course we do not have the ability to manipulate the energy of a black hole and we can only create microscopic miniscule quantities of negative energy in the laboratory\nAnd so far far away from being able to use the power of a wormhole but are they possible yes\nDo we know for sure well no because ultimately we have to rely on a higher theory to stabilize the black hole and that theory is string theory that's what I Do for a living that's my day job unfortunately string theory is not yet an advanced enough\nTo answer all these questions it gives us tantalizing clues that these questions are asked rubble but the mathematics is horrendous I Know 'cause they work on it\nThe mathematics is horrendous at the present time no one can conclusively say that more moles they exist and are stable now some businesses have published articles saying that maybe they can be found naturally like Star Trek the big bang inflated a tiny piece of the universe\nCan maybe there was a warm all there in which case a Warhol would have been inflated to giving us a naturally occurring ... just like in deep space nice\nWell let's take another short

physics is so bizarre\nWhy is that Clinton Syria one of the weirdest theories ever propose and yet we need the quantum theory without the quantum theory well there's no radio no television there's no electronics modern technology and the transistor laser is\nAll of it depends upon the Clintons theory and it boils down to a simple question is light a particle or a wave Newton Todd light was a particle\nOther people showed that light has weighed like properties it as a wavelength\nIt has a frequency and is very similar to other forms of electromagnetic radiation and the next big step was taken in the Eighteen sixties by James Kirk Maxwell\nHe showed that if I take an electric fields and vibrating it creates a magnetic field and if I take a magnet and shake a magnet he creates an electric field so then he asked the question\nIf I if I meet a lecture field to create a magnetic field which creates an electric field to create a magnetic field\nThen does it propagate does it move all by itself well he showed that it does a wave away like ripples on upon forms of magnetism and electricity and then he calculated to speed up that way than he was shocked\nAbsolutely shocked this is one of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of homo sapiens\nHe found that vibrating electric and magnetic fields that you can create in your own living room\nThe vibrations travel at the speed of light and then he either the most important where all the time you said maybe this is\nAnd he was right light isn't electro magnetic wave\nWhen it vibrates even faster it turns into ultra violet radiation when device by by slower it turns into infrared\nAnd faculty vibrate it that different frequencies enters into television and radio ultraviolet gamma rays all the colors all the radiation said do you hear about it can be summarized by vibrating electric and magnetic fields the next breakthrough came with a quantum theory\nAnd he was Einstein himself who said that light is based on photons particles\nSo now we had a conflict we had a war raging in physics where new and then I Stein said that ... was a particle everyone else you know it's a way we can vary practice reflected it has a wavelengths a we know everything about waves so who's right well actually both are right\nIt was a max born this ... this is to finally put these two things together in a way that Einstein hated sorry about that but Albert was wrong on this one\nIt turns out that light is a particle\nIs made out of photons photons are particles of light so to answer your question is I had a particle or wave well it's a particle but the probability of finding the particle that at any given point is given by a wave\nSo if the wave is strong at a certain point is likely to be there\nWell Einstein hated that idea why light ... ... ... chance come on give me a break the march of science that Einstein was to reduce uncertainty to eliminate all the likelihood of visiting the likelihood of that\nTo get this tentative answers\nSo Einstein thought that the universe is considered a tiny little steel balls these it'll still balls you knew exactly where they were doing their velocity that position no ifs ands or buts that's\nA common sense point of view by the way you consciously or unconsciously saying that everything is made out of definite little objects you know exactly where they are when they are and the story\nWell sorry about that that's not true\nThe quantum theory says that light has within a wave\nAnd wave tells you where it is most likely to be found so if the wave maximum in a certain area than chances are that's where it is that's called the uncertainty principle that you don't really know where anything is at any given point meaning that electron you don't really know where it is\nIt could be two places at the same time now at this point you may say to yourself\nWhoa stop\nThere two places at the same time\nStop right there two places at the same time well yes two places at the same time and and what is it practical applications of this\nTransistors lasers dire does computers [laughter] I've ... the Internet all of them based upon this bizarre idea that electrons couldn't be two places at the same time the probability of funny that damn electron is given by a wave\nThis is amazing when I look at myself on a mirror\nI realized first of all I'm

night celebrating ten years of somber weekend it was about a hate and it was about a synagogue\nIn Pittsburgh and a man named Robert powers at forty six destroying his life and more importantly he uh destroyed the lives of eleven and people and others to eleven people dead six less seriously injured including a couple of police officers what happened is before ten o'clock he\nWent into the tree of life synagogue in a suburb of Pittsburgh\nAnd he opened fire he was screaming anti medics thing that I Can't sit by and watched by people get slaughtered and screw your optics them going in and all these other kinds of horrible thing so because of the anti Semitic rants on social media\nNow the FBI is investigating the attack as a hate crime doesn't bring back the victims who range in age from their fifties your brothers\nTo uh up to their Ninety that people were stunned people who lives in the neighborhood where some people who go to the Pentagon worst honestly heard these words before it was a rampage here's alone guy by himself\nHe was trying to leave the synagogue after when he did and then they are Gotham they forced him out he was injured but he's fine and it is of\nThe Pittsburgh

for that matter killing any innocent people but let's stick with that first that is just despicable beyond belief\nJust ... reprehensible I mean I can use all kinds of wars and doesn't bring the victims back it doesn't quite well the the hate I think moving forward as the question of what do you do I talked about this and another hour and a show\nI had a conversation with one of my buddies in Los Angeles to think of Los Angeles and we talk about gun debate and all that and which is not the place for that but he said that in his church they have people that have concealed carry 'em and that they agreed the during every service\nSomebody two to three people would be there who are certified\nUm practice with their weapon they ... and they would be in a church in case the worst happened or in case the worse happened that we even have to think that\nWay but moving forward there may be more people that think that way where they either get security or they have to lock the doors a which is an equally as that and you know here's the bottom line\nOf people in Pittsburgh we wrap our arms around June there's vigils being held for them and there's money being raised there's comfort that's being served up because that's the kind of people we are but it doesn't bring back the victims I don't know about you but I think of my grandmother who wasn't church\nOn an outrageous sub rage rage thing to happen and the people in Pittsburgh are reacting um\nYou know hatred can't we can still be a deal that were the find that you fall out of the Pittsburgh game the Pittsburgh\nSteelers winning their game but the focus so much of the focus on thinking of the poor people the victim that that ... that were were slaughtered and\nOf course people are coming together\nTo rally around those folks are the kind of world we live and that's the kind of people we are in the United states and I hope that that's not forgotten and all of this on the global insanity and hateful sick twist and a man's

so so many and we had three hate filled kind of crimes three hate filled suspect that have\nCaused havoc to other people there was the grocery store I haven't even mentioned that and I'm One of my favorite Dave Kentucky Jefferson town Kentucky just outside of Louisville and it you\nKnow it's um\nThink about it there was a guy who'd banged on indoor First Baptist church\nAnd tried to pull it up and couldn't pull it up and couldn't get inside\nSo then he went to a Kroger store he shot to people both African American the first was sixty nine sixty nine year old Maurice Ballard who was with a twelve year old grand on the ground from their uncle he's buying a poster board I don't think about this for a school project really\nThe second or a sixty seven year old woman who was killed in the parking lot\nAnd the guy what uh the mayor there that I'm picking heartbroken an angry I Would feel that way about any act of violence and called me and this guy had a history of mental illness made racist grab repeatedly called his ex wife at the end we're all kinds of\nUm things are coming out about that because of course you look into the history and want to know what could possibly what could possibly make that happen and what would drive somebody can do that to Gregory Bush fifty one years old I'm fifty one year old white\nMen would try and do that what what does it what what what pushes in that direction\nAnd then we had the whole bombing thing and the fifty six year old Florida Man these days are so I act and he mailed fourteen and I thought it was Thirteen now they're saying fourteen a pipe bombs they didn't detonate but they were real and\nUm his hatred obviously was there and then the woman out the gunmen who went into the synagogue\nIs a really really rough\nWeek a couple of days really for that kind of stuff that stuff that we don't want it to happen here in the United states disagreements not caring for the way\nI'm from the rhetoric goes all that fine but to have this happen you know I mean terrible absolutely\nHuh indescribable bats it described will\nMove on to something else to talk about something else it's like we mean Halloween is coming up in a few days about Halloween is going to turn us around but we need something to bounce back on right what what are the positive\nStories out there that are happening in the positive is what so many of you are doing reaching out in helping other people and\nUm then we see that everyday examples of that and pulling people out the neighborhoods and and I choose to believe\nReally I Do that we really are a nation of people that are givers and care about other people and stronger and stronger than hate is something we are stronger is enough to feel that he is stronger than that were stronger than that you know\nAbsolute absolutely I mean absolutely I'm gonna I'm gonna go in that direction with ah with everybody else I like looking at a couple of other things\n[noise] um [noise] you know I talked about the Powerball thing and somebody asked\nMe all these if you want in power of all we should still do the show absolutely ten years on this show you think you're getting ready to me that easy of course no of course I'll hang around when the Powerball I'm not usually a lottery player but um I did I did play the lottery\nAnd just a little a little amount nothing big I see people that are

beyond that I've gotten so many email this past week our mail bag over blowed and we'll get to that and and the anti Semitism there is just no place for it I don't get it to attack in Pittsburgh that and I\nKnow explanation for it to go in in a God the Pittsburgh shooter and got back and say I just want to ... what is wrong Robert ... hours forty six years older than charged with twenty nine ... eleven people killed and that happened on\nSaturday you know there's all these court document that people are talking about and what the court documents provided\nA glimpse of the south back then you know twenty minutes to black head is what it is that the tree of life congregation synagogue and squirrels hill and that neighborhood and I even the mayor a bill or\nWell hill and that neighborhood and ah even the mayor of build a ... at a news conference promises that he would be stronger from a very very dark day and what can you say we've been knocked down before we get up we stand back we worked together and people are really reaching out thank goodness and we ... we know where that kind of country but\nThis this is what happened so he goes in he's shouting anti Semitic nonsense he\nOpened fire on the people that are there he's got a an A R Fifteen semi automatic rifle three glock handguns and three of the weapons were were purchased legally because that's what happens in the conversation turns to that\nBut at least ... you know nobody had anything there to defend themselves and I've had this conversation with a few people where can field and carry in some churches so it can happen in any church any house of\nWorship the true they got people planted bed have concealed carry weapon to protect the people now that is going to be more I think of the conversation 'cause 'cause the answer is what do we do what do we do moving forward this is one night job who destroyed these innocent lives to forty six year old guy\nBut the answer is how do you protect yourself from that\nAnd there's all these stories about hearing noises and people running and seeing dead people and I mean awful people from their fifties all the way up to their nineties and I'm like I said defect has been charged with no twenty nine cats make that clear in synagogue\nShooting in Pittsburgh to criminal complaint is saying what I just said that he said a lot of anti Semitic stuff I Want to kill Jews that kind of thing they're committing genocide my people he kept repeating that when it becomes but hate crimes kind of thing obviously\nThe Anti Defamation league what are they going to do they call for the attack one of the deadliest and it is on the Jewish community and now in Korea cure any police presence that's going to go across the nation and it was warm but it's not just that remember there have been shootings in churches certainly and\nPeople killed can we know and I could if all the time we live in the greatest country on the face of the earth and seeing people that are going to worship whatever their religion is and not coming out alive is just to pick a bowl and unacceptable so\nThings happening that bomb attacks in ... um the eleven people killed in the Pittsburgh Pentagon [noise]\nYou know certainly it shouldn't be a political certainly what happens to be political I Would agree with that any Democrat or Republican and says that I completely agree things divers for Republican from Ohio the head of the national Republican convention committed in\nCommittee rather than the Democrats are merely political opponents that enemy is very good very wise and set it on Fox that we need to come together\nTo it and the best interest of America no matter who wins in ten days we can come together and make that happen in bravo yeah yeah yeah yeah and of course the president or and and members of both parties are condemning the explosive devices address to\nFormer President Obama Clinton congresswoman Maxine Waters and others and the murder of eleven people shockingly and the tree of life synagogue and it's and Pittsburgh on Saturday which by the way it was the deadliest attack on Jewish on a Jewish community\nAnd us her story um\nBut yeah we have election day on November ... let's say of early voting and you can be in the race and\nJust talk about what you want to see happen to agree with that has to be doesn't have to be marred by craving now that you know come on right the finger pointing all that kinda stuff forget all that nonsense about when it\nIs about it's about your person running it's about what you think needs to happen in your area your representative winnings to James life for\nThe senator from Oklahoma that\nSunday and he's a Republican that while the president's rhetoric can be problematic it's not to blame for the violent actions of the two people in the past week and I agree a Senator Bernie Sanders\nWasn't to blame or one of his supporters opened fire on a group of Republican lawmakers remember the softball practice last year it was horrible and can be pointing fingers in that direction because they can go both ways on that as\nAwful awful awful um that the political discourse the level and at\nThat I think is the problem we get I mean I look I've been doing America Tonight for ten years on this frustrated as you things have affected my family deeply\nStatic stupid decision on the hill that infuriated me I've gone to Washington area I'm In it I get it because I always say I'm about vote vote vote if you want to have if you want to have a say\nIn anything but certainly not at this horrible nasty level where you know you can have a day but you have to take out the person has legs no that's not how I was raised I Know a lot of you are good people even\nPerson's legs no that's not how I was raised I Know a lot of you are good people you weren't raised that way\nDefinitely when have the rhetoric of in a in a different direction is what I say hey by the way hats off to the people who are donating to the synagogue victims they raised more than three hundred thousand and one day there's been vigils all over the place to how to\nRepair broken heart in when this happened um and [noise] you know again trying to help families\nBeing same violence all of that whatever it takes by the way the suspect has been charged and all and supplies of again\nWith twenty nine count damning from the attack\nIncluding violating hate crime laws um so you know there you go with that [noise] in the meantime while that's happening you know wild thoughts are there and so much is this lunar looser pick nonsense um\nIs going on there there are other things believe it or not hard to switch gears though right I mean the Pittsburgh Penguins aren't even going to have a blood drawn to collect\nA collection to help the synagogue victims and there's you know all kinds of people doing all kinds of things and how do you pivot on this but there are a couple of other things that are\nHappening obviously the elections big vote you want to make a difference going vote get involve locally that's where it starts know who you're voting for when I was a kid that was and this probably stems to me doing this show current events knowing what's happening all that stuff\nVital and in my life because my mother told me don't come to the kitchen table if you don't if you're not versed on what's going on and I applaud her for that so she knew that she wanted to raise two people that were going to be involved in what was happening in this great country you know growing up a stone's throw away from\nWhere the founding fathers met with a declaration of independence outside of Philadelphia anyway so I always think of the the right to vote as a really sacred won ... always in my life\nThat will be important and I hope it is important in your life too that when you want to complain you can lay claim right um\nAnd that's what I that's what I think I mean honestly so we've got um\nJust a couple of weeks and then the fish all and then boom you know voting that's it\nThe Democratic campaigns and outside fundraising groups are expected to outspend the Republican in the final stretch for the midterms that I was looking at some\nUm numbers heading into the weekend actually not Democrats are expected to spend a hundred and forty three million on TV ads in the house races compared to the six for the Republicans\nAnd there's a big surge on an ad by then you know so what's going to happen there the Republican National committee has held a fundraising has a fundraising\nAdvantage over the Democratic National Committee committee rather during the cycle\nThe Democratic congressional candidates combined raised more than one billion that crazy this election cycle through September compared to the seven hundred and nine million for Republicans\nAnd there's all kinds of numbers surrounding that but here's the bottom line Democrats are looking to get the majority in the house and Senate in the midterms\nThey have to gain twenty three seats to retake the majority in the house back again to see in the Senate to do the same thing in the upper chamber I think a lot of these races are close to close to call and they're going to come down to the wire and that's why again\nVoting is so important for what you think should happen\nLook at who's running where and what's happening in your world because it could be closer than you think and you could have an income that you think is naturally going to win\nBut maybe it's not you know maybe it's not as obvious as you think that they're going to win it it might be much much tighter let's put it that way\nI was talking about money for a second so many of you asked me about\nWhat I think about the stock market I think if you're talking about investing in anything any kind of investment you have if you can't I don't care if you have a few dollars whatever it is I'm\nBeing serious about the diversify right diversify I've heard people say oh you can't make money on bitcoin but I Know people that made a lot of money on bitcoin because they believed and they got in in the beginning when it was right to get in\nSo it paid off visiting for them we have definitely seen down markets and part of that is on earnings people taking back money that's what happened I think it's all said again is that it last week it's been called a market correction and that's what happened\nI mean when it be great if we could all put money in the stock market and walk away with a ton of money yeah or you have the four oh one K. and then you work for a company luckily maybe some of you where you get that money and you put it in and it gets\nMatched and then you've got to pick the basket of you know dark and you pick who you hope you pick on why ugly but you know it kinda bunker correction are armed guard in territory so we call\nHeading into the weekend the the market was was down again the NASDAQ the tech having our that closed down over two points with chairs and Amazon losing over seven percent of Google soccer down to point two percent and\nYou know has it run its course the Dow Jones ended two hundred Ninety six point one point\nAnd Nineteen percent and almost eight percent from down on the eight percent from its high on October third the answer is you pay attention to watch for happening and you know you get all these gain and it actually is going to come back it's going to there's going to be a correction some of it is higher interest rate\nBut um you watch and you pay attention to what's whiskey and you pay attention\nStay with us as I said you're talk coming up we'll try\n[noise] one of\n\nThe Boston Red Sox are the twenty Eighteen World Series champions I'm an

games\nThe shooter and the daily Pittsburgh synagogue attack is scheduled to face a judge Monday but the investigation continues into the incident that led to eleven deaths\nYeah um people in Pittsburgh all over the place we're holding vigils there's for for the people killed in that regard in that neighborhood outside of that neighborhood that was going on a course reaching out to the people affected by it\nUm family hit by the synagogue itself 'cause our how are they bouncing back you know that takes you to the core and think about your place of worship if you if you go to a place of\nWorship and imagine that gunshot but you know shattered into service and maybe you survive but just moving forward what it's like for everybody else I'm terrible um this is life you move on but it is it's really really really a\nTerrible terrible thing and then I got two emails different kinds of emails one from an Kate how much does the president there for what's happening in Pittsburgh we live in such a divisive thigh any I think you have to say that\nDonald Trump bears the burden for some of the he does he even care was to happen here um you know look this is the situation where\nYou know we've just seen this happen a couple of different times with ... even though Trump has Jewish people in his life some of the the hatred and the divisiveness dams from the top go think\nWell youth that and he has his daughter can converted to Judaism his grandchildren on Jared Kushner his I'm One of a\nYou know other people in the lives so I don't think you can point to I think you pointed out I think you point to the specially if you want to look at his own family um you can point to where we are in the country that as the president I think the responsibility for the president is just and\nIt is to just issue that look we're not hatred and this is wrong\nThen any yet he did say that and I think looking warmed up this week that um\nAnd we can't you know just constant battle that everybody's having over ... we can have battles over ideology is we can\nWe can have keen because they didn't like sports teams we can disagree on tons of things but gosh we live in and just awesome country where we have freedom of speech where we can argue and fight and disagree but kill each other\nOver word over rhetoric over anger\nThat's not even affecting the person who gets riled up I don't get it I mean I Do and I don't I I mean I just wow now here's another one this one is from Julie and Julia Says Kate the I'm\nSo tired of people blaming term for this shooting did he tell people to go into Jewish people especially when you have them in a family love ... love the daughter and his grandchildren give me a break and he's responsible for anti\nJewish rhetoric that's ridiculous and people are just hate on Trump to another view\nTo brag on Donald Trump and I don't think it's right here not the person responsible for the fires that are being cut across the country is a world\nBombing officers religion Carter if it were one of the\nBushes we've said the same things\nI don't know if we would say the same yeah I think we actually I Do um what is the president do afterwards that's always the deal what is the president do to close the fears of the people and we'll probably see more of that because this week but um\nYou know I mean here's the thing we we\nDefinitely are in a polarized nation and we definitely why I always say like sports teams but\nThe week and I said this again I mean to me why can't we just agree and argue\nAnd it's not like someone off her point of view but want to go and kill people I mean come on that's a whole different level but mentally ill this deranged but not thinking clearly even the even the mother of the shooter Bowers that he\nWasn't grounded in reality and that's it I mean not grounded in reality but how do you find those people before they do something horrific like that I mean it goes back to that it goes back to the person and\nYou can you blame can you blame other people around them for that if they're an organization that they're taking orders\nAnd saying they're going to go out and killed

invest just calling for more information about climate change in how companies are reacting to it\nHere to tell us more about the securities and Exchange Commission and these kinds of\nDemands from boards of companies is Andrea Victoria Bloomberg Law corporate governance reporter joining us from our nation's capital Andrea tell our listeners about the securities and Exchange Commission and the kinds of information they're looking for\nFrom the boards of companies that are dealing with activist investors\nProbably I think the act sort of like a rat her earring is accurate and that's common to companies with a proposal that they want to\nPrep Provo and I'm a company can can turn the and say we don't want to have a vote on that and I thought the at the inside out and they they had to hear that I'm having him more input from foreign it'd be really helpful\nTo make their decision um they've gotten some response in the past year they're there and some experimenting with that and that and keep them feedback recently on on what was not helpful\nWill this change what actually shows up at the annual meeting on the agenda for companies\nCould and there was an example of the past year of Duncan that the company from ling on your thinking donor and were able to dodge some investor apathy on the environmental impact of helping single use coffee hard you know take up\nAnd down they did it by demonstrating that does kick out the count for a very small portion of traveling so if more companies can provide that sort of data showing that are the issues raised by a proposal that relevant to corporate now than they could end up you know inviting more votes on these kinds of issues\nBut the securities and Exchange Commission doesn't necessarily have to weigh in on this or does it\nThey don't have to um company you know they could you let them come on to their ballot and go to a shareholder vote at their annual meeting they sometimes challenging but not always an unusually about I think about half of all the proposals that get filed ended up going to about\n... ... institutions today still rely on the big firms you know the you own foreign insecurities or just in your own food

and I don't think mutual funds have the luxury of no not opening the envelope they've got to pay where does all of a sudden up I mean is this a political deal where you care about the election\nAndrew\nIn terms of the\n... you know yeah I mean I mean is it the politicians are going to get involved with this or is it just to narrow for that\n[noise] um well politics are showing up

topic when you talk about what the FCC wants to hear from boards directly about these issues\nEnvironmental social and governance issues we don't know ... that's the reality people need to open those ... well that's a fact and so it's been like a fifty year fact yeah\nBut uh that's always difficult at this point the cycle to determine um and I do think there's more to outside here well so the way

you very much Greg Jared we're broadcasting from the Bloomberg interact to brokers studios joining us of course now is Dave Wilson Bloomberg stocks comments remember descent have an email at the Wilson that Bloomberg dot net that will take it directly to his email newsletter and his charge of the day they will send of course IBM and red hat\nOn focus today but there's a lot of other stuff going on as well\nYeah especially what's notable is what's happening with the auto makers and the auto parts maker zoo we reported that China is looking at a tax cut to kind of jumpstart it's auto industry which and sales aren't doing so well at this point\nAnd possibly reducing the levy by half of lead such a proposal from the company or the country's top economic planning agency so you know you look across the board you see gains\nA GM up about four and a half percent for it up close to six percent to the top performers in the U.S and people have hundred beyond that are on a porch makers are active\nAnd board Warner both up about six and a half percent at the moment\nHold on a second is it fair for us to attribute this really to China's move or to the fact that their earnings weren't as bad as many people thought in fact\nSome people that say they even had some silver linings and then you put in the fact that we were having a more stable kind of backdrop today anyway she likes ... isn't it sort of fair to say it's both or that there is an element of just their fundamentals aren't as bad as people have been expecting\nWell China is the what's new here and you know that's the the the immediate response I mean what you're saying about the earnings certainly\nIs on target based on what we've seen from these companies and beyond that though I mean what is it that's going to keep things going in so much concern about the back and forth in terms of trade between the U.S and China that it would be an issue\nUh you think about you know the the joint ventures that ah the automakers and it's not just the U.S wants to be fair it's also you know European companies like ... to ... ... active in Europe as well so\nUh nonetheless I mean the idea that the what really has become the biggest car market in the world\nOr it may get a bit of a a booster here I mean it's it's going over well certainly going over well with stocks as you mentioned shares of Ford Motor now empire\nBy more than six percent or let's turn a ton of General Motors up four and a half\nPercent are wondering if you can turn your attention not just to uh IBM and red hat but to other companies in the same space this idea that hybrid cloud republic cloud computing is here to stay obviously in that a lot of companies want to get into it and IBM is one of them they're paying thirty three thirty four billion dollars for red hat\nRight and there aren't a ton of companies to sort of do it red had does I mean you have to remember what their roots are ah they're ruining the Lennox operating system which by definition is open source which means you know sure red hat\nHas its own version of clinics but it is sort of a a a competitive product in the sense that\nIt's something that's developed you know a crime around the world it's not proprietary system you know the sort of thing that the you know an IBM might offer on its own so\nYou know ... it's interesting to see a this shift I mean it's part of a a bigger move in terms of you know services you think about the the artificial intelligence that IBM's operate with Watson\nThat sort of thing but it's not necessarily there are a whole lot of other companies that are in the business in quite the same way so you know that that may explain perhaps the lack of reaction for for some stocks than in software anyhow\nSo I I was listening to ... just now and he's getting his business slash and he and his saying that the I'm In a action is actually given that support to markets\nAnd this is interesting to me because IBM as in creating a lot more leverage to actually more than doubling their leverage they got downgraded as a result of this thirty three billion dollar acquisition it's bonds are are declining in price yelled to imply deal to rising I just have to wonder what is it that makes investors stock investors optimistic\nOn the heels of some of these uh these deals\nWell if you take a look at the businesses right now I'm just going in checking out revenue for red hat on the Bloomberg Terminal you're talking about\nUh for this year analysts expecting something on the order of sixteen percent growth and there's a company has delivered Fifteen Percent or twenty percent over time then you go and look at IBM on the same a scale\nAnd you have a whole lotta minus sign this is a company that has really struggled for several years to increase revenue sure and they had growth in the first half\n... corner though rabbit was down so you know that's the optimism that this will help IBM's sorted jumpstart I just saw that word again but there it is you know revive its business\nOkay and we are going to be thinking more about this specific deal in the next segment but I Am curious just more broadly add more singing NASDAQ up one point seven percent hundred up a little bit more than that\nVery much a positive tone in markets is it really just this deal or is it just basically people saying we're sick of a huge loss as we think that probably they will kind of me is not going to find a bed settled electrical by\nWell there's also the argument to be made that the things have gone too far the folks who Goldman Sachs among others were doing just that suggesting that uh\nWhat we've seen in the past couple of weeks wasn't justified by if you will the fundamentals what's going on with the earnings as they're being reported and revenue and so on a given that backdrop you you can understand why people might want to take advantage of the declines that we've seen so\nYou know that's a part of the mix as well just you know how much\nIs enough when it comes to us stocks falling here and let's face it the U.S in the five hundred mass to head off you know that temper cent decline that people focus on in terms of you know correction territory so that's another plus\nFor stocks here and there's a stock though the mood and the other direction completely and this has to do it the first data the shares down a little bit more than ten percent this of course the company that the partners with financial institutions providing electronic payments debit cards credit cards prepaid cards\nAnd a moving that money around from merchants to customers\nDisappointments for their latest quarter in terms of earnings and revenue as far as this year goes they're cutting their profit forecast so you know doesn't matter what the market backdrop as when you disappoint like that it tends to get taken out of\nShares thanks very much\nQuite like that it tends to get taken out of your shares\nThanks very much Dave

I I Want to push back on that arbitrage well the shares are down more than Seventeen percent I'm Talking about IBM right now so far a year to date so for shares to continue their declined today\nNot that much but still it's a sort of the Clinton to continue this decline when it seems like the un is for defying the fastest growing segment of their entire business which is the cloud or should be the fastest growing segments\nThen it should be much more positive reception I mean it's just basically saying that they are overpaid\nBut do you mean it's an expensive for sure it's about nine point fulltime sales which is higher than\nYou know with Microsoft paid for linked in the article paid for ... absolutely I mean right now you're not going to be able to find a saw fit opposite for cheap so that's not going to be easy for sure the question is going to be how IBM monetize is on this red hot base as well as this you know the products that they are developing\nI'm a big risk for us his execution at this point this is again a you know a larger stock was acquisition IBM is done or buy multiples are compared to anything that they have done in the past so there there there's a lot to do here a but strategically it's it's a good deal for them\nLet me just see if I can understand this hybrid cloud is if you're a big business and you have some proprietary software system that you spent ten years developing\nAnd you want to start to migrate certain portions of this ... to the cloud it's called the hybrid because that means some of it is at the clouds and some of it's still resides on at the on premise and you still get the yell at your IT person yes okay\nIs that growing or is that just to catch a game that's being played because all of the corporate customers recognize that it's better to move it to Amazon Web services it's better to move it to Google but they just can't do it fast and\nYou cannot do it fast enough plus you have to do a lot of engineering to do it so that cost a lot of money and remember IBM is the largest the services company so it will help those who are already in those ... they're already making those sales calls now they just get to sell them something out there you get then something else and something that is far more valuable than they don't ... from before\nOkay I'm going to focus on the side because that's what I Do ... and looking at its bonds which are falling out of bed today the biggest to fighters among that's been great bonds not a huge surprise that some ... downgraded them to an a from a plus\nAnd put them on and watch for further downgrades because they're going to be more than doubling the leverage in order to complete this deal how does that sort of square with your understanding of the company given how much debt it has and how much more it's going to have to incur for this acquisition\nYou know they'll have to be very disciplined about cost they've ... they've also said that they're not going to buy shoes for a couple of years I'm going forward dividends going to be fine it seems from the comments so the question is can they really see the end of the day I mean this is all about tend to grow the talkline business or not\nIf they're able to use the leverage because of um red hot to\nIncrease their top line that is going to make a huge difference this company hasn't shown gross I mean you could tell me I don't know how many Eighteen twenty or ... ...\nThis company hasn't shown gross I mean you could tell me I don't know how many ...

I mean we have the ten year a little over three percent\nAnd they said the market has you know digested that supply fairly well so far but you know there might be a limit that breaking point now where it does kind of add ... to ... a better economy and tightening than does as well as you know\nA wonderful they're due to some headlines just crossing the Bloomberg Terminal President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani is talking about the prospects of a presidential interview with a special counsel Robert Mueller uh Giuliani says the president will answer Muller only if a broader deal is reached\nOr we're going to have more on this uh throughout the afternoon here on Bloomberg Radio but as we continue this conversation was about uh the the refunding and the possibility of a a record breaking a refunding from treasury what does that say about are the prospects for\nOverall growth is the administration is sort of saying at this point that you know the argument that they had made that the tax cuts were going to a spur longer term economic growth that would help to pay for the tax cuts is that sort of a being a belied by this refunding\nWell we we have seen growth pick up to these hair right on by ear right that so far it hasn't been on pace enough to make up for the increase shortfall for more spending things so that's why they're having issue more that and personally because of that as you guys mentioned\nThat's why they're having to issue more that and for early because of\nYou guys mentioned but you know there there is some discussion that navy after this refunding which like I mentioned the four corners in a row of increase in these auction site that\nThe treasury navy able to kind of like stand pat for now although at very high level you know it's not like it is going down but maybe for these coupon daring debt they won't have to increase so much more\nUh and they can do a lot in their short term securities treasury bills but you know when we are the high level and so far we haven't seen the growth enough to make up for that shortfall you mentioned\nAnd we should point out that the quarterly refunding announcement comes on guess what day Nathan and lead was will tell them is is it going to be a week from tomorrow now a hollow\nWeaned that all ... and\nThe editors or not already it was ... was regarded Bloomberg does rates are ...\nComing up from ... policy power and law chief justice John Roberts pilots the Supreme Court further to the right with a new member Brett Kavanaugh of course but first before we get to the rest of the show let's go to Bob most checkout morals and national news from our Bloomberg interactive brokers studios by\nPeter Nathan thank you yet another is suspicious package has been discovered linked to others turned up in the mail last week addressed a prominent critics of president Donald Trump this makes Fifteen\nHis votes had been consistently conservative with a few exceptions to Sandra now\nCertainly in the center in that sense I'm a ... that he will ... is the one who will be providing a vote for something very frequently but he but as Justice Kagan was suggesting in those remarks\nHe's unlikely to be the kind of justice where you go into a cave like we did in an abortion case when Justice Kennedy was on the court\nCourt where you wouldn't be sure which way he was gonna end up going with with the chief justice is more in most cases likely to be that we're pretty sure that he is going to reach a conservative outcome it's more a question of how far will he go\nWell in your story you describe Robert history on the court and how he helped support you shipped by much usually an increment tell us about that\nSo we've seen this in several cases are one example has to do with the voting rights act a ... there was a big decision a called Shelby County a few years ago that struck down a core part of the voting rights act\nWhile the court actually have a reach that result a few years earlier they had another case a called Northwest Austin municipal utility district\nUh but the court stopped short and essentially what they said was hey there's a good chance we're going to strike down this provision of the law but we're going to give Congress a chance to change the law first\nCongress didn't act and then the court went further\nSo uh it's a kind of decision that that is ... it's it's an incremental decision a male ultimately reach that same spot that some of the hardcore conservatives want but the way to Justice Roberts\nSeems to like the operate is doing it and doing something in a couple steps so that it doesn't seem like quite as big of a shock when you get to the the ultimate point\nBut there are times when he doesn't take that step\nThere are times yes ah the biggest example is probably in the affirmative action contacts uh he uh famously wrote in a cave\nA involving a a high school and and second and a middle school integration he wrote that the way to the ... to stop discrimination on the basis of race if a stop discriminating on the basis of race\nIn other words uh when we need to be colorblind here and not a science students to school based on their race and uh one would imagine that would apply and they uh college context as well in the area of race he does seem to be more willing to go a bit further and a bit a bit more boldly\nSo he has certain powers as the chief and there is no longer the swing vote as Justice Kennedy how much power does he have beyond that of the other justices to shape what cases the court takes and how they're decided\nHe really doesn't have much power at least in terms of his formal or a powers they all get one vote when it comes to the ... take the cases to take it takes four justices to agree to agree to hear a case\nOn his power is going to come in part by the fact that he is that that middle justice whose vote\nOr the conservatives will need if we get to a case where they're going to overturn and think about overturning roe v Wade for example or the conservatives are may well think we have four votes to do that but we don't want to take up a case I consider that until we know that we have\nA chief justice with us so I just by by virtue of his position has the potential fifth vote he's going to have a lot of power just like what\nPosition has the potential vote he's going to have a lot of power\nJust like what areas are there this term wherever we might be seeing liberal conservative split those five four decisions\nShow for her it's interesting we have very few and and the court just in the last few days was sort of ducked a couple of more cases very few big hot button issues but there are a few things in the pipeline that are going to be hard for the court to avoid\nShow there's another case appeal pending involving partisan gerrymandering case out of North Carolina\nI'm a four four boring technical reasons there's going to be hard for the court not to pick up that case it when they do there's probably a very good chance to say you can't challenge or a voting map as being a so partisan it violates the constitution\nAnd there's a percolating case involving a President Trump's effort to rescind the DACA program for the for any deportation for some young immigrants or if a lower courage go against the president is on math is going to be very hard for the Supreme Court to say no we don't want to take this case\nAnd those are the types that are very likely to lend themselves to five four decisions\nAlmost out of time here but today what did the court ducked today\nSo it it it it's actually duck may have been the the wrong word to use the they did or the ... when the voting a case that they that they refused to take the day [noise]\nUm there are a couple of pending cases June that a very interesting one involving a Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood one involving a forty foot cross it as a war memorial in and outside of Washington Here where the court has not

Carroll humid terms we're going to get into that later in the show I was Shannon petty piece one of our White House reporters at you know but we also do need to not forget that we're in the midst of earnings season that does seem to be a big driver of the markets for better or worse at\nThis point well let's not forget too big tech companies reporting that sweet Facebook after the class tomorrow apple after the crowds on Thursday and we've already heard from a lot of big players but that will be watching these closely especially when you've got to market environment that's pretty volatile\nWell when you said too big tech companies are reporting I thought you were gonna say reporting that they were going to merge\nThat red hat\nIs such a fascinating company that's another story I'm really looking forward to getting into a little more but let's get into the markets now or with Joe and day job wise and tell markets editor for Bloomberg and the coast of what you miss of course coming up at four pm Wall Street time and Dave Wilson socks editor\nBut joining us here in New York so days\nTalk to us about these markets bouncing around a little bit in the green but not heavily in the grain shall we say and the NASDAQ is flirting ... right now learning with being even at best what's happened\nI dance and odd ball kind of day and the sense that you know if you look across the market you see games I mean that's been paid five hundred it's more than three to one in terms of individual stocks rising relatives of falling\nAnd then you turn to you know the sang stocks I bring them up because of course you mentioned Facebook with already is out this week those shares\nDown more than one percent and that's a relatively small loss for the group then you see Netflix down three and three quarters percent alphabet\nA company that owns Google down two and a half percent Amazon down for point four percent so\nYou know that kind of weak this is almost like they're they're kind of setting a tone even with the market more generally moving higher he didn't have those keys stocks that are being left behind so you know it's enough on a day like today a it's a kind of be a drag on the market\nSo Joe coming in here what are you talking about on the desk what are you looking at such as people come at you at at the stalwart\nAh I'm really interested in the ongoing weakness in tech stocks are particularly I mean seeing Amazon false so much again today Netflix week again today Muslims or author loads of the day although not by that much and you know there's ... there's a lot of\nHalf baked serious for what's going on in this market and nothing is quite satisfy she can say okay there's economic slowdown but then why aren't credit spreads were sort of maybe a technical but that doesn't work\nBut the ... the change in the um views towards tech stocks is really striking right now and I'm In particular struck by like the divergence between Netflix and an apple because remember Netflix of produce great earnings on a subscriber growth basis\nBut I still have enormous capital demand whereas apple is probably the strongest balance sheet and the world and that stock is barely anywhere Ava ties\nTo it feels to me like this is mark and telling stocks particularly tech stocks give us the money we're not interested in anything else we want we want cash right now we're not interested in your long term growth storm coming it's coming it's coming yeah way we want to see companies and right now are really stable on a\nCash flow basis well and I guess they do when you start to look at valuations of ... versus maybe the overall market and you see the run into these teams in the tech teams I mean maybe you start to re think well maybe I put money elsewhere maybe evaluations make more sense somewhere else in the market\nDay maybe that may well be part of the mix too but you know Joe's point about you know give it to me now really shows up when you look at this month's performance among the are made industry groups in the U.S and the five hundred even though you've got an index is down more than ... percent two groups are higher\nWanted other utilities and they talk about ... relatively stable there's there's a relatively high dividends certainly have that then you know consumer staples food beverage tobacco which sort of fits the bill as well and we're real estate sounds not down all that much so you look at those groups\nYou know and it's clear that you keep more up focusing on new give it to me now as opposed to you know pay for the growth that's coming down the line and may not be as fast as it's been simply because a lot of these companies that are so big now\nTo Dave's point I think the ... is really important and interesting because if it were just about rising rates than utilities wouldn't be that good because do part of the appeal is dividends and higher rates eat into the value of those dividends\nBut if you reframe their thinking away from race to sort of financial conditions in overall anxiety then suddenly those same utilities become a lot more appealing right just on the basis of the fact that they're really consistent and we'll probably thrive in an environment\nKennedy's your fourth best performing groups have far this year so we've certainly seen our performance ah yeah so are you guys thinking it all back on the terms and we've also got you know that's how they say next week he got the jobs you come friday I in terms of possible a catalyst for either selling or buying into this market\nWell I'm looking at them if only because if you check out the defense contractors they're having a lousy day to day whether you're talking about Boeing and Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman Raytheon\nOne idea that pops up is you know maybe the Republicans lose control both houses of Congress at a minimum\nAnd so that leads to concern about you know where the defense budget goes from here are they going to need cuts to keep everybody happy or at least you know be able to get something done in terms of legislation so\nThose sort of things are are definitely out there in the markets at this point\nWell and just taking a look at what people are reading about it is to try and get a read on you know whether people's minds on the markets on politics most red story in the past our Hillary Clinton a possible run in twenty twenty quote I'd like to be president ... to\nAn interview and to be president Jo thanks um you know and\nAnd also New York's federal tax deduction workaround pays off that of course drawing a lot of interest stress relief from our readers and customers are here in the New York Harry alright Joe was without markets editor for Bloomberg coast what'd you miss\nGoing to send you off the TV Dave Wilson stocks editor for Bloomberg you'll be back with us with your chart and then your stock of the day you wanted a debate\nAnd let's do that at some Bloomberg Markets by the day one number that tells us a lot number is four and this is courtesy of our producer and also for our producer pop right in with a five game at ... LA Dodgers and the ... World Series the Boston Red Sox have now line for titles this century\nAfter not winning any titles for practically\nThe century were very very happy\nFor fall and all the Sox fans are like\nSo we're very very happy\nFor fall and all the Sox fans are well how many socks\nCommon man this is like the older you are doing a of late listen I'm a jolted Braves fan you know they just got wiped out in the very early part of the then I have I and Paul Brown and can I can attest that I've been very supportive of his his uh\nBad Red Sox have it all up and you see that Paul when you're not around I'm just telling you he was in the LA Dodgers are you a letter in the news that Bloomberg Businessweek ...\nAlong with that Jason Kelly where life or my Bloomberg interactive brokers studios let's get some more of a national headlines for that we got about moving in the eleventh Rio news or impact\nBig news today was Angela Merkel is stepping down as the leader of a party um she said she's not going to run again in two thousand and Twenty one for chancellor she's been the\nEither if you want to use leading light or she has been the anchor of the European Union one of the main issues you got right now is Italy which is say this is our budget if you don't like it too bad this is the budget and they're heading for a showdown in my opinion with the European Union just when the\nLeader if you will of the EU is to become a lame duck that that's one of the big issues\nAs well and one of the things you point out is this idea of what's been working is not working anymore we're talking about that at the top of the show that the tech named the big tech names have really driven this ah for so long so where do you go from here where do you look\nFor some comfort when they in terms of sectors are names way where did where states\nI'll tell you I'll give you my opinion about that right now yes I think the appreciation plays especially with the\nUh high tech or is over for the moment we're ... we saw the market almost three hundred and fifty up today and now it's\nDown to about fifty five um my favorite sector at the moment is to be closed and fund sector\nOr I Can't give you a name because it says but only for a client for the for recline in mind but basically there to read there's um\nA a fund connected to oil and energy the milk ... their convertible bond funds and they're all paying double digits in paying monthly\nSo I think a very good place to be right now is the cash flow play where you get money every month and you can adjust to what the market is doing because of\nSomething that we heard from our own job wise in dollar earlier that this is a sort of for lack of better term you know you make a lot of movie references I'll make one here like I was going to show me the money kind of market\nThis is not a you know pay me later this is you know mine's a little more modern soon you know Jerry Maguire [laughter] I mean I like I like high anxiety that's fine but you know this idea of like I Want to get paid I Want to get paid on a regular basis is that the mood we're in at this point\nI think so I think that's the better play because appreciation plays right now are working I mean you just have to look at me and say their network and uh\nWe've got the midterm elections coming up which could be very problematical over they follow them for the markets I think honestly there's not going to be any blue wave that if it looks like a\nThe Democrats are going to take over Congress I think we're going to get a very negative reaction in the markets\nUm guy that said the Italy problem you've got the China problem with the terror of and the Chinese economy would certainly is doing\nAs well as it used to do she got a bunch of factors to the main thing that markets and I'd rather have the cash isn't like is that Jason\nYeah that makes sense I mean why do you think is the most problematic um I don't know factor markets if you will in terms of the investment environment right now he's a actual fundamentals in terms of growth slowing down higher rate what is that\nNo I'll give you a two year old one is the terms and the uncertainty that surrounds them in the second is the fed and what they've been doing I think the fed is a big cause of this [noise]\nMarkets currently they've been raising interest rates in my opinion too much too fast\nWe've into a new Kashkari the president Minneapolis fed to take that same basic view that hold on like we should slow down I don't think there's any reason to return to some kind of normalcy after ten years since the\nDebacle of Lehman Brothers but normalcy was before that than what normalcy is now a decade later in my opinion are two different things and I think the fed and their continual push to raise interest rates which of course affect mortgages it affects\nYou know any kind of about money it affects individuals\nOr how lock loans are home equity loans it's just causing a problem are pushing interest rates up decide this quickly\nWe've already seen certainly some of that\nPushing interest rate to decide this quickly\nRight we've already seen certainly some of that

going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he has certainly I think\nFound those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well a free\nAnd listen to deal with Trump rallies um you have to connect to nothing in different ways and so today we're actually also running ads for them you know we need to support the Republican base to support these races that you know um there's a lot of congressional races as you know and so the more message we can get to those voters help we get them to show can understand that they're voting for their kids' future\nYou know by doing nothing to vote Republican because that's the best opportunity for their children to have successful last\nHow important is Republican turnout for these historic midterms\nTurnouts everything enthusiasm look I think we have the rights\nThe public can turn out for these historic midterms well\nTurn out to everything I Do is you have some like I think we have the right track wrong track wrong track going or direction I think enthusiasm picked up I think he's all the Kavanaugh bump I think you see the caravan bump 'em I think you're going to continue to see that I think the president's working harder than any president in history hitting all these rallies\nAnd I I think that's going to drive a lot of success and that's going to pop up enthusiasm significantly through the eyes and picks up and I'm Republican turnout goes that will definitely not be a blue wave which I think is already clearly showing\nLet me ask you this now let's look forward here to a little bit to twenty twenty campaign switch gears here trying to look a little bit for tell me what are some of the key concepts as you look to Tony Tony\n[laughter] you know I have to be honest with you I mean I've been show laser focused on twenty Eighteen and that I have spent in re really an infrastructure and planning but there's so much\nStill to be decided after what we see how Mitt terms I mean when I was in the house is going to have a big tradition and how this is wrong you know the way the president has to pay that or you know do things if he has a democratic controlled house um\nBut I think the things that are key already is one is a very early recognition ... marketing which is building a database that so\nI'm directly connected with the possible voters you as a sixty five sixty to depend on you know what year you know sixty million voters will do for the president and if I could have the cell phone number of every single one of those may call I flood easier I could just directly talk to them\nUm I think by election day I'll be almost two two thirds of them in some kind of direct contact\nUm tens of millions of those in databases with our phone number the email address is\n... advantage of of running this campaign like a corporation instead of running a just like a campaign western lots I'm\nUsed to be that you just came out the campaign you were just ran for a few months and and it was all you just quickly spray you know your your advertising everywhere and you can do for you now we're able to really build a system and and build a marketing system in place in a voter contact systems that can start that worked out and we've already started that\nWe've seen some of these democratic candidates possibly emerged um and maybe the former mayor of New York city Michael Bloomberg Eric Holder Kamala Harris maybe Cory Booker from New Jersey lean even heard Joe Biden or possibly even Hillary Clinton one more time totally has the most viable out of all these candidates\nHillary Clinton would be the gift that keeps on giving 'em however I look I'm not focused on that yet and they got a long fight between them um you know\nI'm not sitting there trying to decide which one I think it's better now I mean if I did I probably wouldn't be a ... I'm a you know if I had my own thoughts on that um but for the most part or we're going to see them\nReally territory each other it's not like they all can run on\nWho doesn't like Trump more um they are going to have to have other differences and that's going to turn them on each other um and I think you're going to see a pretty grueling democratic\nPrimary socialism seems to becoming part of the Democratic party pot for we've seen some races out here in New York where some very progressive candidates at one of these races Denise says America understand what's socialism really is\nLook I don't know if I'm going to be the best ... exactly what the kids of America understand I Will tell you that what's happened in this country and I happened to him or her party is driving that party to the left\nUm I think it's a mistake for this country but I think you're seeing that you know with the ... I called the Bradley effect on the superdelegates should remove you know the super delegates from the Democratic party a primary\nUm I think you see that now California also pushing to be on Super Tuesday I think these changes are going to have a huge effect on what northern California's view is of what the Democratic Party should be giving them a lot of power in the state of the cat is which is probably going to drive a very socialist candidate I think you see that so that\nThis Paolo Alto effect I call it and I said today the ... mafia such control over kind of the mess gene of this group um and they are really drive that direction I'm a regardless of how much money they have in the bank how much money and how well he would have gotten over capitalism um they tend to maybe feel guilty for that\nI'm a I think it's a mistake I think it hasn't been successful anywhere in the world and I don't think it would be here\nWhat do you think the most significant thing President Trump has done to help the average American\nThe ability to have a dream and to dream for something better is what most people wish for there are people that aren't ... you know they have other goals and um but I did well she'll just they dream but I have an option whatever the opportunities for them and I think for a long time this\nCouple of generations um have really just not seeing that opportunity since the baby boomers and um I think what President Trump wanted to do to make America great again was to bring back that opportunity at the baby boomers had\nOf of starting a business only homes and do something amazing Brad parcell thank you so much right when he want American and yet we're\n\nMaking Christians to lead on this hour one American news a man suspected of joining ISIS has released
