number two it was used to put off her testimony Brett Kavanaugh's be accused of rape assault\nUm indecent exposure wild drunken a center right parties have to just sit and take it without being able to testify for a week right allegedly on the grounds that Dr Ford because of her trauma was afraid to fly well that just went out the window so that's a pretty big why\nDo you ever been in the committee wouldn't go to her oh they said they would so the whole thing was is just a sham she doesn't know when it happened what year it happened how many people were there were the house was what the neighborhood was who died requiring whichever ... sided than\nI have all refuted it they didn't know he did not have been reviewed and what you said your name colds are no more Mr White guy I'm gonna I'm going to post a link to this too that maybe the her latest book is resistance is you do have the top hitting left last has lost its brought to mind and we are we seeing that with\n... we really are in and I got to tell you I don't know I'm I'm kinda dumb and ... mostly white although my skin is much more Italian ... but I'm a white guy and I'm watching it in Ford is white and blue sweat Nick is white\nAnd and there were white men on the left or asking questions and they were really mad Blumenthal lawyers face off he was really mad at 'em all these people everybody involved with stories wide except for Deborah Ramirez and we can argue about whether Hispanics or white or black or would the races but this is not this has never been about race he'd wanted to go there\nUm it's but this has has been a cliche for some time I'm I've been noticing this Hillary you probably don't remember this but in one of her slams of Trump during the campaign she said something to the effect of um he has an odd fondness for white autocrats\nI Do remember that no I yeah\nSo okay cast your mind once again we're going to think about actual fact they're\nCats your mind over the world and think of where there are dictators autocrats or something like that it may have the white authoritarian rulers\nWell I I think I'd start with the entire continent of Africa I Would move my way up to the middle east we would get lots of autocrats authoritarian rulers in in in the far east\nUm I guess she's talking about ... and who is the only white autocrats I can think of he's not exactly start one he's on even Khrushchev Bush he throws in that's the one thing people like me started to notice oh my gosh white is just\nIt's the way Hannity uses the word literally it's an intense a fire it has no actual meaning other than\nUm it's really bad why\nIt's so bad because of his white news is colds are no more Mr White guy ... you cite a bunch of these quotes from from the idiots on the left the media\nYou've got to understand they have all these white men no because he was one of the next one is women across the nation should be outraged that white men senators are doing this to them and there's been some discussion but ... what happened to be all white men I mean\nI don't understand is there's so much anger against white men and show much guilty in white men themselves that this crap works in\nA it doesn't work on may nor me and I go out as I Am so why do I um\nIt's very strange and I also take issue I mean I at least understand the logic of saying it should be women\nWomen understand massage any and that shouldn't be a panel of women questioning and alleged sexual assault um accuser\nUm but the last time um that I can remember\nWhere I'm somebody one big for don't worry women understand massage any and end violence against women was when they pick the OJ jury\nMember that was Marsha Clark big idea I'm black white I don't care as long as they're women they will bond with with um what's her name I'm Nick Nicole Brown Simpson's um didn't work out for oh no oh I guess the jury didn't see the point\nSo I think it's idiotic to say that only women should be should be questioning actually don't you have all these rape laws as Janine bureaus ed right bless her soul she said you know for years I've been prosecuting sex crimes cases and I was prosecuting them under laws written by white men\nI mean at the top feel when he wrote about America he wrote about\nHow the ... the crime of rape in ... in contrast to even you know other European boundaries which was what he was familiar with the crime rate is so much more serious in America than anyplace else it is just barely seconds\nTo murder this is what the respect for women in this new country is a lot um and it has always been ... wow American women don't know what they're asking for [laughter] if they want to throw over the white male patriarchy because the white male patriarchy has been pretty terrific for women\nNo one really has been a gym culture but even the book is resistance as you do have a trope hitting left lost its collective mind she's written this article no more missed\nLucas resistance is futile ... lost its collective marches written this article no more Mr White guy you're just back to the OJ trial for a second you have to give the the the jurors a pass and you see the blood evidence always show that that that the chances of being him or seven billion to one\nThere was a kid it was at him culture ...\nSo bad [laughter] so it ... the the boat one is going to ask you about this before we run out of time I could ask you about Jeff Flake or if you're in charge of this committee why is he still there when he says I'm not running for reelection what he says that I'm Out a year when he makes all this noise about how Trump is horrible and the director of the country is bad why is that guy that we're\nStill want to be eleven on the Judiciary Committee do you have any

this is John ... show good evening the news for the people of the United states is spectacular because at the last moment the Trump Administration concluded to deal with the Trudeau government in Canada\nFor just starting the NAFTA that was unacceptable to the Trump Administration and embracing a new creature called us MCA which my guess Liz peak up the hill and Fox News and I both agree we can't pronounce so we just spell it out us MCA Liz a very good evening to\nUnited States and Mexico Canada agreement\nA pending approval by the Congress next year and that will itself be\nA short story we are looking at a deal that no one thought would be here for weeks now Liz I mentioned to the audience you have just bear please get Canada done we can't do this without Canada where's Canada will candidates here are you satisfied with what we know so far us embassy a good evening fuel is\nTo and I am satisfied I'm actually shared by what they accomplished and the reason it wasn't getting done is\nPartly political and partly because there were certain issues and in particular dairy terrorists or that Canada was really unwilling to budge on the political reality is that Justin Trudeau didn't want to seem like a week laying in ... you know facing off against Donald Trump if you remember back at the G seven meetings\nA they had a bit of a contract tall and\nA true does polling went\nThrough the roof for the first time in months because it was considered that he had sort of face down Donald Trump well he didn't want it sort of Nick on that but at the same time his liberal party was getting killed in one election after another and not doing well and here's the thing Canada it's a very export\nDependent economy they needed NAFTA\nCanada is a very export dependent economy they needed NAFTA they needed to get a a treaty in place so that their major export market was still in place\nA and so they had to come to the table I just thought it was a matter of time but I also thought it was incredibly important to have a when if you want to look at it that way and I do before the midterm elections because let's face it Donald Trump has gone after they eat you and a China and our partners in NAFTA\nA and practically everybody else in the sun and you can only do that so long without people saying where's the bacon where's the beef\nAnd finally he brought home the bacon this deal I think\nA is quite a good one it does give our dairy farmers greater access to Canada without getting into the weeds there was a sort of and run the dairy farmers had done around uh the terrorists in Canada which are on average about two hundred and Seventy percent [noise] but then Canada block that\nAccess and so this now is on blocked and our dairy farmers will be able to export more to Canada I'm also poultry and eggs are those are the products also are going to be more freely flowing north\nUh and then the other big thing of course those automobiles and the supply chain is being kept in place a Trump did push through an increased a local content regulation which is really to keep\nA ... auto parts from coming from Germany or China and basically sort of wheeling their

John ... show my colleague was peak of Fox News as well as a blogging at the hill here to comment on the domestic economy we've dealt with the overseas economy the trade negotiations but now\nThe market responded very well to the U.S embassy a news lives and here we are in the fourth quarter there's a lot of consumption going on in the United states I have not heard anything about is slowing momentum if anything I've seen house prices maintain their heights\nMaybe there's a shortage in supply at the starting and have you heard any interruption and the shopping or in the consumer confidence lose\nNo I I think you're looking at a spending being very strong in the third quarter and what everything I read suggests it's going to be very strong as well and the fourth quarter we're talking about growth three and a half percent kind of territory\nA look when you have the Federal Reserve chair a Jeremy pal talking about the U.S economy being almost too good to be true\nAnd talking about how there's not going to be any recession until twenty twenty uh you know that's a that's a pretty good indicator and I don't think he is someone who is political I don't think he's saying it uh except that is what he sees a and that's in spite of the fact that the fed is going to be a\nIncreasing interest rates pretty steadily throughout the next year so\nRight now um I don't see in the marketplace any excesses that are particularly worrisome there is a lot of dead around but gosh guess white folks when you have one percent interest rates forever\nPeople borrow instead of issuing equity or whatever uh and that has had some impact probably on stock prices but and it also has meant that interest or that the debt levels have gone up\nBut it's not at all that kind of situation we had in two thousand seven two thousand eight when we all knew something was profoundly wrong there is no sense of that today whatsoever\nAnd the market is high and Main street is seeing a strong dollar so we're looking at a good Christmas season I've not seen a negative report on that in fact what I have seen is shortage of workers to stuff up the retail\nOh that's right in fact all the retail companies are out there raising Amazon today announced that they were going to be going wrong Fifteen dollars an hour for all their employees others have raised wages to\nMake sure that they have enough seasonal workers and the numbers that the increase year over year target I think was twenty percent they're not alone in that\nThat that suggests that they're looking at incredibly good indicators are for the cause of upcoming holiday season and don't forget\nFor many companies that's like two thirds of the year so it's hugely important I think we're going to have a gang busters fourth quarter\nAnd you know the question is then does all of that translate right well for the Republicans in the mid term elections it's hard to imagine that it won't it's hard to imagine that Americans are going to be\nI'm completely indifferent to the idea that Democrats could raise their taxes or at least roll back the tax\nCuts that came through early in this administration\nUh people are saying there are other big concern is health care and I would say they're\nA Donald Trump talked about that today in his meeting with the electric or his speech to the electrical workers group a ... and talking about how the Republicans have done such a great job on health care rates are going to go up next year they really if it's if that is true they need to really broadcast that because boy that's not the perception\nYes this last minute who lives it is it is we're going to watch the the reporting on Capitol weary\nIt's horrifying and the only good here's one thing that I think is good news today I read an article I think it was up on real real clear politics\n... seconds go ahead\nYeah just challenging a Christine Blasey Ford's explanation of the so called second door I recommend to people not because I don't know if it's right or wrong but it's time that someone began looking at her\nReally no one has asked her any hard questions are looked into her background and

would be fine somebody wants to leave the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can shoot me yeah well let's look at what point their values are just being or choose to be happy because hey\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint or so of again a I'm not sure that I see that as

independent countries briefly and the ... the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow\nExactly the kind of very very significant differences in a state character\nThat healthy and is talking about so all all of us are look back and are appalled at the at the question of of slavery but we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nA had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the public character and culture of the states and that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states it just meant that if\nIf you wanted to live in that that kind of a place then then you would live in Massachusetts and

their own nation and wish to see it succeed in its competition with others are addressed further if you would this notion that nationalism equals hatred\nWell I I I don't think the nationalism equals hatred I'm just saying that that isn't it an extremely common\nYes a thing to to to say people say a nationalism is racism Gina phobia there's like a a a a list of ... ... ... it's like is it do you have this political point of view that nations should be independent and then you were a violent person\nAnd the ... my goal in that section of the book is to is not to deny that they are all sorts of nasty nationalist because there are plenty my goal is to to say well\nWhat is your alternative fuels alternative is some kind of a universal ideal ... like like a a like a communist in international or an Islamic international or or or or a crusading Christian international that's going to conquer the world all of the alternatives\nFor 'em to independent nations\nProduce at least as much hatred is nationalism does\nAnd I I think that this is also true for what today is called liberal international ... which is the the uh the the idea that there's there's some some\nA group of like minded enlightened liberal thinkers in the United states and uh and Europe who have the right answers Ken and Ken just roll the whole world I think that that that is creating\nIf you take a look at the

out he made some comments about cabin I made some comments about Dr Ford\nAnd it's coming to maybe an end to this upcoming weekend whether or not judge Kavanaugh get confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice I ever medicate the lady America Tonight so we're hanging out and we hang out you know I always say this left of left right of rights somewhere in between or you know like labor yourself anything\nYou are always welcome to the party eight five five to six sixty to eighty three if we were doing an artificial poll of what I've heard from many of you on whether he gets confirmed or not you think my numbers are accurate that there is a sixty percent chance that he gets confirmed I Would say I don't know we might be able to jump that up to the next couple of days\nI I feel like from what we're hearing for for what I'm hearing from people who I Know on the hill that flake is definitely leaning toward confirming and that Collins and Murkowski are playing it close to the vest but one of them\nMay as well confirm him and then that the numbers would add up no matter what happens with whatever's going on\nUm the rhythm role of the going through their redacted ness of what's in the FBI reporter what can be released or what ... what will the public know and how do we debate the but it is up to the senator's that's it they take a vote wants to vote goes then that's what you got\nSo I think\nI think that that vote does happen this weekend and most people in Washington or staying the same thing barring I don't know something unforeseen\nBut it doesn't look like that doesn't look like doing anything unforeseen it's yadda yadda here's what you do we have this investigation we're only going to go deep you know it was through so many people\nAnd then um that's it then we will let me move on from from there by the way speaking of moving on it's so interesting because the longest game in\nPost season for the cubs just wrapped up the national league wildcard game the Rockies when it in Thirteen to one\nTo one over the uh\nThe Chicago Cubs so the Rockies get their ... first postseason when since two thousand and eight how 'bout that I'm longest winner take all game and postseason history winner take all baby so that means it's Colorado\nThe Rockies were threatening all season along in the NFL west\nMaking it very tough for the Dodgers in Arizona Arizona's not even there uh the Dodgers end up claiming the west and then this is how it all ends and for the cubs it was looking good in front of the cubs fans\nBecause it was tied up in the eighth hobby by us with a run scoring double but in the end it does matter because some\nDoesn't look like it doesn't look like it so probably we have our next Supreme Court justice if not there's a short list and some others that would\nAnxiously love to jump into the middle of this re well maybe not love\nWould love to have a shot at being a Supreme Court justice that's for sure because there's no higher on her I think when you get a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land and you've been a judge and this is your profession and you get tapped for that decision that forever stand or can you know ultimately\nMoved the needle in all kinds of directions I mean it's the wow it's the mind blowing and you know we got three branches of government and boom you'd be on the Supreme Court that's a huge huge honor go out to Graham Graham\n[laughter] you know\nCalling in about a ah yeah I was calling in about your interview for Steve Forbes I Know it's kind of old and we've talked about before you and I both believe in what\nAre the poor state for like more the windy city they want Seventeen percent or better\nWell the ...\nThis is the genius of the greatest man that ever lived and that's all he ever request it was a flat tax now why would I Want a pay more and what Jesus\n[laughter]\nYeah they're good to shake good point [laughter] you're right okay\nWell if we do go to Bob biblical term risk you'll find that even in the Bible it tells you that the tribes it better\nAnd ten percent\nThat's based in math I think the thing you should say was the IRS all these ... and everything because most idiots and ten fingers and can't do math with their fingers [laughter]\nYeah that's true with can do your right\nWhy not just American stuff what to act because the world from\nGiving back to the workers will come back\nAnd grow better and stronger and faster because I think it's just like with work if you create more workers you create more income\n\nThat's true you create more income that way I look like\nThese economists and ... senators and everything they want to complicate everything because they like squeezing into three cents out the thing put their pocket because when you do two or three cents ended up being numbers you make pretty good money but you're right\nIt is fun\nBut do you talk about taxes and ah\nYou know you open up in the open up with is Kevin authoring in this country that you're doing their best tried to get rid of truck when you talk a little bit of a bad year well just thing\nOf ... was impeached is I Want someone by the name of my pants burning in doubt

coming from the absolute\nWhy are they part while they're fighting hard with\nIf they do get rid of them it's not like he's calling us that much chair [noise] it'll be my pin it would be might have

to you know yeah you're right yeah like shoot it's like ... year old but the right be careful what you wish for yeah\nYou're right that you know a ... they may be hoping he'd become a part\nOf this but he's been sit behind don't watch Donald take down the swamp and you know he said hey there's a lesson to be learned they may very well get somebody to sit there and bring back the rule the world is going to be religious\n... again it all go back to the Spanish period you know [laughter] can you imagine it up the phone [laughter] ... yeah\nYeah that sounds that sounds cruel\nTo rise right yeah right through the town square yeah\nCrazy [laughter] just to make light of it because all the stupidity here just makes me laugh but it is serious to assert the great so\nIt got to try and you're right you're you're right Meg very serious and very serious and it's an ... in and you don't realize and here's the thing the the idea of the impeachment I don't see that happening at all I mean I there's I don't know that happening it's not going to\nHappen if this conversation is conversation that is just can rattle around in a box it's not it's not happening I'd be done that's not happening\nAnd let let me ask you something because you have probably a little too young but in the seventies they had a lot of senators that we're getting caught at chicken ... you know what I'm Talking about\nYes yes yes a lot I've seen lots of documentaries on during the ... and about a lot of movies yeah yeah yeah absolutely they were they were caught with pride and\nStuff and it was done to them they're still there [laughter] yeah yeah they're doing in the polls political skiing not yeah we're really punished for it they think they may have got a war on and hand slapped another\nThe sickness that disease of\nUh or or just you know the flat out saying to grab the these people it's crazy it's just like I Know for sure but I I Know\nI Know too much about [laughter]\nYou know you and I are alike in that when you know you're much it does it does really payment differently you're right\nBecause sometimes you got to buy your car\nYou got to bite your tongue you you just to let you just let somebody go on when they have no idea when they ... they haven't studied that they haven't looked at it they don't pay attention yeah\nWe have that are selling than I can\nNot only that but there's so many common or ... or so and I have yet you know I mean that's the problem I have been here in this state is that I have the other people you know that's just because they knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody from the south here in the south\nDon't make bank a plane and you know and that's the problem\nAll we had a whole bunch of Democrats that\nRepublican overnight back in Seventy year writer Nixon's period yeah\nAnd this and their families are still carry through that's why I have a hard time trying to speak about anybody oh now a new one good politician and he was a Democrat but yet they were ... they got rid of that one gene Taylor\nAnd ... they're they are they yeah they pretty much a sham on him doing anything but one thing he did do sit\nOn the oh I'm trying to take military committee is not a bad he maintained angles and oh a lot of the\nTerry war bases that they want they want to shut down can't tell the\nCat and he was and he was a lot of them have grim are running out of time with your right he was somebody who fought for that if you if anyone knows anything about gene Taylor he was a representative from Mississippi for congressional district ...\n[noise] one of the sea of radio\nABC News I'm Dave Schreiber on both sides of the political aisle Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has become a rallying cry I had a midterm elections ABC News political director rich ... says both sides are\nDigging in you could see Democrats making the argument particularly\nIn some house races look women deserve to be heard and this is unjust and this is wrong and then I could think you could see the argument made in Trump country maybe some Senate races some big red state Democrats up for re election to say look this is an issue that Republicans have to fight for don't keep him from the bench in really could cut both ways\nStay D.C news political director rich Kline a judge Wednesday will join the oldest son of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin whether allegations he hit a woman in my head should lead to jail time if he can stay in a therapeutic program\nMore so than anything else I've ever done and so it is really a big deal because if you were\nA business owner I mean you can't talk about your business during your car but people think they really resonate with your talk at the same time you can also list your talk all kinds of places to build your own credibility by ear email signature or anywhere you do your bio\nAnd the place to build your own credibility eye ear email signature or\nAnywhere you do your bio or on social media because they had a speaker on that list your topic what you spoke on put your link to your radio and so\nAll of a sudden it open the doors and gains credibility I'd like anything else by the cool thing is even if I only a small number of people watch your talk when people here you had a talk immediately they ... have to listen to this person\nSo yeah it it's a huge game changer boy\nThat's a great tip right there we're speaking with a Corey pray and his book is called the book of public speaking learning to speak and so you said you've done this for sixteen years what's the coolest thing you've ever gotten to do and I know that's a tough question\nWhich is a tough question and I'll I'll I'll leave out at three data stock because obviously that would be an easy answer is we just literally talking about it um so I Would say you know those are the really big moment but you know it isn't it weird because it doesn't relate to speaking at all but you know if the\nTrue answer comes me right away is actually got to be a volunteer fireman for a day\nBecause a a client the meat well a person that um went to school same places me without one of my talk and then told me that he was he work for the fire fire ... fire man and woman person training cool\nAnd asked if I wanted to go through the process of what a volunteer fireman died\nAnd so he invited me ... process and I got to believe that to me that was a pretty exciting moment at again it wasn't speaking at the same time but it came from speaking\nWow very very cool what do you hope people take away from your book\nPeople take away that two things one speaking of tired of that a lot of people think and you know I don't try to scare people out of it but I Want people to realize it's a little harder than people think and I don't mean just\nOn the stage building a speaking business but secondly I Want people to realize that no matter where you start even if you're the person sweating on the stage that almost all of this age\n... they'll all be alert I watched probably more speakers that were terrified on stage and talk more speakers that were terrified when they started to become an amazing speakers then people that were naturally born to do it so I Hope people can read to that and the book and realized\nThat can be learned and I can learn it too so that that would be my whole take away\nI Love that and the because you're on these different stages one thing that happens\nHe talked about being a volunteer fireman for a day and what an awesome experience that was but you also have brushes with fame because when we travel and you're at different events a lot of times there are some celebrities that are on hand and I know you've interviewed a bunch of them do you have a favorite one\nThat I get that question a lot and it's a hard hit the hurt one that they favor let's say interviewer person but I can tell you a and this is still probably a favor because of this reason but very memorable and in fact um there's two that stand out but one is a gentleman named Robin ...\nGrowth amongst all this primary at ten other international best selling book\nAnd I did the interview with him while I had to take and I didn't want to reveal that because I didn't want the interview to be cancelled and so I had to drink water to ease the to the but the factor that uh you don't consider when you're drinking too much water is now I'm going to need to go to the bathroom [laughter]\nAnd so the whole interview ... you'd never know that was kind of a win but at the same time I was pretty distracted in my head the whole time during the interview so it made it very memorable\nAnd then Jack Canfield the chicken soup for the soul creator it took four months to get that interview and there's a whole backstory as to how it would have had to do to actually make that interview come to life and get it\nAnd so because of those reasons\nAnd both of those gentleman delivered and knocked out of the power because of those reasons those would be the most memorable and perhaps along the lines of among the favorites as well\nI absolutely love it that's cool very cool I Love the thing that that had to be something sitting there with your your\nRobbing I only had [noise] luckily one of the Cory but it's a horrible but I don't know how you did that you tried to get it out I Can't [noise] you mean by that I like\nBrutal I pick up this book it's the talk of public speaking learning the queen ... thank you so much for joining us now on the show\nWas my absolute

Brett Kavanaugh everywhere you go you at one point during the day that I don't even know um and then at one point he said it's a damn sad situation and he mocked Dr Ford and kind of took on uh the whole ... thing you'd mocking the beer that you had one beer that kind of thing\nAnd and so it is I'm a he said he said and the FBI is investigating and and the conversation is who is the FBI contact in what's going on with that investigation what's the latest that you know\nI'll go we're getting reports that it could end as soon as tomorrow are coming in a little bit shorter than what we initially expected which was one week limited scope that we were initially told\nA re do know that they have spoken with a number of people ah they have um spoken a mark judge and the other witnesses and now it's basically\nJust a waiting game to see what exactly the results are going to be and how much of it we're going to see\nYou made public a yesterday the president was pressed on this during the um press conference from the oval or in the in the rose garden and he basically avoided that question over whether or not the results are going to be\nMade forty available or is this does go to lawmakers what's your most likely will simply because they don't have their house in order to give them the decision it's likely to come out\nBut there's still some questions over whether or not people will be getting the um [noise] for account of what exactly the FBI and looked at um [noise] you know we do know that the vote for this is going to be taking place a little bit later this week according to Mitch McConnell are quite likely on Sunday a due to the\nProcedural stuff so they still need to take 'em and you know sort of the arcane rules are ... and what not um but this does not look like it's going to be slowing down a well lets them do seem to be moving in the a\nIt certainly is what everybody's talking about really honestly and it's it's just like sports\nSome ... some say nay some say it's ridiculous where we ever all pass the scrutiny cast if we went back\nTo our lives to when we were college and younger than that in high school um and you know this is kind of stuff that happened or it's exaggerated some say it's pathetic and awful and sickening and wrong and then a great swimming\nAnd you can find this conversation both sides of this conversation happening everywhere right\nThe latest greatest of their heads because just like I said this that this is a song that we've been thing and now for a really over a week is is exactly what you heard about the FBI investigation McConnell talked about so many of the senators want at least parts of the FBI report on the\nA nominee relief that the the latest this\nShouldn't be release in ... people able to see

public now the Republican Tom killers\nFrom North Carolina who sits on the Judiciary Committee said he would have no issue with lethal summary of it being made public so why don't we just explain what it means so people don't draw these conclusions they gather information that's left up a tough draw the conclusion so of course why not release it\nI mean honestly why why not and we know the deal here we're talking about three people\nAnd I'll say it again because numbers are important we do is segment\nUsually a couple of times a week on numbers\nWe can cap so we know that we can count that there has to be a minimum fifty votes in the Senate to have Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court the swing votes our Senator Susan Collins from Maine Lisa Murkowski from Alaska both Republicans Jeff Flake a Republican of course Arizona\nAnd Lisa Murkowski from Alaska both Republicans Jeff Flake a Republican a force Arizona\nAnd they're all reserving their final judgment on cabinet until the FBI finish the lean is that flake will lean in his direction and who knows really about the other two saying one thing I don't know not really releasing their thoughts so it is a question of when they take the vote\nThe public will get access to this report I Believe it or summer here or whatever I Can't imagine\nI won't be when the FBI investigative sexual harassment claims against now Justice Clarence Thomas Anita Hill the final report in lake but NPR got a four page affidavit from hell in which the alleged years of harassment by Thomas and publishing the information and that forced the committee\nTo hold a second round of hearings to address the accusations and then we know how it all ended up in the end\nSo Mitch McConnell\nThe Senate majority leader is signaling caution about all this saying that the senators will have access to it then reiterated and you heard what he said that it will vote\nDianne Feinstein the committee's top them said that the report can't be released and said I don't know what's going to be in it and after that we'll find out\nSo they are going to be all the senators want to be briefed by the FBI if they say at least twenty four hours before senators take a procedural vote to advance nominations\nSo it could be a weekend could be Saturday could be Sunday before we know you know again what would happen with this and then once he gets in I mean if he is approved and then you know the beat goes on but what if he is not\nWhat if he is not confirmed and then what happens then there is a list of course I mean there's always been a list of the list of people who\nAre are being considered for that position and the list would be bumped up whoever the next name is on the list and there are certainly a slew of them we've talked about them in the past\nWho would that be and if you look since Nineteen eighty Supreme Court nominees who were eventual confirmed waited an average about forty two days before hearing and Seventy days from nomination to confirmation\nSo the current justices on the bed until this great story in the last you know post about these numbers on an average forty eight days for hearing Seventy two overall so for Republicans keep the Senate in November they have two extra years to confirm nominees me I'm\nSo a a whopping head of the Democrats represent a state that voted for Trump in twenty sixteen so if we're looking at the lean and where it goes and you look at the you look at the short list of potential nominees cabinet was the most conservative according\nTo bomb according to a specifically judicial comments based system because they do all this political science research and then they take into account the scores and they would put him up there as a more conservative and and the way it would you know he would lean\nBut what does it mean um if that doesn't happen\nAnd like I said to list is long and if you go by what judicial common space there's this and they put together Clarence Thomas would be the most conservative\nBrett Kavanaugh if he was in the Supreme Court justice would be second Sam Alito would be third to that and then you go on from there one of the um one of the nominees is Amy\nConey Barrett who also would be an incredibly conservative judge or there's Raymond\nCatholics who's on the list also would be super conservative the most leaning toward the middle would be Thomas Hardiman and they're all they were all on that short list of\nNominees and of course anything can happen and the\nFight over Kavanaugh's intensified there's confusion about the limits of the the FBI investigation and what's redacted and um would he be confirmed if it showed he lied to the set is and again it's a toss up\nI think it's a toss up at this point but I mentioned this the other night if I were crunching my own unofficial numbers [noise] I Would say\nYeah we've got thirty four days of thirty three days until election day we have Ninety One days until the new Congress and looking at this process\nJeff Flake to me I think votes for cabinet and perhaps Collins and Murkowski as well I say it's really sixty percent\nThat he gets confirmed forty that he doesn't so those are better off than some are giving or some are saying they think it's already a done deal but at least the process happened and I think that was the key thing\nThat's happening here you have to have the process because then you can say you did the process we went to the FBI we did that the FBI investigated here see they interviewed here's the conversations here's the witnesses\nAnd all of that\nSo then there's no gearing up to say what would you know we didn't do it we didn't we didn't do the due diligence on this thing to due diligence his [noise]\nTrying to be done now [noise]\nAnd is it long enough for the FBI investigations boy you can't get that information out of the FBI and trust me I Try\nI Do have a friend of a friend\nVery tight connections yet vi and they're not saying much they don't want a leaky ship was put it that way we come back on the flip side were hit you are thought so we go to the mail back here on a [noise]\n[noise] one of the sea of radio\nABC News a big driver on both sides of the political while Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has become a rallying cry I hear the midterm elections ABC News political director Rick orange says both sides are\n... you could see Democrats making the argument particularly\nIn some house races look women deserve to be heard and this is unjust and this is wrong and then I could think you could see the argument made in Trump country maybe some Senate races some big red state Democrats up for re election to say look this is an issue that Republicans have to fight for don't keep him from the bench and really could cut both ways\nABC News political director rich climbing a judge Wednesday well Joe the oldest son of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin whether allegations he hit a woman in my head should lead to jail time if he can stay in a therapeutic program\nAnd then I got this one\nI got this one from Mac who said Kate I knew you were following what happened with a ... on McDonald's killing and I was listening to the police officer testify on Tuesday in his murder trial for the shooting death of McDonald\nAnd he said he acted in self defense what do you think happened here well if I looked into my trial crystal ball I Would tell you it doesn't look good\nSo this happens is time just flies this happened in twenty fourteen and McDonald's was Seventeen and the video is of course awful it I'm set off a huge conversation that was continuing about what's going on um\nYou know ... a what\nThen dyke said his his face had no expression and his eyes were just bugging out of that you have these huge wide eyes staring right through me\nPolice were called to the south side the night of the shooting on reports of suspected breaking into trucks and stealing radios so when they got there they saw McDonald with what they thought it was a knife with a three inch blade\nThe police dashboard cam video of it showed um\nHe was that was forced by court order to may be made public\nShowed that McDonald it look like McDonald's holding the small knife was walking away from the officers toward a chain chain link fence when he was fired on the autopsy revealed that he had a um the teenager had did have a history of mental illness and had some PCP in his bloodstream\nVan Dyke on the stand got emotional and tears were flowing had an hour long testimony and he said McDonnell raises my from inside your shoulder as he approached him and the and the other officers\nAre that you know something that police dash camera video doesn't show so that's the thing the angles of video doesn't show any of that and the police officers saying it's the angle of it the thing that's what it is\nAnd um you know he opened fire within six seconds of getting out of his car\nI'm within one point six seconds because they have all the ballistics and timing of this except ... he was on the ground and and that was that he was gone you know he didn't never got up again so I'm an E. fired at him continuously sixteen shots\nSo what the assistance they've prosecutors thing is you he could have ended that the minute he hit the ground and he didn't and what he kept saying is he still has continued to grasp the knife and he refused to let it go so um\nThat's what that was about and it's it's not looking good I'm for him it's not\nAnd it was tragic event\nI'm terrible for the McDonald's family and it's really ignited a firestorm\nUm in in Chicago but elsewhere to about hey what's going on with this that's why we have this dash cam video and what do you think you see or what is happening and\nI'm just especially to sixteen shots but you know the point taken he hit the ground is on the ground\nAnd that's it but you keep on fire and firing firing so I Do think he's going to do jail time how much what happens I you know that I I'm not sure 'cause of let's see what the rest of the evidence is they're using the prosecutors and\nYou know what you know what that I'm\nAble to mentally tells us I guess\nAll right so here's another one this one is from Joe and Joe's says hey Kate um what did you think of Amazon and raising the minimum wage for their workers to sixteen bucks and hour wow\nOther people are going to have a hard time with the minimum wage employees is that money keeps rolling in that direction Amazon can afford it\nAnd I love how Amazon or Jeff faces the others to follow suit easy for him to say when the money is just continuously blowing in um\nWell we're seeing that we're seeing in others other places depending on the date the worst thing that minimum wage number go\nUp so yeah I mean why do they\nDo that they need a ton of employees so that's part of the reason of raising that number to keep some of those employees\nThat they can have people um\nBecause at that businesses exploded and especially word holiday time they can fill all those orders that prime they turn things around so quickly it's raising\nWe're going to the man cave

S. ing Canada's hand and saying you know we get together\nAt so they probably blinked at the same time was with Mexico's support\nSo is the U. S. M. C. A. a roadmap for resolving the U.S China trade war\nI think it's a more a we get a really important thing out of the way to get to the China trade war and resolving those issues uh as you know there was a lot of uncertainty around this deal because it's more than one trillion and trade\nOr you know the U.S business community the U.S Congress was really really anxious about getting this wrapped up and so I think moving moving forward with this\nAh announcing you know signing the Korea deal announcing a trade deal with Japan he kind of President Trump's kind of gets stuff off his back and saying you know I delivered and now let's move on to the big issue which is China or and so he can he can gain that that support from lawmakers and business right now\nOkay so is it more of a the president clearing the decks so that he can focus on what may be a protracted trade war with China or does this us NCA\nSort of laid the groundwork to show how it can be done best practices if you will for how there may be a path to a trade deal with China\n[noise] it it's more of the ... the first I Would say um I think that it does\nThe ... the ... the first I Would say um I think that it does cleared the decks ah it it does show also that Mexico and Canada there were some provisions and the deal that show you know for example on currency or non market economy status\nUm that they are working together as a as a team I think Gary and Larry Kudlow yesterday also said they had there have been these meetings with the EU and Japan\nOn China and how to um talk about trends at a tech transfer for ... for intellectual property theft all these issues that Trump has been talking about in his us trade representative has been talking about\nUh for over a year now and so there is this work together I don't know if that China a trade deal could come together in any shape or form like the one that we just saw with Canada and Mexico\nBut it does show you know they can actually wrap something up its you know it's taken awhile which is not unheard of in trade negotiations but they are they did conclude something and now\nI Will see where it goes in the U.S Congress\nBut the president said on on Monday when he announced the U. S. M. C. A. but he you know not ready to talk to China suddenly keep you know he he wants to fight more before he actually comes to the table and starts talking\nYeah I think that's probably right I think we've seen\nIn the past couple of months since we started this tariffs tit for tat that they've been engaged in that uh you know it's the talks and the terrorists are two separate tracks and they've been going on for months now\nAnd so that might be some advisors who are telling the president I think it would be good to talk among them Kudlow which we just heard\nUm but there's others who say you know let's not show the endgame here let's you know let's not get to a situation that we have to blink maybe a and so I think the more you can have pushed this maybe even after the midterms because

on double duty I I'm Charlie ... is a Bloomberg Business flash\nThank you Charlie speaking with Bloomberg yesterday national economic council director Larry Kudlow disgust us trade policy toward China [noise] we have\nMade it very clear China's got\nUnfair trade practices [noise]\nBy parents areas high non tariff barriers acceptable\nAnd while the U.S China a trade war could mean higher costs for many us consumers\nMany President Trump's backers are OK with paying a little bit more David mackintosh is president of the conservative group club for growth he joins us now for more on this issue from our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studios in Washington David are the members of a book club for growth okay with paying a little bit more [noise] you know I\nWhat we would like to see is president moved to his goal of zero zero terrorists where not only do consumers benefit and pay a little bit less ... less in some cases a but also you see tremendous economic growth for the United states and Matt\nI'm now I understand China has as Larry Kudlow pointed out significant trade barriers and they've been unwilling to give them up in practice on top of the terror of trade barriers they disrespect and violate\nIntellectual property rights that are tremendously damaging to us export exporters there\nSo the president has a a case to make to try and that they if they want to be regarded as a global power part of the international trading system they have to give up those protectionist ways and frankly ways that don't respect the rights of property\nBut simply moving to higher tariffs regime for the United states is bad for economic growth and and that's what our members belief\nBut David ... doesn't there come a day when the bill comes due for all these terrorists from both sides [noise] oh yeah\nWhat what ends up happening is as terrorists could erected on both sides if they've become a permanent fixture than both the economy's grows less quickly so essentially shrink from what they could be that the practical implication of that is lower wages lower economic return on any investment\nAnd a slower pace of growth for the future\nUh now if there was an argument that's being made and and our members a lot of them tell me they agree with this the president's using these tariffs as a way of forcing China to the table to negotiate and there are real trade barriers there\nAnd that's why I come back to we've agreed we support to zero zero tariffs goal my advice to him and his advisors is get there as soon as you can because the cost of those tariffs are born by American citizens than if if you\nDon't support using tariffs to get the Chinese to change what tools what weapons no\nI got to use a whole range of them um we we I I don't want to say we're it then Tuesday I second supporting using terrorists but we recognize the reality that that's the tool the president has decided to use\nA ... and there's a North American agreement and I'm\nThe big question now for example is\nWe don't need the steel and aluminum tariffs to bring them to the table let's get rid of them in fact if you think about it they cut against the many of the things that the president likes in the\nUs MCA of greater content for us goods if you make it continuously higher to purchase steel and aluminum to put it into a U.S made car\nThat makes them less competitive and will have fewer and fewer jobs\nDoes this us MCA agreement improves the chances of reaching some sort of agreement with China [noise]\nI Do think so I think you've got the United states Canada and Mexico Dow as a United economic block uh probably what the president is thinking let's go to Europe where he also said he was an satisfied but seem to think that there was more opportunity to get to an agreement on trade\nAnd then you can surround China with most of the world's economies and essentially insists ... you've got to drop these trade barriers dropped the of the stuff of intellectual property in order to be a full partner\nAnd just started last minute or will club for growth recommend to Republicans that they approve the new U.S and CIA [noise]\nSo we're still looking at it but based on what I Know I think it would be something that we would support\nOh okay um\n[noise] it's not perfect you know we don't like the the price controls we don't like the content regulations but it provides certainty and it does reduce some trade barriers on dairy going into\nCanada at some for better trade environment for I.

E. on what's happening out\nThere as a class and you're finding most interesting right now I think today all eyes are on bonds I mean what\nWe're using I all I Know or anything of are now and all and throw\nIt all and I mean we're seeing oil higher as well but no I think everyone today is really focused on the bond market because we have ten year treasury yields\nThrough their high from twenty alive and we also see the two year\nAt a two thousand eight high and we also have the thirty year above twenty fourteen level so we are seeing this surge and longer dated bond there be an economic news today big time oh yeah so that really did spur this as well so it helps it overnight things are kind of a baiting\nOverseas in Italy so people are more willing to go into a risky asset so that off of that we already saw treasury yields higher than this morning we get PM I said oh we get I send data I'll get eighty pi I'm employment data and all of them beat expectation I just think the whole story of like all these market folks that we're talking to we respect you all we love all the different\nPerspectives but that idea that maybe the U.S of getting a little bit long in the tooth and then you have bad you know some strong economic news\nContinuing right in the U.S and we are starting to see now it feels like these explanations when we talked to some of those market people like\nMaybe there's this whole other leg that gives us another uh some more room to run in the in the U.S one of the questions will be the sort of convergence divergence question with the rest of the world it feels like you know is the U.S starting to separate and you know you you rightly pointed out Sarah what has been going on with Italy\nAlthough it only seems like sometimes they\nLose though right now I mean I I mean the same thing happened a couple of months ago everyone was talking about Italy and then there was a minor tweak we got ... uh and all of\nA sudden everything's than again everything's good again and it seems like\nToday or kind of seeing the same situation people seemed like they are more calm\nAnd yes everyone keeps talking about us versus the rest of the world is the U.S America First trade going to start paying back and what's interesting I think is that over the past couple of days we have seen it on line debate if you look at the difference between the Dow in small cap so of course small kept working at that last\nNight but with my own personal investments where I met you know big ... versus large cap versus small cap versus mid cap kind of thing like where am I but today it's interesting because we thought this would be an unwinding that might process well you look at the wrestle two thousand today for small cats it's up one point one percent\nWhich is more than ... which is up about sixty basis points so maybe it's just throw a rally off of what we saw the past two days but also maybe that unwinding isn't just completely here to stay\nI Am so going back to the fact that you made surge choose her favorite asset I don't think I don't think like the appropriate\nYour favorite child I mean it's so maybe I wouldn't say it's my favorite but it's the one I'm really keeping an eye on 'em\nRight right and I feel like what was your favorite I said today which is the same way about children it's like well you're my favorite right now but you know states like\nRight here right now you know but it's interesting you look at um I play at my I've got kind of a markets world tour and I'm looking at us at ten five and two and you really do see a significant move in terms of the yield right and what I also find fascinating is that ten year no we always to freak out\nThat if it hit three percent oh my God the world's going to come on down and when it's going to mean here we are comfortably almost a three point to an okay we're doing right and\nThe stock market's rally writes a lot of that since I've been saying that when we took out\nThe three percent threshold a couple of months ago that was really a psychological aspects that we've hit it before All right if we had it again we've done it before we all survived the world that an end\nBut what's also interesting is that if you look at the sector play out today\nYou're really seeing maybe a textbook explanation or play out of what you would expect so financial leading the gains of about one point three percent and then the only three in the ... got staples real estate and utility if we didn't have things settling down on Italy we might not see this trade intentional but I Would\nAt the same time I got you would have the same morning at the economic data was strong enough\nThat people are still very bullish on the U.S economy and now are thinking All right maybe we have more room to run and we're also seeing like if you look at the work function on the maternal terminal we are seeing people price and for the rate hikes so it's almost as if world interest rate profitability we're ... and over December\nThere there yeah people people are probably thinking more and so I mean this summer I think most people think is a done deal on September it was a done deal yet we still have more data look out of course this Friday is jobs days that we'll see what comes from the payrolls apart but most people are factoring in a race and December\nThank

an active shooter situation\nOr we will bring you details as as soon as we have them\nAre getting back to some of our mid term twenty Eighteen coverage here or there was a mid term battle brewing\nA historically Democrat region of Texas where a pro Trump independent candidate is taking on anti Trump congressmen Al Green earlier we spoke with Kesha Rogers about her campaign and about her decision to quit the Democrat Party\nAre accused of Roger thanks so much for joining me\nHello Patrick thank you for having me\nOur ears are currently locked in a battle with a democratic incumbent congressman Al Green and the district of Texas A M for those that may not know that's a that's a fairly big chunk in and around the Houston area in southeastern Texas\nIs predominantly democratic has been for years uh Africans African Americans and Hispanics make up nearly eighty percent of the population there but you've got an interesting story and that you're running on an independent ticket or not them and your campaign could be considered pro\nTrump you know we're just thirty four days out from election day how the campaign going right now\nThe campaign is going very well and as you and I am running against incumbents our grain as a independent and I'm\nRunning as an independent they cut the Democratic party which is represented by people like Al Green leading the resistance movement against the current president of the United states is acting against the decision process and the election process that was made and twenty sixteen which elected\nPresident Trump to put an end to the war policy I think he committed to and to actually address the economic needs in the country and this is not a question of Republicans versus Democrat\nI'm running as an independent because both parties have down to address the real issue at hand in this election which starts with poverty a job at least be addressing the question now hurricane relief\nAnd the key right now is that people like Al Green and congressman green and who represents the impeachment dry against the president based on no constitutional evidence whatsoever\nPose a real threat to the nation in the fact that these people rather see the president removed and the United states get into a nuclear confrontation which is the key issue when you had a president who said he would actually act against the war ongoing war policy\nThis is a threat to those individuals who wants to see the United states get into that type of confrontation\nAnd you've you've fairly pretty much just answered it there you said and this was a quote a that this election as pivotal for the survival of the entire nation so what are you hearing from the people at the ninth district I Know it's one of the poorest districts in the state of Texas what are they talking about the most there right now\nBut when they're talking about the most is job opportunities the unemployment rate but more importantly talking about what's happened when you know here in Texas we had the devastation of Hurricane Harvey and it's not\nJust uncommon too many other states around the country but who has addressing relief whoever addressing the economic recovery program for infrastructure development I that is\nI was talking about make America great again before President Trump even started talking about it because it starts with making sure that our infrastructure sure it's up to a standard we cannot\nAllow for the minus or less in our infrastructure and many lives could have been saying in the infrastructure was not\nAt the lower rate standard that it has been for many decades now we have to rebuild our national infrastructure\nWas ... response to to the hurricane 'em over the last you know come in recovery since hurricane in Houston\nResponse and then to act in the interest of the financial oligarchy financial interest the wall street and not to come up with a real plan of attack on how to\nTry to put the credit and put the federal funding that's needed right into the element of these infrastructure projects\nFunding that's needed right into the element of these infrastructure projects\nOr let me ask you this a future in your mind what's the platform for the current Democrat Party or is there a platform\nWhere Pete your question what does the border in your mind what's the platform for the current Democratic Party is they gear up are of course the twenty team in terms within twenty twenty and who may take on President Trump's what's what what are they going to run on\nTheir platform is resist right now their platform is to run on in teaching comp and as\nNot only myself but others have said that if the in this operation continues with the impeachment\nUm the president right now than they are going to go for a total destruction so we got to put a stop to that and the key is my platform is economic development there ... ... for um right now is to do with this read this movement\nOf switching gears a little bit your House Republicans\nAre no you're running on an independent ticket but House Republicans on the hill right now been fighting back against the Justice Department and the alleged bias against the president hum as you know deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein is accused of saying that he wanted to wear a wire possibly to record the president in secret secret conversations and something familiar to you he\nAlso talked about allegedly a invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment now he denies those accusations what your thoughts on how the conversation shouldn't go between President Trump and Rosenstein should he be fired from the Justice Department\n[noise] I don't know what's gonna happen but I Know one thing is that when the president was elected he was elected by the people and that he had he came in and sort of a maverick is someone who wasn't establishment establishments candidate and so he had opposition from both sides both the Republicans and\nThe Democrat he really ran on the independent ticket\nSo the question is will see what's gonna happen but we have to actually address this from the standpoint of\nDefending the constitution and\nWe will I'm not sure what's going to happen with that but I'll tell you one thing that we have to make sure that the resistance movement people represented by a Al Green than others do not get away with saying just because we don't like the president\nThat we can make up some kind of constitutional fences that are not constitutional to calling for his removal\nAnd I want to get your thoughts on one quick I don't hear a lot of sleep all eyes in the country were glued to television sets as judge Brett Kavanaugh on his accuser of sexual assault Dr Ford testifying on Capitol Hill or have you spoken sewer heard\nFrom people in your district in the ninth district there are on the gravity of ... and what's at stake as senators push for his confirmation vote\nYeah they're disgusted by the whole fiasco and right now the question is it's not a question of Democrat versus Republican what happened to to process what happened to a innocent innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nBut you have people like the ACLU that are coming out even a lawyer Dershowitz Alan Dershowitz has responded to this and he's not he's not a Republican who has spent look what happened to actually defense of the constitution actually having the evidence to prove someone's guilt\nOr they don't have that right now and the people are just sick and tired of these shenanigans and want\nTo actually get the politicians to address the needs of the people once again and what's really are at the forefront of the lives of the population and it's not any of this crap that they're talking about right now\nTalk one easy of radio ...\n\n\nThanks for joining us I'm Jennifer Frank I'm we're following some developing this right now I'd have Torrance County South Carolina\nWhen three

Sanders took the podium things got a little more ... than are fiercely defending the president's comments during a Tuesday night rally in\nMississippi about Dr Ford and her inconsistencies in her testimony their standards are saying that every bit of evidence and facts that scene in this moment support cabinets K let's take a listen\nOnce again a every single word that judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at exam and picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at ah whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them every person that she names ah\nHas come out and said either they didn't call it or it didn't happen or they weren't there every single bit of evidence and facts that we've seen in this moment have supported judge Kavanaugh's case and the president is simply pointing out the facts of no matter and that is what the Senate will have to use to determine whether or not they vote to support him or not\nThere that had a lot to say about the coverage of Bill Clinton when another reporter brought his name out along with the women who have credibly accused the former president\nYou bring up Bill

of that investigation up to the Senate now the centers down it extremely competent today when she called the sexual misconduct allegations against for a quote to organize it smear campaign by Democrat\nNow this language that we're staying out of the White House today suggests that for some reason over the last twenty four hours that's why I have so much more comfortable and backing judge

former Bush official Annette Ryan to discuss take a look amazing\nTo me about all of this they have decided on the left that somehow it is going to be guilty by allegations\nThat somehow this massive burn them all these false allegations somehow proof somebody guilty and I think the bigger issue at stake here that we're really discussing jak and I've told people disabuse yourself all the notion this is just simply about\nConfirming somebody the Supreme Court this is about do we actually the people in the country still believe in the idea of due process rule of law and the fact that we have presumption of innocence until proven guilty what they're talking about on the other side is literally destroying centuries of tradition in this country\nBut also if you think about it a millennia tradition the English common law and which is the burden of proof laws and the cheese or someone is innocent until proven guilty\nDo we really want to live in a world in which your guilty until proven innocent\nFrom a from a political perspectives do\nI Do actually I I think really this whole\nInvestigation supplemental somebody asked me that they well now that we're having a real investigation like rewind we've had six real investigations this is a supplemental\nAnd to the point I Want to make suggestions talk a little before this you know in every FBI background check they always ask does this problem person to have a problem with drinking do they drink to excess that the standard question FBI background check six times six background checks and nobody ever mentioned anything about Brett Kavanaugh has a drinking problem\nAnd the other thing that people don't understand too is when you go to the federal bench when you were nominated that background check is not a normal FBI background check it's even that much more significant I think this whole supplemental investigation really about three Republicans I think it's about Jeff Flake is Lisa Murkowski Susan called actually pretty confident Susan Collins is going to vote for him\nFor about a month away from them is or how does all this play out in the last\nFour weeks sprints to the mid term election\nSo in this little

people that are\nSomewhat apolitical and they realize what a travesty how vicious this is what the implications or if we actually allow this to be validated by not confirming him and so I think it's actually awakening somebody's independence and sort of a political people and saying\nThis is a kind of behavior that you will see become a regular occurrence of these people back in power so I think it's energizing the amazing thing to me jak the left was already ... at them out their base was already fired up I'm ready to go in what they had done is they put the Republican base on steroids with this behavior they've also awake and a lot of independence to say\nI'm not really sure I like this behavior and I'm not sure I Want to give these people the reins of power against\n\nPresident Trump
