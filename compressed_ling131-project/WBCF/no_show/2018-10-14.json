Mississippi College he\nSure it was like you said a latent again there and in this game might be a little bit different school wise if if he has been in there the entire game those first couple of drives that they had the point and you know chances are that they could have put a drive together with his probably making abilities he is a different a definite difference maker and it's up in\nNorth Alabama would get a feel go from Chandler career of the first of two career field goals in this room Christian Lopez drives down the field Chandler career a case of forty six yard field goal or half

lion's point as well once again the chunk dolls go down the field and kick a field goal\nTo make the score thirty one is Seventeen and then as they're getting set to kick off they converted on side kick I think everybody in the stadium off guard and all of a sudden it felt like Mississippi College down to scores was about to get right back in it and the third quarter\nYeah I don't I didn't think

have to do that was a great play by having to get the pressure on the quarterback and then Chris Johnson intercept the past and for all intents and purposes the game was over at that\nPoint and Mississippi College will get the ball back north Alabama could not score off with a turnover in the ... tells moves even a north Alabama territory but penalty after penalty hurt the chunk dolls\nThey

bunch of their cars that are part of the year events every year and I was just a ad ours back in November in San Diego and I got to drive the roles race\nA and they have a system of the guys are rules refuse to tell me who's twist in the wires what they call it a ... system all okay arresting yeah it's really it's really really cool so they they do it I think largely in house but uh you know they've got to be working with with some kind of third party for because they refuse to tell me who are\nThough yeah like I said is doing the technical so it's a it's a pretty sweet system instead of Thirteen hundred watts a amplification Eighteen channels\nUh you know the two big Wolfers I think seven or so two years seven major in speakers and I think what makes this system stand out is that the Rolls Royce is the quietest cabin on the planet I mean I've got a car is so well insulated um\nAnd so uh it's like having a quiet listening room I mean if you're you know if you've got kids screaming or there's phone's ringing are things going on everywhere disturb the experience when you're in the cabinet rolls it is dead silence and another you know a trick that they do they're they have a microphones that are constantly managing ambient sound\nAnd and monitoring exterior noises and so it's like it's like a room corrections system it is every second changing changing the levels and changing the tones and you know it's like a like a Peter ... room correct\nI was just going to say that yeah yeah you know active noise cancellation kind of thing\nBy exactly and so it's really I mean it's just a a beautifully done system uh so so that that that is one that stood out for me as well\n[noise] well you know and it's funny 'cause I well you were chatting I was just looking a little bit on the Web to and I I Can't find anybody ... up to making the Rolls Royce system so\nThey don't talk about it I got to be under any with it yeah\nYeah and you know I I wanted to help your listeners that we did a great slide show on this last year I think you will you help us on that Jeff I'm a if we just kind of want to see some of her what in our opinion of the ten best estimates on the road today you can go to Robert Ford dot com slash car stereo and that breaks down all the systems there from ... to ... there's a lot of great options\nSchool you know and I'm I'm with you with ... I mean me to do to Mr was a good friend of mine and I remember talking to him wants to and he went he went you like to go fast yeah so it's a he was always he was always a cool cat I miss him tremendously you know it was\nBut does some day there's a there's a Porsche on my list with a ... system in it I I had the good luck to spend time with them in Spain a couple of years ago when they when they just put the system in the nine eleven ... and\nYeah it was it was definitely a lot of fun\nAnd I hate now one thing I'm I was going to ask you to before we had a little bit we're going to go to break but I was going to ask you\nI Know you always covered the premium factory systems but you know robs kind of got a reputation for finding pretty you know top of the heap stuff do you guys ever cover anybody that's done you know a real mega after market system do every day I don't\nKnow you know we're we we did have a couple of times over the years I mean my first reaction that after market stuff is sort of math\nI mean I I I can ... you know ... creating your own listening room from scratch as opposed to slapping a bunch of dampening pads and stuff on a room that already exists you really can't be a system that is specifically tailored and built with the car in mind so that when you're putting\nDo the dampening and all that stuff and the side to side panels and stuff like that in the car when you're building it from scratch you really can that I have heard some cool after market systems you know um there's a a shop in LA called Ella Allen ads and they do a pretty good job they use pioneered year um it was actually funny a few years ago I heard their system in a smart car\nAt ... idea that\nI Know it was actually pretty cool for what it was the ... river system for a you know it's based on small wasn't bad but\nYou know to me the after marketing I I think was kind of the nineties bad there are some decent examples but for me\nYou really never going to be the ... names uh you know being our money and that her and some of the top and car today but you know I ...

host Jeff door gay we're talking high end mobile audio this week\nI'm you know even though the major auto manufacturers have stepped up their game they've reached out to the you know the major audio manufacturers to to design premium systems is a factory out on\nThe custom installation businesses still alive and well right here in Portland, Oregon we're lucky to have one of the country's top mobile installers music car northwest you can find their site at music car in W. dot com and you can see our next guest a also Darren pretty cheap car\nAnd what these guys achieved here I mean Darren this is a brand new Porsche turbo 's\nLast last summer and it had the I think the second tier bows audio system and you know car in any carts compromised ... it's a small and that's why I asked and lots of different surfaces so wasn't sure if I kind of\nWork through my childhood and they have a great car stereo wasn't sure if we're going to be worth it but it definitely ended up being a exceeding expectations\nWell and you found to that you know you and I had shattered about this a little bit because I Know you're a real passionate audio file at home and you've got a pretty major system at home and so for you even when we talked to burn Mr system that that wasn't enough you know so how did you find the guys that music or North West\nIn our interests in the late ... actually I've got one I've got a car with a ... and then I Do I Do have a car with the ... and I would say that the masters definitely a step up from the bows and you're on the kind of a sound stage the clarity less that's where my eyes um\nBut uh still wasn't like\nYou know knock your socks off so when I was talking to folks at myself for show which is like my second home I Love those guys over break team they had mentioned reserve car northwest and they the way they talk about I could tell that it's it was like no matter which how high end your car is is that this would be the one place that they would refer\nTheir customers to and I think they even said that some of the other Ninety in spider that you see a car it's taking their sir I'm like if they're good enough to work on that them obviously going to be good enough to work on my ... and so that's how I ended up or down there\nHow long did that take I mean how long did that process take from start to finish\nWell the interesting thing was they've got a really nice approach so they've got a gentleman named Ken who's like a master artist craftsman um architect installer who just works magic where you know fabrication and making things are totally oh yeah\nAnd the folks that forced the sunset Porsche were surprised at how how it looked like a Porsche\nAnd the folks that force or some sort of course there were surprised\nAt how how it looked like a Porsche factory but going in and actually working with with neck\nAround singled out of work where it was like trying to accomplish\nDiner on my home just on the speakers that I've I've had in the sound like I'm ... years ... spoke customized or set of illusions electric choose from and work with versus just ... caught her you know take the Sam ... is at noon it's like this set of speakers\nRight now now Nick when you're working with a client like Darren I mean is this a I mean if I didn't hear you on to his house to listen to a system at home by chance or did he just coming to shop and sit and chat with you guys\nKnow no we haven't had that opportunity yet I'm Still hopeful that you know [noise] but\nUm you know when Darren came in he expressed to me what he had at home and and what are you listening to you and and I could just tell from talking to them about music and about listening that um you know the average everyday sound system wasn't gonna work for this guy I said we have to build something that can really capture the emotion music are\nUm and that's when we started working on designing a man and that's that's what I Do it or not why says I\nWill do and I work with with Tom Miller of the fabric gator on designing a system for deer and it would be sitting for that car and for his must be nice\nOkay so when you when you're Nick when you're doing something like this and again you get a client like Darren or somebody like me I mean do you pretty much before you really get into the meat of this thing to do given kind of a\nKid's meal regular super size option or is it just a infinite leave variable palette of stuff that you've got kind of a you know like we used to say in in the in the old days in the car world you know how fast do you want to spend as it is it kind of like that to or\nYou don't do a certain degree it is we we actually designed a few different tiers of this being silenced systems are we we really need to sit down first when the client and discuss what the goals are once we find that out we get a good plan going\nAnd then I design up maybe three or four different versions of the same system that different price points with a different levels of fabrication and then from there um it's really up for the wind to decide what's going to work best for them\nGot it okay and there and I know you said that you know this really exceeded your expectations I'm you know I mean I I don't know if you want to really disclose what this ended up costing but I'm guessing this is a fair order of magnitude over kicking the six thousand dollar box for the ...\nYeah I mean it's it's a different legs so yeah I was bigger than a bread box for me I was a bread box I don't tell you that I

two hours of popular technology radio where we discuss all things tech this week we're talking car stereo we've just been talking to the guys here in Portland, Oregon at music car northwest I'm that's music car in W.\nDot com check them out you can see some amazing systems that these guys have done we had my other friend Darren on who they did\nAn incredible system in a new Porsche nine eleven twin turbo is\nBut you know that's one of those things that that upgrade probably costs more than some of you even spent on your whole car so that's that's not the working man's car system\nBut you can still do a great job I mean if you haven't bought a new Porsche or Audi or something like that um Bentley with an upgraded factory system you know a few thousand bucks spent judiciously will still make a pretty substantial upgrade in your son ... experience in the car\nOr ... that started out the show with us um he's had a similar experience with these guys but he stayed on a little bit more realistic budget can you know what's your take on this ... you told me you've worked with these guys that he's a car for quite a long time\nHow have you seen the process kind of progress with them I mean what you know they've gotten better obviously at what they do over the last ten Fifteen Years um how's that experience kind of been from the customer perspective\nGreat I've probably been using their services in roughly Fifteen Years and originally started out just upgrading some a factory stereo speakers and they're an amplifier\nAnd the ... the ah starting to get it in the ICU adjustments so you can really find tuned things and it's evolved into recently it's been a at two different systems put into who BMW vehicle that\nThe big advances are the S P tuning a technology and the amplifier so uh what comes from the factory is kind of a from a generic low level amplifier more than they make and even the speakers are kind of a little bit generic\nOh BMW goes to a great wine and reverse cue the factory speakers to make them sound better\nAnd have a big upgrades now are dropping and I'm a man of great an amplifier with like six channels ESP each you tuning and a time alignment I'm correction\nAnd it makes a significant difference the most recent install I have a music card was or was it called the hearing he's sick of all in one drop in ... and that's just a wholesale and replace my they didn't do anything with the speakers\nBut ... percent agree that app as he is ... ... and I think it was like tripled the lot of the factory amplifier hat and it was roughly\nNo it's a a better than factory to even say those cars go through and you are like yeah from Cape and the fall on different things a lot of husband fabrications up to make sure it's bolted downright bullet proof in fact the Toyota recall ya head back\nLike five six years ago they went through and cleaned up some original a fabrication that really was\nA park so they got some fabricated from a speaker mounting play ball or a a a really cleaned up a lot of the details of them are so great solid job I mean it that much better than I Am factory stuff\nBought well then again I think that will be a you know for those in the audience that are considering doing this a good installer will take you to that level will cool man well hey that's all the time we've got for right now Ken thank you for joining

I didn't listen to a lot of music\nSo I've got marker so long ago\nBusiness manager here from radio and he's going to walk us through a little bit of the thought process that went into making that a reality Hi Marco thanks for joining us\nHi Jeff any tanks for the past the introduction or that he is really almost ... I'm going into ... really at the hospital will we do\nAh we are at a a digital ... seeing a uh aspect called money on on the whole deal and Ah yes we stopped in Nineteen Seventy seven elephants pro the war was the more ... be getting the ... or a mosque and seems Natalie ... they'd need you tell in so hauling the but\nAll we want oil spill horrible day at ... ... ... people who are we listening to music as wetlands Web ... than the entire ordeal so has your rightly said ...\n... best place than the entire ordeal so how's your rightly said ... thousand eleven wheat pasta as together we job will end a letter\nTo stop to get the rights beats and music to the hospital and it will stay in the car\nUm since then we will launch seven I'll be from ... I like to remember that the war first read the surround sound sees the main the Rangel that what we launch in ... and then a twelve a again as another war fest into he's still married young so we're very proud of that\nWell it's as if you again if if anybody's ever had a chance to sit in one of these cars or drive one of these cars I mean the the audio experience is is stunning but I'm curious did you find them or did they find do you mean which one of you guys started the dialogue\nWell it's an interesting question but it goes a B it's buck to everybody loved the story the other one approach and the other one and it\nDid any of this have to do\nAs as a BMW owner which has a terrible car audio system in it I Know Bob has uh the last time I was at the factory Bob has a three thirty five I did did knowing what a brainy guide Bob is did did any of that have to do with his deciding hey I should make Meridian work in the car or that just a completely separate thought\n[laughter] that's an interesting so it's a well no we really wanted to give to the ... a little bit of ... people and they spend a lot of time in the car and took all new to some kind of stuck in traffic there has to say that and\nAnd the best thing to do is actually have that and I don't see them and you know they help your soul on some of the ... complaining and bald bald you so you can choose your bail soundtrack and playing as loud as your walls\nAnd the idea was just that the dead yeah laws we have the technical knowledge in ... experience in the car as so we wanted to do that and yet willing to do the\nSame about brain ... joining them for a full month there was a such a close match between our company soul that was hey that was the main reason and\nBald changed any scholar anyway so\nHe was driving a razor over now these days well sometimes\nSometimes no good for him I mean that's a I mean your your traffic there and the u._k. is just as bad as our traffic here I mean I've been I've been stuck on the on the M A few times you know sitting there sitting there sitting there doing nothing wishing I had a range rover to be rocking out and so I get it now\nWhen you started this project I mean how hard was this\nAgain Meridian had a real leg up because you've done so much ESP and all of that um how how hard was it to adapt to what you do to the mobile environment 'cause that's got some unique challenges\nAbsolutely you you saw the lights when you look at it cause you think oh my God this is moving that are out of plastic Seattle last year there and how you're going to make the sounds\nWell the interesting thing is that yes glasses friendly a machine yellow a yes that he's led to the economy moving to speak or maybe they're not seeing the best possible position but there is one main shock so that the U.S some testing for our\nDigital singer possessing couple of billion is well we know that old doors variables they're fixed that never move that never change so when we adopted that what they can all of a gym we knew that the where the east coast time ... that will never changes so we run our mom would run our engineering\nMates and then we came up with a problem that we were suddenly and shoulder but and and happy we ... we did in ... so that's how we came along and and obviously that he's a ... to do and that ain't politician thought\nA great partnership that ... we have the ability to really sit on the table when they're designing as you find the car and walks together ... as I had to work together we ... to make sure that everything is being looked after that he's a ... and\n... to uh read to leave the uniqueness the ... job during your experience\nOkay well I'll tell you what mark a we have to take a quick commercial break we'll be right back I'm your host Jeff ... we're here ... radio talking about car audio we'll\nThat was a month and it's just a different experience obviously the top of the range so between the surround sound system is

C. D. S. L. I. a lot of them around the front Kevin a confirmation which we'll talk about that before we get there I just we just had to lighten it up a little bit so um I felt movie this weekend\nOf all good football\nAs to why didn't really do well on like that 'cause I well yeah then all the cowboys have not been on the cowboys and I and\nYou know they weren't the favorite which means I could have made some decent money and I know they lots of the titans that's okay but you know there was the um\nUh you know the ground over time the cowboys overtime very very cool stuff I'm a Vikings uh I thought play phenomenally a Packers got their butts\nKicked it would kind of thing it was an interesting day but uh this weekend\nI went to the movie 'cause I was in a move in a while and I went and saw a veteran now no if you guys are up to date on the whole marvel movies but them vigilant they're opening weekend and apparently it broke records like hey you know I thought was\nSo they don't appeal to me because of the science behind it so that is I guess the best parasitic alien\nThat needs another host to live and if you remember the old or Spiderman movies in the early two thousand and one of the spider man I think what Spiderman too there was this black\nUm\nIt kind of look duct tape shiny Vulcan eyes rubber type material that was that got into Spiderman and then he meets Spiderman look all sexy and his hair was down and he was dancing to turn a fever and I don't know what that was going on but anyway\nIt is the only the only way it survive is any adults and so they were using the terms parasite and all that as I get it I thought it was really really good but then I\nKinda got mad because of some terminology that the a bad guy use and I can't really say the terminology on there but\nWhere I get really really frustrated is\nAnd I think put women back multiple decades those of us will have been assaulted can't I I you know no one's going to believe us you know after seeing that\nYou know a ridiculous display of um of you know a character assassination you know we want to go after the bad people not the good guys and so when people need to move on but I Do find it very very interesting theme these mob like\nYou know a um attitudes in these these\nYou know well we're going to be a mom we're going to uh you know we're going to I'm a intimidate we're going to I mean this was really really intimidating\nAnd I understand now people are a little freaked out by how if something doesn't go a certain political parties way how it can get and now\nThe and this short of intimidation these intimidation tactics that's not democratic at all that's not what Republican do\nAnd I do find it kind of scary\nI don't remember and you know teach me I don't remember Republicans do you know storming Senate and you know a a character that I mean I for one of the sand I mean Bill Clinton was impeached\nMedicine at the same office nothing really happened to him and that was\nI mean that was actually evidence on a brat [laughter] what right do they have to talk about the draft was in a blue dress and there was like\nBut you know so I don't mind a peaceful protest\nI Love the fact that we have freedom of speech I think people should have a right to complain and gripe\nBut if people are fearing that can't go to work and they asked to hide who they are\nBecause bad things will happen I mean you hear about this and Hollywood I don't know if it was Kelsey grammar are some actors had said I you know I'm getting you know I'm blacklisted from working in ... you know getting movies and things like that because of my political beliefs\nBut that's not cool that's not freedom of speech now let me tell you that I was a little secret what the media access\nIsn't every Buddy Guy we don't put a camera in a Walmart and see people walking going Hi how's it going now oh the fruit looks right today that uh you know those gates you could stand in front of me in line\nThat's not what the media gives you that\nHappening if you go to Walmart you see people kind of friendly just standing in line going you know they don't give them what to me is showing you the fanatics and it's making you feel that you have to choose one side or the other\nThe average person didn't really give a heartening do oh God nominates is free for the average person can't even name all the Supreme Court justice is\n\nThe average person thinks Ruth gator Vince burgers currently asleep right now\nThe average person doesn't care it's these fanatics\nYou know there was talk that some of these people at these at these protests were actually paid\n\nYou know the average person has a life to live we got things to do\nAnd it's the fanatics that get the that they get all the attention you know I tell you have a lot of family in Israel\nFrom the very close to 'em or people who are a Muslim I'm Arab\nArab Israelis there they got you know Muslims and Jews are living together very peacefully and very harmonious in Israel but you don't see that and then\nYou only the Gaza and fighting and you know a rock throwing and and and the you know the people all the extremes\nWhy because it's not very entertaining\nThe people I hang out and party and you know have their you know that in front of the discussion that's not what makes the news\n\nSo the problem is is when you go to work and there's going to be people really heated about this and and and you know come on people really\nWell now the Supreme Court could overturn roe versus Wade the Supreme Court has been talking about overturning roe v Wade at first of all the Supreme Court has been talking about the news has been talking about it well Brett Kavanaugh overturned it I don't know\n\nDon't think that's going to be what's what's a a a constitutional issue I think the constitutional issue is going to be should tax paying dollars go to abortions if you don't feel um if you feel strongly that it's pro life\nWe'll abortions if you don't feel\nUm if you feel strongly that it's pro life that I could see coming up to the Supreme Court sometimes him where those of us who don't want our tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood or abortion say now that the thin don't I don't want our tax dollars go on to that\nThat I could see going up to the Supreme Court I don't I don't see them overturning roe v Wade\nMan boy people have approved throwing with that one [noise] so maybe that's the only way to you know have our tax dollars not going to the things we don't feel we want I don't know\nBut\nWhat happened with the rec having off and you know for it and you know\nA a sweat Nick who I you know it it shows that you have people that will go to extreme ends for politics and\nThat used the admirable when you wouldn't be call to duty and you would you know pick up your arms than you would go to wear your you know sergeant told you that you know and what are your government called you do need that passion\n\nBut to lie to ruin a person's life\nTo ruin and many men's lives that's not something that that I download that a lot of people are downloads\nAnd having taken care of so many people who had been victims of SALT I can't speak for all women who've ever been assaulted but I think a lot of women who have been assaulted thinks the display that we stopped by the Democrat was one of the most insulting ridiculous on backwards things they could have ever done\nFor the movement of trying to limit\nAnd I'm I'm allow you know proper prosecution of sexual assault\n\n... this this was a complete cluster so now they're saying OK well impeach we're going to teach a path that wrote a piece of okay first of all you're not going to have enough senators even if you're winning the midterm elections to go through an impeachment\nProcess that get Kelly plus spend our time in our taxpayer dollars on fixing the country\nThere are so many bigger fish to fry then oh well he lied under oath\nAbout his drinking well so now what do you think the question is going to be you know where did you go to law school how do you interpret the law no it's have you ever smoked a joint\nHave you ever gotten drunk that's what we're going to be interviewing future Supreme Court justices on because they're going to try to catch him in a lie\nThat was ridiculous what they did personally\nAnd they're often I mean do we asked pilots if they've ever gotten drunk with doctors if they've ever gotten drunk before no\n\nLawyers do we ask lawyers and law students get let me leave\nSo that means and nobody's ever going to be able to be a federal judge nobody's going to be able to be a Supreme Court justice so it is going to get it is going to get dirty and we're above that we look weak were really grabbing at straws here we're going to try to teach somebody because he lied\nSaid he drank alcohol [noise] twenty seven seven miles away [noise]\n\n\n\nWater who's the single most important

that it's then it's swung it and um it\nWent off the road and continue to continuing to I'm a turn upon itself\nAnd then hit somebody standards in the ah that ah that that's is that we're in the local area and you know there was a member of the ones that limousine\nThat one on fire was the bachelor\nParty and there was a limousine where I'm the driver couldn't hear people screaming and apparently a fire what started on and on the back of the limousine is all bunch of people died\nYou know I I think we give too much I think we're we're a little too relaxed\nWhen it comes to being in other people's vehicles and when we have is very new sort of culture now where we have no problem hopping into the vehicle with somebody else and when I first started to learn how to drive I was very nervous about being in somebody else's vehicle that because I can be taken somewhere raids are abducted\nBut also because I was like I'm trucks or this person's driving or do they have a heart attack

you're putting your life it to people\nAnd sell this crash kind of unfortunately reminds us that they're not always safe at the hands of a driver that you just don't know or in a vehicle that you just don't know you know I was taught when it first started driving that you just safety checks on your car nobody does that we have the car we beat out\nBut are we check in our tire pressures\nAre we check in the brakes are we doing you know you have to do that in a plane you can't fly your plane unless you do safety check every single time you get into the plane\nThe yet we don't do that with

Maloney of the first lady and I was getting a little bit of criticism and how she says that she believes she's the most bullied person in the world\nNow um I don't think necessarily she thinks she's\nBullied more than you know other people I think Monica Lewinsky was bullied pretty badly I take her husband Donald Trump does bullied all the time there's what naked statues of them out there Hillary his bullied\nUm but I I like that she's\nYou know opening your eyes to how you know these attacks are vicious\nHill and they've attacked her son they've attacked you know anybody in the public office you know one thing that I like I don't know if President Obama had profits up or wasn't McCain or Mitt Romney but somebody had laid some guidelines where family members are off limits\nAnd I don't remember which presidency that was a which presidential election but I had a great family members need to be off limits now unfortunately the media is cruel people are cruel patrols on social media and going to happen people unjust\nI uh their their their their wicked but I'm I'm\nYou know millennia talking about you know being bullied and um she's starting the ah the movement of the ... best\nInitiative which we'll talk about a little bit you know it just kinda sheds light that I think we need to start\nConey that down some of the BS that we're dealing with the same time and then they should have a chance to be best initiative\nUm is something that she's going to be launching as um and she's always been really big on anti bowling since he took office\nShe says she also supports me to move and she had said um it was revealed yesterday that she said you know people are going to come out with these accusations they'd better you know they should have evidence and so you know I Love that we're getting her opinion she's obviously an intelligent woman\nI she's a beautiful woman and I think she's very well spoken I think is an amazing act that and you know trying to be a mom be married to Donald Trump probably isn't easy who rose from real estate mogul to president the I I you know it was never been in politics it's tricky stuff but I\nSee what goes on on social media the how nasty people are I see Yelp reviews I see that there is like the sense of it's okay to be a jerk\nAnd then people look at these anti bowling movements as well right now we're wants to fine America where was the fine our kids yeah it's because we're dealing with one problems\nTrying to treat it with another problem and we're not dealing with the root of it you know in a way when kids get bullied that's how it I'm not saying we want kids to be bullied but when we got bullied in school we realized that there were some things that were not socially acceptable that we could be doing\nLike for example when we went through puberty and we started to illicit some body odor when people start saying oh you think you'd think then you realize oh I guess I better start wearing your it\nNow I Know there's a lot of debate on do we really need to wear ... but you know for some of you guys out there yes you do so when you're bullies you realize oh wait a second I Need to get back on course\nYou know one\nAn allergy to being bullied as you're driving in a lane and then all of a sudden the wheel starts to add those bumps so it's loud it's annoying it's noxious but it tells you to steer back in the late ... some of us want to change lanes and sometimes we have to just burst through\nThose boss\nAnd a lot of us that do that become very very successful sometimes when we first moved to drive or ride a bike we feel we need to during the late and so these little bowling they they they they sometimes help ... you know I met her big sister always yelling at me to quit picking my nose\nWhen I was a kid I thought it was fun to pick up the burgers\nAnd my like quit doing that and she would bully me with it but then I knew not to do it when I had to then later to go to school\nSo and so bad that type of stuff helps mold you and it helps to make you stronger out there on the other hand people are being bullied for things they cannot change like Vern Troyer and his quote unquote dwarf ism that you can't change what what what good is it now for some people they knew that bowling to overcome\nWhen somebody told me I Would never be a doctor I Would never make it in radio I Would never make it here or there I wanted to prove them wrong and so I kind of needed that bowling I don't need somebody saying that my buddies to bake I\nI don't need somebody you know making fun of I don't know a lot of the other stuff that I Do but for the most part these are things that helped shape a mold us\nBut what really bothers me in in today's society it is okay to make fun of people to ridicule people and to be really vicious like that Washington correspondents dinner with that comedian\nWho was ripping on Sarah Sanders look what was the purpose of that but I don't know if she is a ... I don't even know where name that's how I I guess I conduct she is I don't even know what her name is\nBut\nI think I think the public kind of came out going okay that was wrong that was that was ridiculous that was too far\nSo I'm you know\nI don't know what's going to happen later on Internet and social media and entertainment because people like making fun of other people there's there's always been there but at one point it's just not gonna be funny it must be not find it funny anymore that's how we get the ...

adorable and killed we have dogs in our home\nBut you know doctors are now starting to be concerned about the height Jenike activity they believe that dogs can increase the risk of infection by six hundred percent but of course in the article the doctor\nThe risk of infection by six hundred percent but of course in the article ... it's not discussed in here the fact that around fifty percent or less doctors wash their hands enough it's not discussed in here at all the fact that there are germs that are teeming\nOn the doctors tie his or her stethoscope and their little white coat all of that and also in part\nOf these infections so asked that question last week and I want to tell ya I absolutely and sincerely appreciate those listeners who went to my website and weighed in on it and voted

this is evolutionary medicine\nTalking about a ... this out of Switzerland in Australia charting the average family size and disease incidents and we're going to get into this whether you're from a small family or a big family today you're going to learn size matters in families\nAnd may determine your cancer risk\nWe'll talk about that also don't give children dangerous decongestant drugs or medicines\nYet for decades\nDoctors have been recommending that very thing decongestants for children to use for their boogie noses and their congestion\nAnd they're stuffy nose well now there's scientific evidence finally even though there wasn't before in the very profession that brags about all their science\nUh now it's well known that these deacon dressed Justin drugs are highly dangerous even though doctors have been prescribing them for decades what is going on here we'll get into that we'll talk about options on that\nAll right let's get to your phone calls and questions now first stop is Linda she's calling in from St George Utah welcome to the doctor ... show Linda hello\nHi I'm going to for answering my phone call I think we're a hot ... plan for your show her as a ... ... ...\n... ... I don't think so either and I'm I'm hoping I've got the right path because our armed with my daughter off no\n... ... for a combination of all crowd so now\nI've got ... ... ... ... [noise]\nYeah like when I got the ... fire ... fire\nOn it yeah there's only one and you do did exactly what you should do and I'm telling you right now what you've done in learning that is you're going to one you're in a lower your risk of cancer because people who lose their gall bladders have a higher risk of cancer\nOr doctors don't tell you about that before they clip it out of there usually unnecessarily by the way\nMost gall bladders taken out I'm necessarily when you can actually and I know it's water under the bridge and it's in your review Amir but I Wish we would've talked before you had it out and anybody else that you know because we have been able to and many other health professionals have been able to uh stop gall bladder removal by simple ally\nWashing stones and sludge out of the gall bladder with a very simple concoction\nOf a combination of olive oil lemon juice and apple juice it's so simple it's so easy and I have supervised myself personally hundreds of them\nHundreds of them as has other health professional so and but there's you know there's that time when gall bladder surgery can be necessary when they're just it's so far gone that people need to have it out and we're glad to have the modern techniques of a surgical procedures\nAre that are a lot better today than they've ever been to take the gall bladder out but far and away or the gall bladder normally does not need to come out I mean think about it oh these organs are there for a reason they all have a function our creator wanted them there but doctors are kind of like\nThey're kinda like carpenters you know they've got ... a carpenter with a hammer in his his or her hand everything becomes a nail so anybody coming in that complains of right abdominal right up or a Quander abdominal pain\nAnd they can't quite figure it out and tomatoes and they do all these tests and then finally they do the hydro scan or they do it on ... oh yeah it's your gall bladder it's not moving we got to take\nThat out you just don't need it anyway I mean gosh I can make your body better by removing your gall bladder I mean people get talked into that nonsense and people buy it because they believe in the system\nJust like these is what I'm going to be talking about later on in the program the ... the same per fashion\nMeaning while giving decongestant drugs to young children for decades and now we learn how dangerous it is and how many children have died from this\nBut that was the uh you know the standard practice at\nThat time which suddenly just almost like a a page turns you know and now it's not as good for you as we thought that's what we call modern medicine Mazie\nIn any event I think you have it right Linda so go forth with that knowledge and information to know that ah you were meant to obtain it and now you're going to benefit through and buy it\nOkay with that olive oil lemon juice and what was the other\nWell I Do not recommend these things be done in a non supervised manner do not try this at home you need to be in the care of a person who's familiar with the protocol who can monitor and be within a phone call of you in case\nSay something goes wrong which it usually doesn't I I can count on one hand the hundreds of them that I have\nSupervised the only thing that really wrong as somebody gets a little older the stomach but it's it's a highly safe thing especially when you compare it to the anesthesia that is involved with gall bladder surgery the the surgery and solve the complications of it post surgical on on on down the line\nA missile

the connection between the size of your family\nAnd how that may be a determinant of cancer risk\nThis is out of a uh Switzerland and Austria researchers saying there's a connection so think about that are\nYou from a small family or a large family and what is the connection anyway because we know that one out of two women and one out of three men will develop cancer sometime in their lifetime and what if you knew that there was a connection between family size and cancer and you could do something about it to modulate your behavior today in order to reduce your\nRisk we get into that we're also going to be talking about these dangerous children's decongestant drugs or medicines that had been prescribed by doctors for decades and now all of a sudden they're saying they don't work\nCan you even imagine that we've got that coming up on the show today All right we're going to turn our attention now to longevity\nYour longevity\nAnd the topic is fighting the ultimate disease you know what the ultimate diseases guess what's the ultimate disease some people are course now saying cancer heart disease Alzheimer's no it's not that the ultimate disease is aging itself\nMy guest this eh get segment of the show is longevity research expert Rob Martin Love that name who for nearly four decades\nBeing on the leading edge of natural health and medicine\nAs being on the leading edge of natural health and Madison and we welcome Rob back to the show good a deal Rob\nA hot dog to bomb it's great to be on the number one show\nNo thank you wrap her daddy and you know I can always count on you Rob to deliver raking science that impacts quality in length of our lives and today you're going to be reporting on a major breakthrough but I asked you to go on the show today because I get snacks and stacks of information on my desk\nHere I don't know where this is all coming from talking about this word that I mentioned on the intro here to tell them or ... and on of Princeton I I'm going to just you go right through it I Can't you three separate\nArticles sauce tonight overload you don't want to give you have you give and take the opportunity to give us some Asian about all these researchers are doing in the ... area of tell 'em urging and when we finish what I Want to have you tell the audience to tell them or an allergy important that human el\nSure sure yeah you said some interesting articles or one of them is about a losing a father or with boys in this case I'm sure the impacts girls as well and\nAre we know that stress is a very very powerful factor and shortening of telomeres which is really short and your lifespan in your health spam\nAnd in fact Dr Elisabeth like Bernie won the Nobel Prize for research um telomeres in her book she writes the boats a lotta time to stress\nSo it's not surprising if if a young boy loses his father whether the father dies or he leaves a it really is a tragic a deeply emotional experience for a boy that are not only affects them in his youth but the rest of his life\nAnd so it's not surprising that these boys would have shorter telomeres or if it's on a portable\nAnd and it also dramatically shorten the telomeres by and nine years of age in other words up you know let's say the child has a loss of a father at a young age\nYou can shorten that person's life span and you know so it does it goes back to stress okay that's article number will watch the second one that I sent you\nWhile there's another one that the links are the shortening of telomeres with a heart disease\nAnd this is something that's very clear in the literature or all the various aspects of heart disease for example hypertension or blood pressure [noise] um the information or the vascular health\nOr every thing a ... there's a link between ... and the health of your cardiovascular system\nAnd uh it's quite clear quite traumatic factor I'll tell you later you can go to my website I've done videos on various aspects of [noise] of telomeres are not only with heart disease but with all the or a major areas of health concern that we have\nAnd uh so uh when you realize that telomeres off foundational to our basic cellular structure well then you begin to get the picture of how important they are\nAlready in last just a a you know a line or two of uh of statements ... related to lifestyle and how that impacts on longevity\nYeah what's very clear a diet lack of exercise [noise] um [noise] the bad stuff smoking drinking too much or you name it or it's really common sense\nA bad lifestyle habits are going to impact you at the cellular level\nNow conversely a good good lifestyle habits you know keep me up a good body weight I mean that's huge huge a you know that there's not any disease system that we have for condition\nThat's not stellar curiously affected by obesity and that's just goes right down to ourselves or you can in young people if they are they're obese\nOr they're going to have the the cellulose a structure of someone who was sixty or Seventy years old or so lifestyle is very very important and are also keep in mind\nWhen you're at fifty sixty Seventy years or more\nYou've accumulated a lot of cellular damage now it's great to go on a good diet fan and exercise and what have you but we have nutritional things a neutral suitable or technologies now\nWhere you can really help your body reverse that process of of cellular agent\nAnd you you mentioned stress and of course who has a undergone stress or course heart disease related to this a problem with a tele Merce and of course lifestyle so let's get to this Rob ... explained to the audience want to tell them reason why it's important to human health\nOkay uh everyone's heard the word chromosome [noise]\nOn the tips of our chromosomes we have these DNA strands that little caps and we always compare them to the tips are shoelaces and very much like that or as they break down and shortening crack just like those plastic tips on the shoelaces [noise] um [noise]\nIt's the same thing here but instead of the shoelace not working the cell doesn't work and eventually died I mean there's no two ways about it they become ... and that leads to another problem when you have an accumulation of ... cells in your body\nThat puts a tremendous burden cellular burden on you and and and your your your health profile so those those telomeres get shorter as yourselves divide over time when you're young you're twenty five thirty years old [noise] those telomeres along and strong\nAnd your cells replicate clearly\nI Would like to talk about the copy machine right when you put a copy in there by the time you make a copy after copy after copy after copy it doesn't look so good and it's the same thing with your cells so as your cells breakdown in the great forty years old fifty sixty\nNow your cells are not replicating clearly that's where the real problems happen I'm not just on the outside your skin your hair and all of that but yeah the real real health problems that's where they began\nYeah the rooms big bad degenerative stuff we're going to get back into this whole this is really important for you have something to write with them right on because we're going to tell you how to protect what ... talking about those how long are you telling us we all have them in that manner they with us\nAnd we've been looking at and and and I've been attracted to many good ingredients hotel in real science category is the major breakthrough we now can actually get in and reverse the aging of cells\nAnd we can document that and we have documented it not not only in the studies that we we based on a product formulation on but the studies we've done our product itself we have a publish ... human study in a peer reviewed scientific journal showing\nHow middle aged and senior men and women from from forty four to Seventy to an age\nWave and they're telling me as an overall fifty six percent and even the ones that are in the late sixties and seventies we're getting a phenomenal lengthening\nThe idea is we can redo or we can turn around much of the damage that we've accumulated through the decades by late and you'll tell them is that we can do it with televised\nAll right we've just got one minute to break Robin ... when we come back I'm going to ask you what people would feel if they took the uh the televised supplement or an offer that are the people who want to get started on this can happen today\nNo problem [noise]\nAll right let's give the toll free

your claw please call me Clark okay claw how are you today wonderful thank you hope you are I'm doing wonderful thank you for taking my call sure\nSo I have a quick question probably not a simple answer the question [noise] I Know that when you have a bank account you have FDIC insurance and credit unions have their own insurance but in the low cost um investors terms\nI Everytime I call and ask a bit the well we're not going to go bankrupt\n[laughter] that's no answer is it\nNo it's not so what kind of protection is due out this\nOkay so it depends on what you're actually doing like if you own of a series of funds bike you own mutual funds are index funds the value of what you have is controlled by the holdings inside that fine\nSo the value when you invest goes up and down the find itself is not at risk unless the investments in it\nGo to zero so let's say you buy 'em an index fund\nFrom one of the big discounters from vanguard fidelity Schwab someone like that who you know those three are taking so much market share or you end up owning a ATF from one of the you know one of the black rocky ts those are the the big discounters in the market\nThe money that is in a fund is secure in that find there's never been a situation where a money has been stolen and it's just a well and the money's gone\nAnd money in\nA a brokerage does not have as you mentioned FDIC insurance or anything like that so holdings are protected by what's called S. I. P. C. did anybody mentioned SSI PC to you\nI've seen it at the bottom of the page when you're looking at the site\nAnd S. I. P. C. is a vastly inferior protection for you than what you have added a credit union through in the u._s._a. or at a bank through FDIC\nSo aside PC is a privatize version of protection and the most contentious cases have involved where a brokerage has been crooked\nAnd S. I. P. C. has not been there to protect people and the event of a brokerage going insolvent CSI PC takes care of people but if it's involved fraud or something like that they don't\nPut your money how is it held is it in mutual funds or a ...\n... mostly most of it as a mutual funds indexes in and I are a little bit of it is in money market now with money ... be different than the funds\nYes so money market works a little differently and last decade during the ah banking scandals there were I think to money market funds they couldn't pay out\nPeople's accounts and they went at least temporarily insolvent and it was a terrible problem very upsetting to people\nAnd a money market situation that brokerage houses offered generally two options you can either have the money and a ... earning FDIC insured\nA account or you can have it in a money market account where the interest changes each day\nAnd I have my money and money market I'm not\nParticularly worried because even the last decade when we had this this series a banking scandals\nNo one of any and there was no significant or meaningful loss for anybody from any of the money markets even the ones that temporarily went insolvent ultimately paid people the money they owed them almost a hundred percent\nWonderful thank you very much for answering the question\nThe big risk always is with a smaller brokerage that may be crooked and that's when your money is at greatest risk if that gives you any comfort\nBut does thank you very much for best to you last year thank you Bye bye\nBye Robert's with us on the Clark Howard shown Robert here with us to talk about your car via experience yet another disruptor I was talking just moments ago about the mattresses and razors [noise] who knows how many other\nBusinesses are going to be disrupted Carmona\nYou buy a car sight unseen for you call me because you were trying to do what with car vodka [laughter]\nI was trying to sell and on my car or on my cars\nAnd the process freaked out\nAnd you wanted to make sure you weren't gonna get ripped off and you called me and we talked through the process did it turn out that you really were dealing with Karl von ... and that everything was on the up and up or what ultimately happened 'cause you're going to educate me right now\n... surprisingly well really well I I ...

I'm Carol master along the case and Kelly welcome to the weekend edition of Bloomberg Businessweek over the next couple of hours we're going to bring you knew this week inside to the magazine\nAnd a lot more and it speaks broadcast it sooner than you think edition so we're going to be focusing on the future of money some fascinating stories there plus investors are testing strategy to take advantage of climate change or get into that as well a couple of major themes this week feature money climate change but first [noise]\nSide legalize\nIt that's what is happening to marijuana throughout North America and the United states it's happening really out of state by state basis\nAnd then on Wednesday we're going to see recreational ... becoming legalized federally in Canada it's really the first G twenty nation to do this now in the magazine this week there's a section focusing on the business of marijuana\nAnd the financial invasion of pot to the impact on the medical marijuana industry also the beverage industry watching it very closely\nSylvia killings worth edited the section she joined us now so so that first of all I'm ... the section is sweet definitely this has been a year it says like the candidate is movement has gone from a fringe investment is something much more serious what went into the thinking of how you guys want it to cover it\nSo it's kind of becoming mainstream and the main\nUh sort of its centerpiece around that says that Canada is coming online as a fully legal recreational manic medical\nA country on October Seventeen and that's the only only the second country has completely legal marijuana so we kind of given at our North American neighbors want us to look at what does it look like for an entire country to come on line all at once and it's a little bit of a petri dish for the United\nStates by another destroy that takes a look at kind of what specifically is going on in Canada that's part of the coverage the first story to you guys really look into you know how do you kind of put tighten your portfolio and even in\nIs that there's still so much that has to be dead mhm yes there's a lot has to happen it's still very complicated\nUm to trade between the U.S and Canada because there are a lot of regulations and rules about if they're going to list on a certain stock exchange you can't have us holdings and so\nFor example if you want to less than a Toronto stock exchange you can't have any us kind of holding so many people are kind of looking over to the Canadian stock exchanges has slightly different regulations and rules\nUm another round block is getting banks to invest and finance that's a huge one right here and just generally that when the ... you know this has got banks kind of scared to get in yeah there's reputation\nWell I Love how you write in your story credit you talk about them a fear of missing out for the beverage companies and you do talk about Coca Cola I think they kind of shocked the world when they said we're interested in this and we're pursuing it yeah um and it really kind of set off a storm and contract to pepsico right that we're not so interested\nYeah pretty interesting um divergence their mother to longtime rival so I think you're right Coca Cola Coca Cola is probably the best known brand and the entire world right arguably you know it's a company from Atlanta they're not considered sort of a risky or you know cutting edge company necessarily but they came out and said\nYes we are looking at CBD for wellness drinks worldwide so they made a very fine point they said\nWe're not looking at the age see this is not going to be coke to get you high right but yes we are interested in CBD as it might pertain to wellness strength so that sports drinks maybe that strengths targeted at the yoga crowd [laughter] but you know coke was this interest definitely sort of just a heightened be interested in this space\nTasted I Know you have great writing and ... has got riding but you write in your story from the black market to the stock market announced pair appears to be on its way to the supermarket I mean we are rapidly moving in that direction where this is going to be a consumer ...\nGood potentially or is it\nYou know a lot of people think it is so can accord the bank of and Canada saying it could be six hundred million dollar industry in the U.S by twenty twenty two so kind of established market\nSo that's a big yeah the campus beverage market that's right so that's a big number and you're talking about you know the fear of missing out comes from\nCoke and Pepsi are struggling to sell what they do it just sugary soda\nSo sugar has become a health Boogie Man people want to cut back on sugar and if you listen to people talk about candidates beverages zero calorie comes up within the first five seconds he's are going to be zero calorie drinks it's gonna be water infused with CBD or THC so\nThere's really a feeling here that for coke and Pepsi this was going to be an opportunity to believe that can't pass up after missing out on some pretty big consumer trends over the years obviously Pepsi said no you know how to CFO came out and said we're not interested in Canada as a stock went down\nSo that really to me he said something kind of about where we are where you have coke saying we're interested they're seen as not benefit Pepsi says no one stopped falls that's obviously investors think that this is something these companies are participating\nSo quite as you look across the landscape me the other big deal with constellation canopy making that invests in five billion dollars I Believe is this a build or a by play generally is there any sense of how the beverage companies will move ahead here\nSo I think in the initial days it's gonna be a by play just in the sense of you know there are still regulatory issues here right it's easy to kind of\nCovered this industry or read about it and think that um this is fine everywhere but look the federal government still considers marijuana in illegal drugs schedule one you know the worst of the worst with no medical benefits so the border still a big deal you know the border it's illegal in the U.S [noise] so for a company like Pepsi or coke\nYou know they don't have access to the banking system if they're dealing with marijuana you know the big banks have stayed away from it so\nCandidate has become a safe place to sort of ... it just sort of experiments with it so that's why you saw a constellation do it that way basically take a big steak in a Canadian company\nAnd I think the action you are going to see over the next year will be north of the border in Canada and I think primarily by these big companies partnering with existing Canadian companies that you know have access to the plant which they need and have some expertise kind of in cannabis and then the big beverage guys can bring sort of the expertise and consumer branding and all that\nSo beyond the big beverage guys you talked to lots of people around the industry does everybody essentially have marijuana strategy at this point or they or if they don't they decided actively not to like the marijuana play\nRight I mean I think you know as far as packaged food and beverage I think that all of those guys have to be looking at it you know again we're coming in an atmosphere where the food and beverage companies the big ones have lost billions of dollars in revenue over the last ten years\nAnd it's gotten worse here the last three to five years because they've been slow on consumer trends and they're considered out of step with where the consumer is and just you know lacking for growth so here this is you know kids seeing CBD you're kind of fuzzy new ingredients you know this is a trendy thing that people want to know about and it appeals to women that appeals to men\nSo I I think that these companies you know some of them are reluctant to talk about and again there's a reputational risk for some of these companies are inherently conservative but I'd be surprised if any big company was not sort of looking at this base trying to figure out how to play it\nCan we looked at Colorado since they've had um legalized recreational marijuana wanna first couple of years to get an idea of the growth that we might see and I can just average market\nYeah I mean the bottom line is that the numbers are up you know when we talk this company flow ... which can attract marijuana sales data in a certain number of Colorado stores and sales nearly doubled from twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen are up another Eighteen percent the first half of this year so\nThat speaking to the demand for these drinks in Colorado which has the most mature market California a little bit farther behind obviously much bigger in California but writers clearly interest here in these beverages and these companies see this data and know that\n... what does it mean for the ... the constellation brand says that are looking at this is this a new marketplace for them or I think you're right and your story about the substitution if they do do I swat that my wine or a candidate string\nI Do think that's a concern for the alcohol companies they think that on friday night someone's going to come home from work and maybe it's you know maybe it's a joint or maybe it's an edible instead of that six pack instead of that block a couple of ...\nMaybe it's you know maybe it's a joint or maybe it's an edible instead of that six pack instead of that vodka a couple of drinks or whatever the soda guys I think they're looking at a new category of beverages wellness beverages for alcohol I Do think they're worried about people swapping out and I do you do
