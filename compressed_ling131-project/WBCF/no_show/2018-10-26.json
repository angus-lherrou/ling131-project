the outlook for the Republican Party in the Senate I'm looking at Texas Arizona Nevada Michigan Missouri\nAll of a sudden it tumbles out that the Republicans are in command of this do you believe that

[noise]\nI'm joined by my colleague and friend Malcolm home line conference presidents major American Jewish organizations because November fourth approach\nNovember fourth is not the election November fourth is the day I Believe unless Malcolm corrects me that the sanctions from ... from the United states will visit\nThe Islamic republic of Iran\nThese sanctions are severe enough so that we're concerned with the whole region and the economy of the whole region because we're not certain how Iran can proceed its economy its trade with the world its oil sales to the world we're not certain however\nIn addition to the November for sanctions we must talk about the driver for the sanctions which is the suspect nuclear weapons program so we go immediately to our colleague Eli hunting and\nHe's a scene he ... he's a senior advisor on science and nonproliferation at the foundation for the defense of democracies as well as a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of governments bell for Center for science and international affairs Ali a very good evening to you I'm Glad you're back because his November fourth and the whole point of the sanctions\nIs to reveal or at least deter\nThe uranium of the Iranian nuclear weapons program I go to the site Parchin I Believe that the site where the prime minister of Israel identified an archive of the work that Iran has done over the years and can start again when an F\nIs that correct is Parchin the place that the inspectors need to look or at least secure for runs plans good evening to\n... go to the Internet and so having yes it's a place which I Believe he says you might recall that the ...\nDo without seeing at the beginning of the implementation of so called show and then all that and yeah yeah yeah after so many that are related issues and they had the very least access so they sucked\nAnd they say that you might be able to do with a normal routine these facts and so they need to read it aside\nUs questions from the Iran that got eaten enough samples and dive into detail for that book and what really happened there in two thousand two two thousand and three on to fool tosses seven\n... in your report um would you review anything about the undeclared nuclear activities in the ... military base and\nIs what you're saying that the the mistake made by not insisting during the Obama administration negotiations on including the resolution of Parchin as a precondition for the deal that we are now paying the price for it\nChin as a precondition for the deal that we are now paying the price for it\n... it looks like that and we have not really going to find out the whole broke from the whole North Korea much fro come over here on outlawed it was how far it's when and most

conference presidents Iran sanctions Iran sanctions November fourth of ever force what does it mean why is everybody looks decided why the concert All right we welcome Catherine ... power\nThe limits on cats family fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy former treasury official K. to very good evening to Malcolm in I've been arguing\nYou know because we are getting in your presence between break in the break about what we're going to start with I Want to start with a swift Malcolm go right ahead All right but but doing this ... swift and why is it part of this\nUh sanctions on November fourth that everybody is pointing to good evening to\nA pleasure to be with you I'm so swift it a financial message um it is I like to kind of explained that it it's like an email\nUm it just carries a message from one thing to another state the predominant way in which banks send financial messages\nAnd financial messaging services are one of the activities that provision of financial message on therapist who are on it is one of the activities that will become sanctioned up all at the end of this wind down period that we're in right now it ends on November fourth so as a November said that he thinks shovel activity [noise]\nSo ... are there alternatives to turn into Venus outside of the switch swift which us can use to force the zero important policy done\nSo so I should take a step back and look at the last round of sanctions I'm under the last round of sanctions west um did cut off a number of Iranian banks and so that's what the U. S. is seeking to see again um at least in part\nA what we saw then why is that there are other ways to send messages\nAnd in fact a without the underlying relationships between banks that messaging services don't mean very much so if you think of the email analogy\nI could send you an email um but if you don't know me or don't want to have a relationship with me or not necessarily going to respond to it so it's not the way in which ... it's just the way in which messages there that um if you look at when the sanctions relief was put in place is another good way to consider it\nSo a lot of people thought that when Iran was given access to get into this with platform that it would be like turning on a switch and all of a sudden Iranian banks that he reconnected to the international financial system but of course that we didn't see that\nA lot of things were were wary to reconnect with Iran or for a variety of reasons that were uh in some way it's related to sanctions overhang but it related to all kinds of other concerns and dealing dealing with Iran\nAnd so does underlying relationships didn't necessarily material at\nWhat we've seen since the U.S withdrawal from the uh the Iran deal\nAnd they materialize what we've seen since the U.S withdrawal from the uh the Iran deal and de ... even though it's banks that did re engage most of them have had since withdrawn those relationships are so it doesn't it doesn't necessarily matter as much it's not a silver bullet\nUm if the banks won't uh aren't willing to do that the business anyway\nAnd I think that that actually the announcement that this special purpose vehicle that the Europeans have have said they're going to put in place um to try to maintain a financial linkage with Iran when the sanctions that reimpose is kind of an indirect indication and acknowledgement\nUm that those banks with or without swift aren't going to do it and they're trying to find alternative even though it's essentially a barter system that they're proposing\nAnd not likely be very effective given the past records but I wanted to ask you a two things one we know that Iran\nWill look for ways to evade any kind of restrictions so we see it now on the world where they're they're trying to disable the tracking system owned a sweet so you don't see the destinations volumes and it wasn't swift also means for us to track\nThe money flowing unit in Iran so those who raised concern that we're going to lose that information you know valuable information for tracking the Iranians is the is there an alternative means to do so\nSo uh first I think that that some of the the the conversation around living access to to to tracking Iranian activity it's it's a little bit of a a a Garbo and there's there's two things that are apples and oranges there is a program called the terrified and tracking um\nI'm Sorry to hear that the terrified of tracking program that uh that the Treasury Department and ministers and has since uh shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from sweater subpoena that can be searched\nTo look for terrorist financing activity um and that's that's a separate kind of program ah this this with and that continued when a Iran was taken off of swift previously under the previous round that function\nUm so I think that those are two issues that are getting max but but on the issue of the rainy and ... of course first of all there's other ways that they can send these messages and that they did last time whether it's by facts or email or any way just to to signal that they want to move funds from here to their\nBanks that are willing to take the sanctions risk of dealing with Iran um you know after November tests are probably going to do so regardless of whether or not if it's on the Spanish program just says you know go ahead\nDon't know I I I don't want us to run out of time and we did not ask about the efficacy of the sanctions so far\n... she was she did address that in the in your opening about the first round I mean we we tried to keep track of the companies that have pulled out we've tried to report because people don't know would you judge the effort to see the first round of sanctions as successful and really impacting the target you saw it\nI think that's a really important question and we as we approach November fifth because I've I think one of the things to remember is that there were these two Ninety Days in a hundred and eighty day wind down period\nThat what that meant is that businesses at that period to to pick up any business that had been allowed or that they were doing and that a lot of of firms acted very quickly after the announcement and and ... and so I'm In terms of of assessing the ethic of yet but I think you've already seen a lot of pressure\nUm that that's going to be brought to bear through all the first\nKnow the sanctions that went back and place um August ... well before then just that you're going you know we've probably seen a lot of the impact\nUm that we're going to see a as of November fifth\nAh because this activity should have a already stopped and in fact because this idea of sanctions snap back within the words are written into the Jaycee Pierre way perhaps not for a scene and that's the way up but most terms that that that would have ... gauge would have had plans on the

well expectations that fifty six point six million dollars or twenty nine percent [noise] at\nThe same time last year the operating income a three point seven million dollars and the third quarter exceeded this strange to Amazon on guidance on fourth quarter guidance about how hard the company is dying between\nTen and twenty percent growth joining us out and it's got there and make the jump shot a market analyst company that tracks up to five billion cliques that day over a hundred million devices to deliver insights into online consumer behavior although it is kind of a wall or something like a talented conference Amazon for us as well so you're kind of what happened here\nSo if you look at the revenue miss a especially in the guidance side of things that was a big number of the spending part and we will not worried about much because we expected sending pressure across the board the wage hike a issue was one of the uncertainties\nAre from the business perspective the two areas where we see the weakness in terms of expectation one this whole foods or the physical stores you know the signals of sequential decline and oh they were laughing all full quarter a whole foods acquisition fourth quarter so basically\nAnd ah they were laughing or full quarter of whole foods acquisition fourth quarter so basically that's that's one area where maybe the physical a push is not growing as fast as a as we expected into secondaries international growth in general\nA slowdown materially\nThey mentioned there was a change in the holiday season for India that\nSort of pushed out some sales but look for it hadn't been you know that becomes Hillary as well so if you take those two things out of the equation and look at like eight Lewis the advertising division they didn't they didn't find I mean do some slight girl the growth rate the decline in terms of like what they did last couple of quarters\nFor the last numbers but based on what we're seeing so far I think these are the two areas where people are\nAgainst him find not acceptable for me out ... ... what do you make of that\nBut I think we're still seeing really strong growth I don't I don't think that has anything to be worried about in areas like private label products which Amazon is\nPlacing a big focus on we saw that grow twenty two percent your rear and especially in some of those non commodity products or Amazon basic says they're ... they're that sells cell phone chargers and batteries and so far we saw sixty percent growth in non commodity Amazon private label products\nWe also saw huge growth in in advertising revenue I mean up to\nTen percent of all the products are just on Amazon now come from a sponsor search and that's up from ... percent in January two thousand Seventeen so there's huge room for growth\nTalk about that because the alphabet and Facebook have dominated the digital ad market Amazon gift and they're cutting down point\nTo catch up in ... ill ill here and what I Would add to say about that and and the next segment you know\nCanada and really get there\nSo retail is a big segments for Google it the biggest political for them on from advertising perspective and now we're seeing large O'Brien's warming up to Amazon a lot more given them disclose hundred million plus by members looks too big to ignore so now what happened to seal shift the dollar ship with it\nOn Amazon is targeting two buckets right and one is the the search bucket that Google has the other was a ... promotions bucket so they do get to sort of like benefits from the from that ship that's happening from big O'Brien's and they can\nDeliver showed the are why because you you are advertising the product and you know exactly you know how much the sales were and things like that so the targeting becomes much better so that becomes an issue so Google needs to sort of like\nThe opposite direction that we're here are the result saw their partnerships with commerce so it ... dot com investments and read things like Google should be more aggressive and e commerce\nAnd of course take the ... a lot more aggressively when I was on his encroaching on them are from an advertising I mean\nWe know that costs are going to go up and down as increasing wages\nAnd the company to opening each kid to they're going to be creating\nA thousand new jobs I mean how ... how are the costs going to impact coming quarters if we're in a state of fine\nI think they still have a ton of room to to to grow in all set those costs I mean again to to piggyback off of what you were saying over fifty percent of the product searches on line now occur on Amazon rather than Google like the actual e commerce product searches which is the stuff that people want to pay for and in concert search collects\nSo I think is they invest in those kinds of tools and costs go up they're going to see a much higher spike in the in the return that they got to talk\nHappening globally I mean we know that there is a huge tear for happening in India in particular but also other parts of the world\nYeah so that's one on certainty that we're still you have to figure out and all of us on the call hopefully we get some guidance on that\nIs the tariffs on certain ... causing some guidance to go down and write because there's a direct impact from across the board of trade perspective it's a smaller portion of ... but there's an indirect impact from margins of third party sellers and what it means for buddies sales growth and things like that\nSo blue hopefully get more details on that but that's definitely a concern\nThe Amazon earnings how to start at twenty five minutes from now there and we want to hear\nI Want to hear how the investments that they're making their advertising platform is are paying off international growth cause I completely agree I think there's a lot of room there's a lot of room for opportunity there there's also a lot of risk if they don't execute properly and I'd love to hear more about how they're\nInteracting with the rest of the ecosystem I think those retailers and brands are probably very reticent about what's happening right now in very nervous and I think they really need to figure out how to create a little bit more of an equilibrium like Google has done a ... in that market that\nGot a holiday season coming up I increased postal away\nHow are the next few weeks or granted on every year maybe it here in particular\nYes especially given the guy didn't snow on the street is going to expect more than what they're what they're guiding code given the holiday season demand especially with so many more prime members have right now we're supposed to last year\nI think it was down to his like are they able to manage the cost in terms of getting the capacity to deliver these products and send them on a sort of meet those numbers because we did see\nThat created an issue back and forth to Fifteen and they remember I was always like it used to talk about profits as profits will have been slow people flowing and now the guidance of suggesting that might be some because reach hikes postal rates things you're talking about and basically skinny logistics to support him out\nThere and we had when our\nRegulatory\nI think there's probably regulatory had wins a especially internationally um I think there's some brand and relationship headwinds right how are they going to a new in these categories where they own any plus percent of the online market share\nBut there was going to be other competitors that come up and there's going to be brands they just don't want to work with local team is so I think that they're going to have a lot of those kind of had when you think\nThese firing ah with with President Trump cafe owner of the Washington Post you know could that would be a real business risks for Amazon\nGift so it's basically a compliance costs from a data perspective to sort of like what we've seen with Facebook and Google ah with

look at the populism phenomenon and think it starts with Donald Trump ended the most assuredly does not\nWe're going to take a look at just the history there in what Chris was put together every man a king is short colorful history of American populace and it's published by a twelve and respect you for joining us tonight\nWell certainly my pleasure thank you for having me\nAbsolutely let's start with just where you would start that is to say at what point did you say we had a political leader who could be defined as a populist well\nThink about it this way in American history even before there was a country or even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there\nUh even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there were people who felt perfectly convinced absolutely sure that there were elites who were crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe wealthy planners in Virginia\nWho were conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism and the American tradition but we're talking about is grievance we're talking about a subset of the population\nThat feels like they have been cheated or that they have been wrong or that their interests are being worked against often and then the various way a B the bankers the elites me they whomever a and\nPopulism ... when we have outbursts when we have a ... a popular sentiment in the United states it's when that constituents he gets to be large enough\nSo you know we all read the federalist papers that everybody knows Alexander Hamilton because of the play and all of that stuff but while they were doing that uh there were anti federalist too there were people who said you guys are cooking the books against us and we don't like it\nUm so this is this has ever been with us but certainly the first time you get a leader who breaks through that's when you get Andrew Jackson and his three presidential elections and a real revolution\n[noise] now it would be safe to say I believe that we probably therefore had populace impulses\nBefore necessarily the system allow them to be heard very much because of course from the beginning well the electric started out with that in the beginning electric consisted of a of a white guys with a lot of property\nAnd there was a

while to man he was a wild thing and uh what's interesting is he had he had\nRun for the United States Senate a as a staunch basically to re consolidate power\nIn Louisiana and his intention was that he would try to hold the governorship in the Senate seat at the same time he wanted the legislature he was a lame duck and the legislature was being\nA was starting to a pale uh at the demands of the king fish the emperor of Louisiana all of the things that he told them to do there was they were starting to have some opinions and he did not like that\nShow he ran he figured if he ran statewide for that Senate seat he could show his great power\nAnd he did but then he found that he couldn't do both so he wins but doesn't go sir points in Nineteen thirty two but he doesn't go serve until eventually constitutional crisis he uh has called out the state National Guard\nOr to prevent the lieutenant governor from take the oath of office he said but eventually he finds a a more accommodating Lieutenant General uh our our lieutenant governor who will be applying to a vessel for the will of the king fish and then he figures he has to go to Washington\nSo he gets here and he finds out\nHe can whip these people just as easily as he whipped him down in Baton Rouge\nAnd that the reporters here are just like the reporters they're desperate for good copy desperate for wild stories he finds out that the same levers of power that work there work here and he went right to work in in the course of very little time he found himself eight absolute sensation a national political figure and people couldn't get enough of it\nHere is a floor speech just one excerpt from Huey Long talking to his fellow senators a mob is coming here and six months to hang the other Ninety five you damn scoundrels I'm undecided whether the stick here with you or go out and lead them\n[laughter] well okay we'll put you down as undecided voters over ... undecided [laughter]\nNow that are there came a time when he became a something of a sensation about possibly challenging Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency what happened\nThe sensation about possibly challenging Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency what happened to\nAt this point of uh of him grasping for the ultimate political power\nWill think about the context in Nineteen thirty six I'm there were a lot of people who thought that the American system of government probably that the smaller Republicanism wasn't gonna work\nUm that what was happening in Europe was maybe a better solution um the depression had proven intractable\nAnd you have national social national socialism\nIn Germany or you have fascism in Italy and Spain\nYou have a strong argument being made here including them with a bunch of American adherence people like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh uh Joe Kennedy and others who said hey\nYou know maybe we ought to pay attention to this maybe this is a more modern scientific way to approach things uh and the moment we we take for granted\nOr our institutions are weak now relative to how they were say fifty years ago but we it's hard for us to grasp you know on the day that Pearl Harbor was bombed the American Nazi Party cling two hundred thousand members are a lot of the things and norms that we take for granted today in the pit of the great depression or not\nThat was not that was not everybody was an agreement with the American system was the best and the wrong\nYou know this very vivid apostle vis a vis a vis wild man who had an amazing gift for oratory and amazing gift for facts and figures could talk his way out of anything a and had developed because\nThe poor people in America show many poor people in America felt that he was one of them and understood their plight\nUm it it was happening um whether or not he was really getting challenged Roosevelt thirty six I don't know um he had a being Huey Long he had lied about it and he had talked about it and several different ways depending on who he was talking to 'em but whether or not he was going to challenge the threat that he could topple Huey Long and when\nAnd when and went on a platform or that he can topple Roosevelt and when and do so on a platform to basically called for repealing the American system that it was time that we had something more like a dictator who had the power to deal with entrenched interests who where he said we're harming the common people\n[noise] how did he die [laughter] well I I Would say I would say absolutely um he was killed so a on a white as he was sort of reaching the peak or in August of thirty five is his big\nIf he if he is swinging for the fences a but then he has to go back to Louisiana\nTo finish up some work you've got to go back into the legislature what to do tell his toe these what to do and straighten some things out and he's gotten one judge\nWho is a real problem for him or in this judge keep striking down the obviously unconstitutional actions that he is trying to take 'em and so he is going to root this judge out\nBy any means necessary so he has a ruined the judge every way he can't he's got all of the judges relatives fired who worked as teachers or he is and has finally passed what's actually has a beloved painter he has passed a bill that is going to pry this judge out this is corruption extraordinary\nA and that judges son in law walked into the very state house that Huey Long could build as a monument to himself\nAnd shot him dead right there and in the most fitting turn long might

six six five votes jumbo played six six five oh five or six to six I can remember the last roller coaster I was all this was at a at Opry land as I recall and they have a a thing that the twist you through I guess a like a three hundred and sixty degree\nA thing is kind of like a model rail and I'm sure that our gifts defeat tribute go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second do you do you do what ride that was\nYes I Do actually is one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew which is just gave you exactly on that that was a ... I think it was called the ... or something along those lines\nAnd was very short it only had that one little uh the one that one little area but yes I'm very familiar with it and uh uh in today's standards it probably like a kiddie ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course all the land was a great place to that to put an amusement park right next to\nThe ... hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was ah how should I put an exhilarating\nAh I most viewed it definitely woke me up but I remember that that we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers over there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a little bit tired at this point and and uh it woke me up Yes sir\nLived there'll be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did\nWas actually called the ... virus a fiery\nOut oh all that well anyway I'll put it this way it didn't lead me say this was awful just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as as a gift to the park I got to ride for free okay that's fine but I paid to do it again ... no not really but then again of course that's a that's just me what are some of the places out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\n... drove you go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually uh uh a in I'm In law actually have started a I guess it was around the camera late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that comes in light of course the universal studios\nAll which is their hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much a American horror story the walking dead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want\nThe the Walking Dead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse and so the place where are you going to have to be\nTotally scared and and now you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World and Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and off for the kids and of course got the ... to you a Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy\nHollow wishes or over the over ... ah some of the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations have the right fast\nWhich is your Claire classic scare zones all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the sewer and it's just so that the sewer souls and the witches layer and places like that um\nAnd of course the the point has got hollow our weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin ah fast that that goes on there are ... zombie high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really are they really get into this big time uh I mean even the chain stores\nSound extremely we'll plus David changed the names of the rides sometimes\nUh for example over its heroines or which is a Carol wins in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street\nUh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows and zombies and and of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novels a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this or and or they're just a you know the rise are still open the weather is fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places whether it's universal studios knots berry farm which is in a that's and that's ... ... basically Anaheim all we mentioned to the fight fast and the phantom lights over Kenny would a house screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens are and of course heroines in Mickey's not so scary Halloween all\nThese places that we've mentioned plus others\nUm during the day you know during the day is it really isn't like that\nOr it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and there's ... awake and that's pretty much uh most of these places go if you you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zones their actual zones\nWhere you'll you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the maze is and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zone\nOr art ... very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will or will tell you it it ... easily mark where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are we just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or having a kid have a traumatic experience with that\nSort of the way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer\nAnd absolutely I mean at the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and now there are rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know that they're probably not going to try to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gal\nAh or something along those lines so you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go in and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know if if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I like uh he's in he's in parts and what they do and how they train people in order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many\nUh and again there are there are there are scarce zone than their non scare zones or you know if you're going into a scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nAnd what are we going back and to take a look at that in greater detail in just a moment we'll talk sports Ninety seven one F.

Bosch animal that you rode over a um I guess as to be at least\nYears ago in order to do that or you know from now take here um you know people that love to ride roller coasters or or or get you on that statute that Russia or whatever you want to call it um they want will of course they're going to go higher they want to go faster and the manufacturers have a real problem because\nYou want to keep your writers conscious during the entire ride on friday and\nSo that you really have to to walk the line and of course but computer technology now uh it's actually a lot better know how many how much cheaper for so many the forces of body can take not a highly somebody who's experienced and trained to do that and in good physical shape\nSo that's the big key is to be able to make it stimulating exciting at the same time but not a you know I have any problems or have any negative effects that are that occur and that's why simulation rides are actually very big these days\nAnd what I mean by that is the track never actually really moves\nWhat happens is you actually have you with a three D. or forty glasses or you actually sit in an apartment or that looks like it's actually moving for example soaring is a classic example over at Disney where you think you're actually on hang glider and and being a pilot I can tell you it looks very real\nOr that this is all happening so the simulation writes like a much smaller footprint there are a little less money uh but at the same time you can get that same impression and if you don't like the right just close your eyes and it pretty much all goes away\nInteresting uh if you buy that we'd never experience these are these virtual environments that they can be pretty intense I I have a chance to do that a number of years ago and I can only imagine how much a better they've gotten with the passage of time [noise]\nDo any of these thrill rides a emulate a a real life version of let's say a video game but we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters and what about video games\nWell not necessarily video games because of their life since then and then there are certain details that you need to to follow but but you didn't mention like sitcoms like The Simpsons for example ah or different events like track of course the movie you'll find that universal studios\nBut as far as an actual mimic it it does mimic what goes on in fact nowadays the big thing happens to be on the old would roller coaster that really are not intense\nWhat you do is you put on the board the glasses that and they cover your entire face a wire going through a small a roller coaster and feeling the wind and the reason to your face\nOr what you're getting is you're actually getting a simulation ride or maybe out in outer space or something or or some other planet or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour\nBeijing where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour it goes up and down maybe a little bit is now more intense also that seems to be another way that they're revamping some of the old rides to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from Rita in Dallas on the jumbo had showed one eight six six five oh Jim bow and our guest beat tribute go Hi Rita\nI just wanted to share something with you uh we're now last week of the great ... state fair of Texas and my daughter took her four year old grandson to the fair and she told me that our state fair now has an information desk\nWhere they put a

know that child and fail Hi Tammy because of the name is on the inside but if a child gets lost\nThen they find their ... that\nThat's an interesting thought utterly of to say the least uh an encouraging one of the safety of general upbeat tribute goes that some people it's practiced and all of these are major theme parks and uh and scary rides\nYes it absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park is directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidence of problems that occurred at a particular place again you very rarely hear of a roller coaster incident and when it does happen\nIt'll be on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News or one of the major networks because it becomes a big news\nKind of like a plane crash so it doesn't happen very often security has been a stepped up especially at places like ah you know I was a Six Flags or Disney Busch Gardens are Cedar Fair or they do that on purpose because obviously we want them to everybody wants\nTo have a a a good outcome now the the carnivals and the fares that the state fairs\nAre starting to come on board with the same\nAh security and technology with the blade bracelets and so on down the line which is a very very good thing to have because these days you never know what's going to happen and you know we always tell people\nThey don't always go and pears always tell the parents where you're going to be in more most importantly don't go alone especially on on your age or you shouldn't be doing that but if that does happen there are a lot of security or devices that

be just focus on the election for just a little bit longer and again it's on what is going on in Texas uh I Know you've been following that race or the ... of representative ... a ... trying to unseat Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz\n[laughter] then I was in Texas earlier this week uh went to a couple of work advance he was trying to do some counter programming because it was the same day that President Trump was coming into town\nTo a campaign with crews and so he knew it was going to be a lot of attention to that so uh uh work held a eight events at his own going back and forth to different early voting sites and really trying pretty remarkable crowds take pictures with\nHundreds of people who wind up to ah to get a chance to meet and so certainly there's a lot of energy around and get Canada the weather there enough voters who who share his state of Texas\nTo get him elected it's still an open question he's obviously trailing in the polls um there was a great deal of enthusiasm surrounding President Trump's visit as well you know if they're watching this line of thousands of people thinking for hours as they tried to get in\nTo see the president of the United states this is a state that the president won by nine points um and uh and Ted Cruz or there's no question has an advantage there but interesting early voting numbers obviously this is a race that has really energized the electorate there\nWell you know I'm sure you saw the reports in the Houston Chronicle earlier in the week saying that quota shocking number of people turned out to vote on Monday they said it looked like a more like a Black Friday shopping morning then right through the line of for a vote\nShattered early voting records for mid term election in Texas not just in Houston but across the state and\nMid term election in\nTexas not just in Houston but across the state and but you know you have to be careful about drawing conclusions from early voting because sometimes all that means is that one sided very energized and they do a lot of their voting in early voting in there aren't that many people at\nThe ballot and the general election could also be that all the really enthusiastic people come out at the very beginning of early voting and then there's ... there's less at the end so it is noteworthy nominate on and we're keeping an eye on it but it's too soon to say what it means for that race\nNephew thanks to the river Nancy quarters with incredible new slow shoes achieve congressional correspondent for CBS\nYes indeed and a CBS his face the nation with John

Washington DC and a number one of six one Boston New report face the nation this Sunday at two pm on Bloomberg Radio are not going to want to miss that\nHas your attention right now about its movement in the two thousand Nineteen\n[noise] uh well I think it's the U.S consumer which has basically posted growth of four percent three of the last four quarters now I mean basically close to four percent um we've had pretty strong consumption grow so\nThat looks like that we quarter for consumer spending and the first quarter was was sort of the outlier um [noise]\nAnd I think that would make sense because we know that the labor markets are strengthening that's putting up or pressure on a real disposable income and ah we also know that consumer confidence is quite high um\nAnd we also know that consumer confidence has been quite sticky even in the face of hum volatility in the financial markets and you're on Bloomberg consumer comfort index which is what I think we're at least weekly\nThat's been generally throng all year even though we've had two meaningful drawdown than any us equities so um I think that stickiness incomes and confidence is um [noise]\nIs intriguing I'm On the down side business investment was skittish uh [noise] you know some of that a mining structures related um but it looks like you know we had a a decent gain and industrial equipment spending that was said by a [noise]\nA transportation equipment so you know I mean I you know I I wouldn't worry too much into that just yet I mean that contention that but it's long not nearly enough to justify this week uh aggregate equipment number\nHum and aren't spending is pretty healthy tells you that the companies are uh you know still still upbeat about the outlook correct them and they wouldn't be investing in our if they if they weren't thinking that so\nWell Neal you know when you talk about the consumer I Know that you're referring to Rosie's rules these are rules from a economist David Rosenberg of gloves skin chefs rule number twelve get the U.S consumer rights and everything else will take care of itself having said that\nRule eleven is highlight the risks to your forecasts what are these risks\n[noise] well I think there is you know first our elevator trade pensions weighing a continuing to sort of Dr ah economic uncertainty higher which depresses business fix investment um you know that would be a sort of a noose around productivity which would then create\nYou know potential inflationary consequences and the economy if productivity remained sluggish and the consumer I still sort of rolling along here hum\nThose around the manmade risks risks that is not intentional\nA risk that's not not that's not intentional\nYeah because you know these are the because you can model and risks that are put into various a political or economic uh contacts you can model that\nYou can say well you know if a loyal prices go up ... percent or if it becomes more expensive to import aluminum all those things but I'm Wondering what kind of risk outside of what is manmade would be a risk to your\n[noise] well I mean it's I mean to me the biggest potential risk I think is a is a is some sort of a policy a policy risk um so it wouldn't be manmade I mean in this case the fed\n'em [noise] you know to me the dollar is the big risk right I mean the dollar has been strengthening that continue on on corn flesh and\nHow you're seeing that again this morning we're on Bloomberg dollar index is basically running at a you know here today at highs and\nYou know if the fed is going to continue to signal hum\nAnd [noise] you know if the fed is going to continue to think no um you know basically a or a writer for time next year even as the corn flakes I mean just look at the number today you know I mean one point six percent on on the court the the the fighter exactly and okay talking about normal\nInterest right by the same pay if they didn't do anything getting less expensive

you're bad I mean okay I'll give you an example I have to give out more free I mean that's the sort of a high class problem by men just full disclosure but uh [noise] you know you have to basically give more free month rent to get a a prisoner of ten and through the door\nOr so my net effect of rent 'em you know on a property that I have is going down so you know I mean that on display sorry\nYou've got three fireplaces right now I don't go to a bar places on my you've got the little just for the inlaws off to the love that [laughter] you know something like that you know we're going to get to keep it short here three point five percent how will that be adjusted over the next two looks\n[noise] I mean I think that to me I Will probably see some moderation in the consumption number\nBut I think that's going to be offset the some extent or maybe equipment spending because our number looks for way too low given the kinds of data that we had on hand going\nInto ...

TV and Bloomberg Radio and he was talking about how perhaps because there has not been inflation and not necessarily inflation and the ... the report\nIs that it would it be encouraged to take their foot off the brakes and certainly you are seeing price into the fed funds future\nFuture contracts a sense that people are expecting fewer federal ... going forward given the latest sell\nOff and you look at what's going on in the bond market it you've got a ... a healthy bit in the bond market because look at the theater itself\nNineteen thirty seconds to yield is three points three percent so that the two year right next to point seven nine percent\nI guess what I was going to ask Dave is you know is there a sense in equity markets avoid it will take in terms of a sell off to get the Fed's attention\nWell that really is sort of a question in fact on the markets live blog that was the question of the day yesterday and\nI think we should have some kind of sound effect I think\nBasically a whole lot more than we've seen so far as the short answer a ripple effects and the credit markets ripple effects with interest rates are more of a decline of stocks than we see so the answer is more\nBasically answered the more they can I can I just studio\nOver a Goodyear Tire and Robert because I've been looking at the automobile companies as a ... a slow down going on in Europe we saw company there auto parts supplier ... down I think about\nNineteen percent at one point during trading today we heard for example Ford came out with a pretty good report stock rally but\nThey've already signaled that the market is tough\nAnd now you get Goodyear\nTire and rubber shares it down even though the company did pretty well for the past quarter they're looking at some challenges ahead\nAnd specifically China being one of the auto market there is slowing and you know that's a concern in terms of you know the company's uh ability to sell tires over there\nBut you know you see that show up with some other auto parts maker says well uh you look at this the on down a bit more than two percent to their numbers didn't look so great\nI'm here down over four percent right that's right and you can add auto lived to that although it's kind of a bounce back but it's only learn about that more than one percent which I like that is not bad\nBut there were talking seatbelts airbags that sort of thing so you know auto parts are clearly a spillover effect from what's happening in the auto industry more generally\nAll right I Am going to get in trouble for that Davis and I'm In a Siamese some homework\nOver the weekend I Am very I'm sure you already actually on that seem to have it on the top of your head but what I think we need to be talking about next week is market

in Washington DC nice to go there with the national headlines at\nLeast so now there are a dozen packages the FBI confirms is suspicious mailing address the Democratic senator Cory Booker has been recovered in Florida the NYPD is investigating another package reportedly to a former director of intelligence James Clapper and with CNN's address on it\nGDP Growth now we could have a productivity search I could happen but productivity is very difficult to protect\n'em and so far we've had very lackluster capital deepening that is the amount of capital investment per labor our during this expansion it really lax previous expansions and so that would suggest that productivity surge while possible is not something I Would bang on\nBut you put together are you in the folks that KPMG you put together this great chart where you break down all of the components of GDP and I want to go through some of them if you don't mind talk a little bit about residential investment\nYes so we actually looked at just to sort of analyze this question okay is twenty teens to put us on a different trajectory than the previous years in the expansion so we have took the first half an annual lies the pace of growth and now we've taken the first three quarters of the year and analyze the pace of growth\nAnd it looks pretty good consumption is a little stronger or we uh business investment inching up a little bit more\nUm but the thing that's really concerning is the presidential succinct document is down compared to um the full year twenty Seventeen of residential fix investment so that housing investment is down and that is a big concern because housing is a leading indicator\nAnd if you recall it prices started to turn for housing and two thousand and six when everybody was still popping the champagne and saying rah rah CDOs\nBut I Want to pick up exactly on this ... this decline for the first time since late ... early ... so this is a this is it unusual development this decline and residential investments and I'm just wondering\nGiven the fact that home ownership has changed and that more people rent fewer people own and have their sort of net worth tied up with their residence could it be different this time\nWell it could be different in terms of the impact on households and certainly\nI'm there have been tighter lending standards so I wouldn't expect if we even had a I mean and remember house prices declining is actually not the norm what happens when housing get soft or as you see less investment there you you see you don't see the multiplier effects of an expanding\nI'm expanding housing market and you don't see another housing crash cut me is that we basically in crisis but I but I think it's a warning sign in terms of the overall strength of GDP and there are some really important structural reasons why\nHousing has an advance I mean there that is one area where there are severe construction shortages\nAnother area where there are shortages as in transportation so getting the materials to the builders uh and then there's of course increase in prices for building materials even increasing cost of labor\nAnd increasing cost of materials\nAnd a shortage of labor so people can't do projects that they want to do so is this is a classic macroeconomic business cycle situation right this is exactly what causes slow down of the business cycle is you have supply constraints that prevent expansion and then in fact bring about declines\nTell us about business investment right now yeah so um we saw this quarter a decline in structures will look me actually go out to thirty thousand feet first\nSo business investment has been on an upswing for about six quarters seven quarters and\nUh when we started this year of course we had the tax law change and we saw a surge in business investment in the first half of the year so moving up around ten percent versus five point three percent falls twenty Seventeen now it's a little bit more moderate writes up six point three percent on an annual basis so\nA faster pace but a faster pace that you would expect this had been accelerating and I say you would expect absent any tax law change\nSo that this is going to be debated for a long time has this increase in business investment this year been as a result of the tax all change or result of the trend that was already under way at the end of twenty sixteen and into twenty Seventeen\nSo given the fact that we actually saw not a decrease but a slowdown in business ethics uh expenditures investments in the third quarter does that\nGive you confidence in one view or another in terms of the tax cuts playing a role or not\nI don't know um I mean it it and it doesn't even make me\nI don't know um I mean it it and it doesn't even make me overly concerned in general we sell structures declined but we saw um and we saw slower pace of growth\nIn an intellectual property and equipment but those numbers fluctuated in quarter to quarter it's also the first reading so I\nI'm not going to get overly concerned about that but if you if you think about how much of this with tax drive and I think it's too soon to see those results if you look at surveys of of business leaders\nAnd CEOs they say Seventy six percent of them say they weren't planning to change their investment plans based on the tax I'll change Anna's come and I were talking about before the show right that this is something that business leaders take a long time to plan\nIt's not something you really can do on the fly there's maybe a few

quickly you've come so I just wanted to it's an unfortunate thing probably will be with us for a while\nBut uh that's a word that we have to understand because it's used against us very much word

thank you the the Trump Administration proposed cutting what Medicare pays for many costly drugs for cancer and other conditions to match lower prices paid by European countries those governments more strictly controlled pharmaceutical cost the president made the announcement yesterday at the department of health and Human Services\nThe world groups the benefits of American Juniors and innovation well American citizens and especially our great seniors who are hit the hardest pick up to tip but no longer\nSee in Vermont is the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services she joins us now for more on this story by phone and administer it seems that the key component in this new plan is the international pricing index what is that how does it fit into this\n[noise] well that's a great question and just a little bit of background so as the president alluded to the United states and much more than other developed countries and we actually released a report about this yesterday and especially with that report showed is that we're paying a hundred and eighty percent more\nOn average and in some cases more than four hundred percent more\nThan the international average and so the proposal that the president put forward is to centrally faze down but Medicare payment for some selected part the drugs to more closely aligned with the international prices so\nOver five years we're gonna centrally bring in the discounts that are being provided to people overseas and bring those to the Medicare program to lower costs for\nOur seniors and over a five year period we would see 'em costs go down by an average of thirty percent and this would mean savings at seven team point two billion dollars for taxpayers and three point four billion dollars for Medicare beneficiaries\nHelped me out here on this international index does how do they determine the price do they sort of average around the world or was\nThat this that's exactly it we're going to look at some of the um the ... thing and other countries other industrialized countries\nOn Germany France Canada and there's a whole list of what we say developed countries that have similar economies to ours and we're going to look at the prices that are being offered on average overseas and were essentially going to bring those into the prices that we're paying\nThe problem that we have in the Medicare program is that worth actually a price taker and the part B program\nUm there is no negotiation and we're not getting any discounts and what we've seen in that program that that's our fastest area spend and the Medicare program we think costs go up and up\nAnd there's also been a lot of development of nearly fighting innovation and what we're seeing is at these new drugs that are coming out have price tags approaching half a million almost a million dollars\nSo it's not sustainable and it's not fair to Americans essentially we've than shouldering the burden of innovation and research for the entire world and we want these other countries to start paying their fair share because it's just not fair to our tax payers and it's not fair to America's seniors we want to put American patients first\nWhat about allowing Medicare to negotiate prices\nWell we have great negotiators in our part D program on and that was part D plans have brought negotiation and they have brought discounts and we see you know discounts and the part D program comparable to um\nTo discount that people are getting overseas it's really the problem is in our part B program where there is now\nAt negotiation going on and we are getting that the benefit of those discount\nSo can you change that would that require a congressional approval\nTo what we what we're doing here as we are proposing to do a demonstration project so\nAt what we would do is essentially try this out and about ... percent of our beneficiaries nationwide we would do this over a five year period and that is that the opportunity to steady the impact\nThat the authority that we have available to us if Congress wanted to do that they could change the law but I'm the story that we had to do a demonstration project to test this new way of paying for a part of the drugs to bring lower costs for our seniors\nKnowing announcing his proposals yesterday the president said that he's been seeing is a disparity for years and he's certainly in a position to\nIn a position to fix it how long has this been going on\nGoing on for years and we all hear the stories that people traveling to other countries to get lower price medications and this has been going on for a very long time\nAnd the president has been very committed to lowering prices for um for American and this is a demonstration of his commitment is a very bold no he's making 'em and he's making it clear that he wants to put that American patience birth and it's not fair to our taxpayers and that's not fair to seniors to pay these higher I drive\nOr last thirty seconds will lower revenues a lower profits for drug companies hurt research and development an innovation\nThat's a great question and I'm Glad you asked that when we look at the savings and a number that we are talking about the Seventeen point two billion dollars a three point four billion in savings for patients\nWe know that that is if you know roughly one percent of what pharma is spending on research and development so that should not impact them and I think they had the ability to figure out how they can make out that one percent and this is going to be faced and so they had the opportunity to renegotiate their agreements with other countries\nThat we support innovation and the the proposal that we've put together keep that in mind that we want to keep America in a position of producing like saving medications but our proposal would only have a one percent impact on that research and development budget\nSeem of Irma administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services thank you for that up for your insights they're coming up a job or politics policy of power and law one judge in Texas could decide the future of Obamacare but first let's circle back to the moon for a check on world the national news\nNews talk one easy of radio [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd thank you for joining us I'm Alex solving our top story this hour coming from plantation Florida where the man arrested in connection with a string of suspicious packages sent the top Democrats is charged with five federal crimes and faces fifty years behind bars\nIn a press briefing today attorney general Jeff Sessions announced the charges against or say junior noting that the allegations that he faces are seeing\nCharges against Caesar say junior noting that the allegations that he faces are serious\nIs being charged to die with five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former

officials also warn there could be still more packages in transit and reminded the public to remain vigilant they added the ideas that were recovered are not hoax devices and consistent of multiple bomb making materials and meanwhile for more suspicious packages\nAre intercepted bringing the total number two fourteen billion or Democrat donor Tom's dire became the latest target today when authorities found a suspicious package address to him at a postal facility in Birmingham California now this comes and federal officials investigate three more suspicious packages addressed the senators calmly Harris\nCory Booker and former national intelligence director James Clapper those packages weren't found a postal facilities all across California Florida and New York laid on Thursday night and early this morning\nAnd we're learning more about fifty six year old suspect Cesar ... junior officials said that he's from Avon turtle Florida and it's a long criminal history including charges of that\nDomestic violence and a prior bomb threat it was also revealed that he had a previous bankruptcy filing and on his twenty told tax filing lifted his income is four thousand dollars while reports allege he was a Republican media reports so we only follow Democrats on Twitter\nAnd President Trump is sounding off on the arrest praising the efforts of federal and state authorities the president took to Twitter today applauding the FBI the secret service and the Justice Department including authorities in New York for their incredible work skill and determination\nSeveral packages were intercepted this week spending across multiple states across the country and earlier today the president called the acts by the suspect terrorizing and despicable and some political violence should never happen\nAnd President Trump does again calling on Congress to pass\nLegislation legislation addressing illegal immigration to secure the nation's borders in a tweet today the president said the U.S spends billions of dollars a year on illegal immigration but that will not continue adding Democrats must vote to pass strong but there are laws\nHomeland security secretary cures Nielsen echoed his comments will turn into first completed section of the president's thirty foot high border wall in Southern California\nShould not be a part is an issue it seems that many in Congress are currently suffering from Asia in two thousand six Congress passes secure fence act with broad bipartisan support\nBorder security is national security and it is vital to our mission of protecting the homeland\nShe also commented on a possible executive order to address it might have been ... saying the administration is reviewing all legal options and everything is on the table and this comes into migrant caravans totaling nearly ten thousand people are currently bans thing through the ... through Mexico towards the U.S border when America's emerald Robinson has more from the White House\nThat's all right at the caravan of mostly Hungarian ... migrants from ants about a thousand miles from the southern border that President if that could be considering taking an executive order action to stop\nThat migrate from entering the U.S that would include stopping them from taking that Thailand and now the president tweeted not very long ago that the United states has been spending billions of dollars a year on illegal immigration that's will not continue Democrats and not getting the boat to patch strong but there are laws\nIf not we won't be forced to pay play a much tougher\nNow this news comes after that minister I did decide to send\nSomewhere between eight hundred thousand more troops\nJoined with the national guard troops that are down there at the border now to provide support again ever shore if there'll be armed aren't what kind of support and they will provide to the current National Guard there however again that President considering perhaps had executive order to take action however the White House at that time it not providing comment\nOn that news bacteria\nThank you enrolled in his migrants inch closer to the U.S border many are wondering how the caravan started and who may have funded when America's jak ... down with former CIA officer Brad Johnson to learn more\nCapital welcome back here and one American news Brad Johnson Americans for intelligence reform today I wanted to sit down and talk to you about this\nCaravan of migrants now in your own background as a former CIA officer you you spent some time a lot of time in Latin America is All right that's correct gifts and very familiar with the area is\nSo based on your knowledge of the area of your own background in the area station there um who is behind this caravan and what is the goal with with these we've seen one in April now one in October that's on its way right now to the U.S border\nVice president Pence several days go now ... what do you learn from the Honduran president which was that Venezuela is backing a lot of this a lot of the impetus of this taking place\nNow the implications out of what that means are absolutely fantastic I mean there should ordinarily important in a dangerous one Venezuela comes from a kind of family now that has been\nCreated within Latin America all the extreme left countries in certainly including Nicaragua in Cuba and Bolivia and Venezuela [noise] uh they're all associated now very closely with Iran\nAnd Iran has the officers intelligence officers imbedded in their military intelligence agents and their military units and their intelligence units so their uh their funding for all of this now we know Venezuela's good economic problems but they're funding is being driven out of of Iran's talking\nAbout essentially is in a rainy and soft power psychological operations that they're running through Venezuela as we've seen similar running operations with divorce or at least more in terms of their support if the terrorists throughout the region in other parts of the world and it's it's always been a hallmark of Iran is not right to use the soft power\nAbsolutely but I Would take it a step further because the doctrine that's being promoted and this was originally started oddly enough by Carlos the jak who now it's an old historical figure most people won't be familiar with\nBut he started a movement that was talking about the linking up of radical Islam and the radical leftist movements within Latin America that they need to join because they have the common enemy of the United states now that has grown and been worked upon and has now become the doctrine of the day for all of those groups\nIn countries and what they're talking about in their main strategy is to use a symmetrical warfare against the United states\nTo just keep pecking away at the United states and and chip away and make it a smaller weaker country at all times and this column marching towards the United states is a very good example of precisely what that looks like\nOne of the hallmarks I think of asymmetrical warfare is the fact that they've been very clear that in every picture every photo op that you see them they are carrying what they're carrying the Honduran slack\nWhile they're funded from different sources and some of it you see out of the extreme left\nHonduran slack\nWhile they're funded from different sources in some of you see out of the extreme left here in the United states\nAnd there is an association I mean everyone they you often hear reference to it was a term used previously but fellow travelers and it was a term used among the Senate is this socialist international movement and agreements of goals to damage the United states to reduce its effectiveness on the world stage\nAnd that agreement across the board admit creates this fellow traveler syndrome if you will well they're all helping an overlapping and\nWild leap stream left here in the United states supporting these front groups that you've always heard him mentioned like car and so on they may not be an actual contract with Iranian intelligence all that's all overlapped in this big conglomeration of these cooperative groups that shared goals\nAnd thankfully President Trump at least I think instinct truly kind of understands the threat that poses and is now pushing forward with policies to shut this down and to combat this instead of just allowing that Brad thank\nYou so much for coming all of us so they were going to be keeping an eye on this and following us develops as we get closer for border to project thank you very much\nThinking jak and turning our attention back home President Trump is returning to North Carolina as he continues to push for the candidates added

Johnson Americans for intelligence reform today I wanted to sit down and talk to you about this\nCaravan of migrants now in your own background a former CIA officer you knew spent some time a lot of time in Latin America is All right that's correct yes very familiar with the areas\nSo based on your knowledge of the area of your own background in the area station there um who is behind this caravan and what is the goal with with these we've seen one in April now one in October that's on its way right now to the U.S border\nVice president Pence several days go now to what he learned from the Honduran ... which was that Venezuela is backing a lot of this a lot of the impetus of this taking place now the implications out of what that means are absolutely fantastic I mean they're just ordinarily important dangerous one Venezuela\nComes from a kind of family now that has been created within Latin America all the extreme left countries certainly including the ... into Libya and Venezuela they're all associated now very closely with the\nWell in Cuba and Bolivia and\nVenezuela a they're all associated now very closely with Iran\nAnd Iran's has a officers intelligence officers imbedded in their military intelligence units and their military units and their intelligence units and also their uh their funding for all of this now we know Venezuela's good economic problems with their funding is being driven out of of Iran's talking\nAbout essentially is an Iranian soft power psychological operations that they're running through Venezuela this we've seen similar Ronnie operations with divorce or at least more in terms of they're supportive of terrorists throughout the region in other parts of the world and it's it's always been a hallmark of er at is that right to use the soft power\nAbsolutely but I Would take it a step further because the doctrine that's being promoted and this was originally started oddly enough by Carlos the jak old who've mouse and old historical figure most people will be familiar with\nBut he started a movement that was talking about the Lincoln up of radical Islam and the radical leftist movements within Latin America that they need to join because they have the common enemy of the United states now that has grown and been worked upon and has now become the doctrine of the day for all of those\nGroups who countries and what they're talking about in their main strategy is to use a symmetrical warfare against the United states to\nJust keep pecking away at the United states and and chip away and make it a smaller weaker country at all times and this column marching towards the United states is a very good example of precisely what that looks\nLike one of the hallmarks I think of asymmetrical warfare is the fact that they've been very clear that in every picture every photo op that you see them they're carrying what they are carrying the Honduran slack\nWhile they're funded from different sources and some of you see out of the extreme left here in the United states and there was an association I mean everyone they will you often hear reference and it was a term used previously but fellow travelers and it was a term used among the Senate it's this socialist international movement and agreement\nOf goals to damage the United states to reduce its effectiveness on the world stage and that agreement across the board admit creates this fellow traveler syndrome if you will well they're all helping an overlapping and\nWhile league stream left here in the United states supporting these front groups that you've always already mentioned like car and so on\nAh they may not be an actual contract with Iranian intelligence to all that's all overlapped in this big conglomeration of these cooperative groups that shared goals\nAnd thankfully President Trump at least I think instinctual a kind of understands that threat that poses and is now pushing forward with policies to shut this down and to combat this
