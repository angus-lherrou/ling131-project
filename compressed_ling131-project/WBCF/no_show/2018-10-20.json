show\nYeah isn't it\nThe halftime show yes and it\nI mean I I'm not sure I get it it's it's the most watched program or the in the top two anyway or of the year generally speaking and she doesn't want to be on it because she supports Colin Kaepernick\nDid I get that right\nThat's yeah that's what I read I mean whatever\nAnd by the way your microphones fine as you're pressing like this during the break is very low so don't worry don't build back here um\nFor me a couple of things I think ... is a good singer I think she's a beautiful woman clearly I'm not as educated on this topic is maybe like her to be but why would you throw away and opportunity like that\nBecause of a guy who of his own volition is out of a league\nPolo when I say in your room or in the NFL now but I Am I used to be a great expert in the ... now now for three years and I will go back and watch it must be all stand for the national anthem in the NFL starts whining S's you're fine to stay in the valley to do that I'm not going to support them\nBut let me make sure that I have the ... story right he was the starting quarter the quarterback for San Francisco\nTook him to the super bowl the last of the ravens several years ago double threat running in passing the quintessential athlete and it looked like more NFL quarterbacks would be like him because of how successful he was then the defense of starting figure them out and it wasn't as effective anymore instead of getting better\nHe was getting worse and then he ended up being the second string quarterback was behind Alex Smith\n[noise] ah no I think by that time there and he turned them away okay and then they had when we have backup ... than when I was yeah\nRight All right so um he's he's ride the bench and out of the blue you start sitting down for the national anthem once the cameras realized that he started kneeling for the national anthem then some other guy would deal with them than other players were league which started kneeling and when he was asked about it he was wearing like a Fidel Castro shirt\nAnd a sure was Malcolm X. on it or something and he's talking about oppression and he's talking about I mean honestly\nTo me the whole thing is weird man\nBecause he was a guy who had a contract to ... eleven or twelve million dollars a year now there was and this is not widely reported there was a another year on his contract it was a player option you that would have given him nine to all of a million dollars even though he was just a backup\nYou walked away from that in San Francisco one would assume because he thought that there would be a long term contract and even more money waiting for him elsewhere well guess what crickets happened they didn't get another offer and then you start hearing that the ravens wanted to talk to them then you started hearing that the Denver Broncos wanted to talk to him and he's complaining the entire time but he's not been blacklisted from the NFL because he's dealing\nWhich didn't happen\nIn fact John Elway said we offered him the opportunity to be here and he said no he didn't want to be here so he could be in the NFL Marianna is not doing the super bowl halftime show 'cause she's showing support for him and I guess she thinks that he's been black Boulder blacklisted from the NFL because of his kneeling ... is that why she's doing it\nIt's got to be white right probably but I also think that it has lots new into them connections to Jay Z\nWe'll just have to do with it in a couple of years ago beyond seem to have time show she's married to him right now is before the whole ... thing happened and then now since then are you sure yeah\nI thought Kaepernick already was feeling\nNow and then nothing new environment the barn\nHe might have been nearly but he was so what you're saying he was still in the league right now the league right\nI I don't get it unless you don't get it they got good story is told his true right he\nTurned down an opportunity to be on the Denver Broncos he walked away from his last year was contract I'm not making it up and I\nKnow well\nThen what did she complaining about it was his own dumb decision that that led into this\nAnd he still claiming that he's still working out and and I guess Randy if he wanted him but I don't\nGet that he should try it again in Denver offer that nobody has has given me any good information to say the gentle way was lying so it may maybe you take the offer that's all that's on the table\nMakes use of the good really and I'll take calls and ... if you can't go through just go to ... talk show on Twitter as I said I live tweet here's this guy Dusten I was going to say his name but he has called in a in Kansas City\nWho wrote to be on my Facebook page and there was a ... little child when I didn't respond and fast enough I guess you didn't realize that it was actually working at the time and I couldn't respond to his crazy negative review of me uh so he's on the line now and look I I'll I'll give them credit for actually having a set big enough to call the program Dr let's go man let's mix it up what are you got\nIt is there a you invited me and so here I Am\nI did I invited you because you were ... stupid on my Facebook page alleging that I I was taking too long to answer your your bad review I'm working why when I started out why would I used to while they stopped working to answer your dumb review it why would I Do that\nBut you stop to work in a long enough to call me clueless\nAnd tell your clue is right it's our time took me two seconds to write clueless but now that you're on the air so me and what what is it that I have Ron let's go\nWhat you have you told me that I Know it it's not clear listen I should call the show and you tell me why\nNo no no I didn't tell you didn't shy anywhere I show me where I called you idiot and and told you that I Would tell you why you wrote event you got it okay here here's a bit\nSo that stop ... stop what you like stop stop\nThis isn't gonna work you can't talk when I talk because nobody can hear you\nHere's the thing I gave an overview to my listeners of what you wrote which was basically I lean Republican my whole life but it's horrible with the Republicans will be gone have become everybody that I Know is going to stop voting Republican and in fact I'm going to do all I tend to vote Democrat and there's a I'm going to vote Democrat in this coming election now tell me how someone\nThat's exactly what you said tell me it really isn't\nGoing to put you on hold here here's a way it's going to work dust and this was a nationally syndicated radio show your heard by about five or six million people right now and so far you sound a little bit on educated\nEven what you you wrote yourself because of how far the Republican Party went away from what you believe in you decided you could never vote Republican again in factory to do what you can devote Democrat that's what you said I said you're clueless if you'd like to correct that I'm listening to your go ahead\nI guess right as I said I said it's because of the girls the Carter from traditional Republican values there\nSo what is it the Democrat how ... what is it the immigrants are offering to your article ... what is it the Democrats are offering to you that you would vote for them\nThey don't tell me what they're offering that you would give them your vote tell me I get my vote and I knew that let's go okay\n[laughter] wow [laughter] like I said there and it it it's just a factor from\nFrom from the traditional none of the Democrats going that they'll get\nYour vote for ... that I\nWho that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway and areas\nThat may be a Republican wouldn't cause the Democrat even though their party has drifted more and more in Israel in Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nHe's in he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positive\nYou know it's interesting to me run in and I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic I'm In Florida\nYou know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics than in South Florida\nUm and it's just different than I think what you would see in Texas or California um and then of course in central Florida you know we had a burgeoning population of people who are Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually endorsed by the sitting congresswoman from Puerto Rico\nA he's a Republican and a friend of mine and so I think the reason\nWhy Florida we're doing good it's because we're producing economic opportunity\nAs Republicans I mean we're below us ... unemployment and the history of our country and it's hot and I think we can do even better in Florida\nYou can do that though if you do what Gillum wants to do which has raised taxes forty percent a single payer health care you know on and on it does that would really be the end of Florida's economic momentum so I think a lot of these are\nReally across the border and looking at it and say you know I Want to be able to have a good job I'm going to be able if I work hard to be able to get ahead well clearly if that's what you're looking to do that on your guy because I'm going to build upon us if that's Florida has has had economically I Am not going to tear it down with can fifth get tore pots policy\nIt's a run run as soon as he used a Republican running for governor of the great state of Florida former congressman from down there but let me talk specifically about school school safety you know that I'm a good friend of a republic will course tragically lost his daughter meadow in Parkland, Florida and then there's the high school in February fourteenth that area of the state was put on the international map\nAs ground zero of gun control versus you know armed guards at the schools\nUm you've got people on school boards like this guy Runcie who is a promise program Obama guy who will ignore the the violent criminal history of students just said that they don't have a a a record when they get out of school for some reason\nOr what can you do should you become the governor I Hope you will become a governor I think you're gonna but what can you do from that offers from a position\nTo stop allowing sheriff's like Israel to turn a blind eye to a bad guy who could walk on campus and kill a bunch of people to get people off school boards like ... who is going to ignore criminal records of people like this Eighteen Nineteen fifty three fifty eight I don't see his name I see his his prison number will can you do from that position and from that offers\nTo shore up our schools and guaranteed her kids are gonna come home at the end of the day\nIf you had the way Florida works is if you have and if they're so like the Sierra who's elected countywide are the guys that are kind of remove them from office um and I said after part\nI'm an officer saying a share of Israel though on the um blame other people in power cow for the cameras not be honest with the people a Broward County\nI said if I were the governor and I would have removed Israel I think that was appropriate thing to do what I'm In the ... the ... I'm a former navy by right when the when the ... around\nThe captain of the ship is held accountable that's just the way it is\nA Israel was saying hey I gave the guy a badge what am I supposed to do not my problem that's not leadership that passing the buck right and I thought it was disgraceful the way he handled themselves so that is one tool you have but obviously I'm working with the end the\nPower as well to make sure that we do what we need to do legislatively outside of the school districts are able to protect\nTheir students and some school districts will do a much better job and I think Andy had a lot of them are getting the Broward school district is heavily bureaucratic a lot of very left wing ideas\nBut listening to read and he was trying to ... in the school board members so that they couldn't remove runs the exam and they they narrowly lost so is that you know within this I was disappointed to see that because I agree with you run sees policies helped facilitate what happened in park like\nIran would you leave it in a guy like renting judge in Polk County to to sort of be a guide to other counties he's doing great work there as far as school safety goes\nAbsolutely I mean we were in ... county couple of days ago grade he endorsed me with a bunch of the other Sharon right that that's a huge huge job plus for me in this great have almost a unified support of law enforcement throughout the state of Florida partially because I've been very strong and support them and have a great\nWealth of the part of the bill on me usually hospital for the men and women and law enforcement and they realize that he's dead and are there going to have a target on the ... is that he will damage dog the police and he will use law enforcement of the political football\nI agree with you it's a round as soon as Republican running for governor the great state of Florida is to Andrew Gillum let me just give you some good kids in about a minute that we have remaining I really appreciate your time run a taxation that looks like a tax cuts to point over on deck here if the house should go to the Democrats next\nCuts to point over on deck here if the house you go to the Democrats that's not going to happen as the governor of a state would you support the president and continuing to lower our taxes as ... or people in the United states\nBam right\n[laughter] that was that was pretty quick I'm All right I'm pro life obviously argue for defunding Planned Parenthood even on the state level\nSo yeah so absolutely\nUh when it comes to this caravan of illegal immigrants coming toward border what should we do we can't just keep on giving up because I Know the government wants to give a path to citizenship for anybody who can speak across the board or what do you do\nThat were there on he wants to abolish ice and he wants to open borders on Wednesday\nThe ... just be able to go in that foreigners get to determine who comes to our country not read the American people but I think the president actually use whatever tools rented disposal I think the Caribbean needs to be turned back we've got to insist on the rule of law you can't have people just barking into the country\nI'm In the middle of the border and it just doesn't work and so I Know that by getting monitoring\nI think he will take some sort of ... uh and I think if we can turn the caravan around I think the debate and we've got to stop him mad at our southern border\nIf you were the governor yesterday to send National Guard from Florida there to protect our borders what'd you\nIt would depend on what that means we're like obviously we have a lot of them being not helping with the hurricane right now ... now this may not be the best time for it but if I had a free our resources that some free time I think it is important because that when the drugs come over the border you\nKnow that affects Floridians I mean the fence and all the ... the big problem in our state and I think that if we're able to turn that back that would be a good thing\nI Know that ... for equalizing schools and education by by forcing more taxation and more public schools use against the school vouchers are you for or against vouchers\nOh we have we have a hundred and thirty thousand in\nMany of them low income on various scholarship program run into one ... and all of it right or those I think that they're successful\nAnd they're in a variety of different ways whether it's low impact whether special me when we have a scholarship program for kids at a polling in school or their parents and find a safe environment and you cut the scholarship and forced them back into the school where they are being bullied though he is very ideological about that even though these programs more\nWould literally pull the rug out from underneath whose family\nGive out dream scholarships like this obviously exponentially help lower income people why the left would be against it as not to be run and I really appreciate your time and how busy you are on the Republican running for governor of the great state of uh of Florida it's wrong to see it as just do it again OK\nOkay thank you appreciate you that's a wrong to see it as if you're listening in form I Hope you'll see really consider voting for the man he's going to be the right guy for the job in my opinion and hopefully

have a presidential election and there are candidates many many candidates for the Democrats there's one particular candidate for the Republicans\nHe is a very careful ... prepare of the grounds for the next candidate for the next contest Donald Trump so I welcome Dan ... the deputy editor to the editorial page of the wall Street Journal writing and his wonderland about a candidate that Mr Trump\nAt this point is indicating he thinks he must deal with now because in two years' time it would be too late if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee for the Democratic party down a very good evening to you Elizabeth Warren was in the news this week oddly making remarks\nAbout how much DNA she could link to Native Americans who may or may not have been a tribe the Cherokee that she linked herself to anecdotally but your column suggests that I was wrong to presume that she'd made herself a laughing stock good evenings you'd\nEither John well I don't know whether I Would go so far as to say that um you were wrong that she'd made herself laughing stock the issue that I was trying to raise is a ... ... what does it which audience matters most um\nPeople you would expect to be mocked in ridiculing you or ... as I put it\nYour political base and um I think what Elizabeth Warren has figured out a Donald Trump kind of broke\nThe conventional wisdom about how you go about that um people forget them back in twenty sixteen won a Trump was running through the primaries from beginning to launch his presidential campaign\nThat uh the his number of what is the time\nCentral campaign that ah that his number of what is the time were thought to be verbal gaps\nWas were almost count bus I mean he just said things you would assume that we're going to get him run out of politics such as the fact that John McCain was no hero because he got captured a people thought\nIs done it's over well ah he [laughter] he wasn't done he's in the White House right now and I think what a Trump understood that then was that I'm a celebrity and politics or had become the coin of the realm and even if it's tarnished at times\nYou got to get your name up there in light\nAnd uh what Elizabeth Warren has done a risk getting a mockery by a lot of people\nUh is that ah she put herself up there as a primary opponent of Donald Trump how do we know that because Trump keeps talking about our keeps calling her Pocahontas and uh it's Trump's way of cutting to run her down and ridicule her\nBut um she in her way\nYou know return fire a with this DNA report and it is\nAt some level absolutely

depriving the people of the GDP even a currency any any hope of an infrastructure because of the drying up of resources with the sanctions will that bring the regime down\nMichael a very good evening to you I remember the lessons from Eastern Europe\nThat I connected immediately with your observations that at PJ Media the observations were when the regimes fell apart in Eastern Europe this is\nOf the early Nineteen nineties the late Nineteen eighties about time of the Soviet collapse\nIt was not from the bottom it was from the top you needed to know that the leadership no longer a bait orders and that there was new leadership\nHow do you measure this effort to bring down Iran by so so so beggar ring the population that there'll be something like the best deal good evening to\nA drunk thank you uh well two things\nUh first of all those kind of a a vulgar march to submit work we're told that if things get bad enough there will be revolution sued the as sue for evolution was something that just happen naturally they're part of the\nNormal course of events when in Rio or do you uh revolutions are here and most of the time they fail\nAnd most of the time they happen not when things are getting worse but when things are getting better and to you can go back to the French Revolution was things were getting better even though we're your quote with the meat cake for ...\nAnd a Hitler came to power as things were getting better in Germany you loose we came to power with these were getting better ... to circle war\nAnd all that so it's it's actually the opposite of the conventional was from the ages so off which is so true ah I\nI just a ... a detail here Michael because I don't know what you're saying is correct all historical evidence points to that\nIt's puzzling to me that this administration and the last administration both believed and from different sides of the same coin\nThat encouraging the population with a generous a allowances allowing trade to come in again or discouraging the population as the Trump Administration chooses both both the Obama and the Trump people believed\nIn that what you call crude Marxism they believe that the economics was going to drive the story\nRight right they all believe that\nAnd and most were punished ... and apparently most were policymakers belief that 'cause they keep on saying we don't want to change the regime we want to change its behavior and how are we going to change its behavior sanctions\nWere going to make some more miserable and it says if there was some kind of magical tipping point\nWhere when things got better know for the Iranian people that were going to rise up for the change the shape and I don't think that's what happens I think that we're gonna have to sport revolution as we did in the Soviet Union\nThey are talking about the revolution of the ... days are supporting dissidents and putting pressure on human rights violations that that\nParting dissidents and putting pressure on human rights violations that that that is what undermined the leadership and the Soviet Union\nYeah that's correct\nAnd uh and and we reached out to the dissidents and the Soviet Empire\nAnd what he said okay we're with you what do you need and it turned out the things they need to work all that difficult I mean they needed above a means to communicate with one another\nAnd ah they need that in order to tell each other how things were going all over the place so\nPeople in Leningrad had snow what was going on in Moscow and what was going on and ... and so forth\nAnd love and the best way to do that was the radio so that's why our radios were sort of true revolutionary instruments so they had\nA Radio Free Europe radio liberty voice of America all of these broadcasts going in\nSo that we could tell them what was happening there\nWe're not doing that in ... in the case of Iran ... we're not talking to the Iranian people are broadcasting guard first language broadcasting into Iran is is not very aggressive\nAnd so for the most part people who run than up racial lurk carry over from the old days\nAnd they tend to support the regime as Obama did Trump doesn't support the regime but\nTrump doesn't seem to get that if you don't want that regime to go on you've got to go after it you don't have to fight and he's not doing that\nMichael I wouldn't want to remind everyone that you wrote about the green revolution back in two thousand and nine and the people who led the green revolution the solo election that the military code that put a needed ... Dina shot in power before ...\nThey were under house arrest the last time I checked on them and you have you had a plane that in door seeing the green revolution and encouraging that leadership and it's a technical in all cities was a positive thing to do is that still positive I mean is that still possible\nOh yes absolutely possible easy better than ... ...\nIt's it's ... it's easy to do is make a few personnel changes as I keep saying\nThe thing that the Trump Administration does worst is person now they make terrible personnel decisions they have not changed\nA Farsi radio management or they do not have we have all kinds of leading this would have to remember that guy\nUh but to be who was on the cover of the economy was holding up his bloody T shirt yes yeah well we use here in Washington and you'd think they wouldn't have him on the air all the time but they use you know was if he didn't exist and there are many others like\nYes I speak to another ... every few weeks he he was a member of the government at one point he's now in Washington a prominent journalist and Farsi is quite capable of telling the facts to the people in Iran I'm surprised that he's not an used\nYeah I'm I'm Amazed just honest and just made all those things it's very discouraging spring going on forever\nAnd so for some reason the United states of America which is arguably the most revolutionary country in the world may be in the history of the world does not use revolution as an instrument or foreign policy\nWhen it's our most lethal instruments against these charities and all the tyrants now and they ...\nThey're scared to death or the ... if you see what Rouhani says what combination says they all talk about the United states try to foster a white revolution which is saying non violent\nA peaceful transformation those through regime and they know that that can bring them down them but we don't we don't go to\nMichael the dean of the foundation for the defense of democracies riding most recently in PJ Media about the imminent heavier sanctions on Iran and will they work no\nI'm John bachelor you know the John ...

we we do guns well we just don't do open transparency at all\n... ... as you look at tech and what it does to open markets there are in in the news cycles that you see on your show every night\nThere it's a very very difficult now to hide things or to obstruct things from the populist and tech continues to be that open wave for good or for bad that\nIt it shines a light on the right or wrong

embrace that outcome and are willing to invest and grow those businesses\nThe final detail is a little abstract but here it goes pursuing openness is that a good thing to do in a qualities is a conversation around the world\nThis reports suggest that what we need is more equal access to capital translate that Chris what does that mean more equal access does that mean you can go to market or that you have an opportunity at the bank how do you how do you interpret that\nYeah so what in being a a technologist from the Midwest um\nUse the United states is a perfect example there's not a tremendous amount of venture\nCapital private equity in the heartland when you compare it to say Boston or New York or Silicon Valley you have concentrations in that happens and us but it happens around the world as well where venture capitalists and private equity in many cases will chase successes but they get cluster they don't\nBreak out of their shell don't break out of innovation access\nTo capital for ideas across a wide variety of markets and opportunities it obviously best and most interesting to have as broad access to capital in the private equity or venture capital world is as possible but you see companies that\nQuite frankly with out capital may be better off in many cases because they learn the tough lessons of how to manage a business more efficiently or how to build a market from a a more gorilla perspective and not become dependent on that capital but access to capital can certainly be something that restricts rapid growth if it is not available in the

Know you were thinking it's not going to be violent but they thought that too and Eighteen sixteen or Eighteen sixteen they thought that too in Seventeen fifty nine or the dispute with the crown\nSo we entertain the possibility that there's a low probability of violence but there it is Michael about to bloom early it's very difficult readily can be as cut off as everything the blue ... but I saw a commercial where a democratic hopeful\nIs campaigning on the idea that she will restore\nThe tax deduction for New Jersey homeowners meat we know that as chiefly a matter of the elites because the New Jersey and New York taxes are so high that when you get to the duck them\nIt's a painless way of New Jersey and new and New York the blue kingdoms maintaining their power making the federal budget pay a fine\nThat was eliminated by the rascals Republicans in the last in this Congress that they're voting against it struck me that the Democrats are straining here not to go forward Michael not really a vision of a new thing they're looking to say we had a good why did you messed it up that's how I heard that commercial\nWell the\nProblem that Democrats face of it is one of going through a difficult adjustment a Republican or a read a elites are no smarter than their Democrat\nI rye emphasize that there that the the leadership is feeling its way here it's it does have on the outside of the Javits Center and know what we're doing\nI I Would suggest humbly that it was a gift the ... election of twenty ten and the election of Iraq Obama in that it it tended to set in train\nA tumultuous process of reconsideration and the Tea Party or in in the larger cultural sense really did a the Republicans a big favor because what it is dead is bring front and center the demands of\nThe people to be represented\nBy their leaders and to get out of the Washington thing and you know the leadership did not do that and the one person who did what Trump and that's why he swept away all all of the contenders he faced and the nomination process and twenty six team and in fact\nThe uh red politically that is has stolen the march\nOn blue because it is at the advantage of of being awake and to this earlier they the southern platter aristocracy before the civil war now I'm not comparing the two obviously in terms of their belief system\nBut I Am comparing them to the difficulty of making adjustments to a changing reality in effect change in society\nThey're not as adaptable they the plan are aristocracy would rather go to civil war\nThen come up with an alternative solution\nAnd this it seems to me is the challenges faced by blue elites and it's it's a bad it by the fact\nThat they are so increasingly out of touch with regular people\nAnd what we're saying for example in California which is hemorrhaging or a ... you know who are fleeing to places like California the Pacific northwest and the only people coming in the California these days are yuppies the rich and that bodes ill\nWe've got thirty ... already\nI I I Do not believe in your article you find any more sustainability for the ... they're being used right now but they're not their future is bright unless they change also we have got thirty seconds\nBest right and a red elite such as they are or have been scrambling but they've got a long way to go and in fact\nThe the larger outcome of of the civil war but I Believe is is sweeping American society will inevitably create a a a different set of elites eventually and that of course is the reason you have civil wars or is that\nYou can't achieve\nChange and readjustment any other way and that's perhaps unfortunate because of the violence that it was on leashes\n[noise]\nFirming show used them find Richard Denison Fox News

I read from the reporting that the U.S has\nMore unprovoked shark attacks than any other nation that was true in twenty Seventeen or that nationwide we have a lot more than fifty and Florida has a lot of attacks is there a pattern here that's emerging Chris or is this is this just better data\nAnd or something like the shock lab um accumulating the data\nWell there's a number of factors involved in this so one factor is now I get so much media attention that when these incidents occur they always get reported fifty sixty eight years ago you know it was sometimes never reported or sometimes that people never made it back to the beach to know that\nAn incident occurred and the other thing is we actually don't refer to these two shark attacks anymore because we don't know the motivation of the shark\nSo we simply refer to them a shark bite so until we figure out you know whether the sharks intent was to deliberately tax something um it could be just simply mistaken identity shark didn't know what it was he thought it was a a food item it bit into it and it's decided we just don't taste good\nSo that really isn't an attack that's I'm a sampling if you will but nonetheless a little bite from a big shark\nCan do a lot of damage and\nWhat's remarkable and what we've seen in more recent years is the severity of some of these little fights so to speak and how many people survive those and that's really attributed to first responder um responses and and and said in these people\nSo we're getting more data because we have more survivors and we move quicker and our communication system allows us to know when something's going on in Cape Cod and two weeks later going on in San Diego county that's why\nWell that's one of the reasons the other reason is there more people using the ocean recreation than ever before in history and in the U.S we have locations in our country where people can use the water year round\nAnd they do show when you think about how people use the ocean now for recreation and how much time different user groups spending the ocean like surfers swimmers the borders waiter stand up paddle borders when you look at the amount of time they actually spending the ocean now\nIs exponentially greater than it was twenty thirty fifty years ago\nSo that's the other thing that we have to put into context they're more simply more people in the ocean than ever before\nWe've looked at it from the human point of view that sauce homo sapiens\nAnd well we're now going to turn when we come back from the shock point of view what how does the sharks the U.S why the sharks in California particularly close in and what is it changing pattern does climate change matter here does El Nino matter here I'm speaking with\nA ... but Dr professor Chris Lowe he's the director of the shark lab California State University in Long Beach I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\n\nIn baseball the mark of a good thing when at home and play five hundred on the road\nThe mark of a great team is that you went on the road the Boston Red Sox not only be Houston Astros in their own stadium\nThey defeated the best pitcher in baseball Justin ... the Boston Red Sox are a great team you can be a great team at home or on the road with balance of nature's fruits and veggies\nBalance of nature provides real nutrition of over ten servings of thirty one different fruits and vegetables per day sounds of nature's fruits and veggies help boost the immune system over seven hundred and twenty percent balance of nature as one hundred percent all natural whole fruits and vegetables no synthetic extracts are filling the balance of nature provides health coverage of charge the\nGuy who was any questions you\nYou can check out all of their testimony that balance of nature dot com\nTake steps give yourself better overall health besides\nCalling now eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one that's eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one\nBalance of nature dot com [noise]\nTo let them know you heard it\nBy using discount coach John J.

short of declaring China a currency manipulator in a semi annual foreign exchange report speaking with Bloomberg former U.S trade representative Wendy Cutler says report isn't really that surprising\nIn some ways China dodged a bullet with this report on their trash rain down and then making clear that they're going to closely monitor China's currency practices um that there's a lot of other tension in this relationship\nFor more on this story we're joined now by Sarah McGregor Bloomberg News economic policy team leaders using our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studios in Washington\nAnd Sarah ... against the decision was not the that's surprising but it does contrast sharply with the president's ah comments about China and its currency was treasury at a critical of China at all in this report [noise]\nAbsolutely said this report that comes out twice a year is based on specific criteria and it looks\nYou know it looks at an all the current season a major trading partners with us from around the world not just China and tries to sum up whether there any countries manipulating their currency so it's it's pretty hard for the treasury to come out and said that uh countries in the ... later if it doesn't meet the specific criteria\nAnd so it wasn't a big surprise that China wasn't named him manipulator of course there was some language in the report as you just said that that sort of a you know gave the U.S ah some leeway to to keep looking at China's currency and saying you know what we still got our eye on you China if you if you try and gain your currency for a trade advantage\nIn the next report six months from now we might we might that change change our minds and so\nYou know I think with these reports we really have to be the treasury has to be careful it's and you know it's a legislation that that is put this given them the power to make these reports they really need to be sort of scientific about how they calculate\nOn an unnamed these countries manipulators and of course president Donald Trump ... can can just sort of see what he wants and if it's a popular message you know it might bring it might bring any ways with people who support him\nHad they been able to find a way to label China a currency manipulator is that something that would have impact in say\nThe currency markets sentiment in the global impact would would that be a factor in their decision making what will this do to the currency markets enemy\nI think by naming China a currency manipulator that would have probably sort of added to the weakness to the Senate right now in emerging markets which are already being hit by interest rate hikes in the in the developing world\nAnd so in in the U.S and so I think you know by by not naming them and then if you later it is it is a good thing for emerging markets China's economy has been a little bit weaker this year the one is weaker um it is down a little bit so I think\nYou know this is a good sign it for the markets there and I think that um the fact that the treasury is sort of rising and brought the political fray is also heartening of course in the U.S right now we feel pretty big politicized they shouldn't have a lot of issues right now and I think\nOr they did pay a tax on it but it was a much lower than a than a Twenty one percent corporate rate it was a downy around fifty depending on the type of asked it was about eight percent or about Fifteen Percent\nSo what are the numbers on actual inversions these days\nVery very low um you know I talked to one advisor who was on basically helped investors pick a companies that would be a good candidates for inversions he's I haven't got a call on on anyone looking for that in a year\nUm and and there's and there's a couple of reasons for that is one is that there have been trying to be regulations as well as his law that have made it a lot harder there's also been a lot of scrutiny it's very politically unpopular to be seen as leading the country you know Obama called it unpatriotic\nA Trump has also railed against these is sort of a scene as a as a ... a bipartisan seen as a bad thing when when U.S companies leave the u._s.\nUm but by doing this sort of you know just shifting of the the intellectual property they're able to gain a lot of the benefits but you don't really have to disclose it on the on the filings I you you don't have to say where things are you know for for companies like Facebook we know less than five percent of weather intellectual property a story\nNo are there limits of this financial only or are there political benefits for example\nYou know there is it it's certainly you know more beneficial to do this then to to invert um you know to to go through a corporate and version and um but they're mostly financial I mean you look and you are you the sort of it doesn't really matter companies can you can sort of sending where this is their digital products sort of a you know a product of a of the Internet era\nUm and you know there are also are able to have teams are around the world scattered a little bit you know Singapore is very popular or in Asia or so they are able to to kind of diversify their workforce a little bit\nOf any companies actually unwound their versions reverse them jobs and operations back as the president said the most so\nWe've kind of isolated examples of you know factories coming back or or you know some you know some folks are saying they are seeing a little bit of IP shifting back on but\nBy and large no a part of it is it's uncertainty and they see 'em Democrats could be coming and taking control of Congress they don't know if all of a lot of this law will be unwound so everyone is is kind of sitting tight going with with business as usual are not anticipating that um that you know that that that this tax law will will stay a fully intact for forever\nSo do we know of just how popular this IP strategy is so much a intellectual property that the company's hold overseas\nWe don't know um I mean it's it's billions and billions of dollars a companies don't have to disclose where where things are kept on we have a some clues are based on sort of where their advisors are located where they have um\nWhere they're booking their profits um and also a based on what they what they what they said but you know you see in in Ireland doesn't really been the the place that everyone likes to go on and their economy has really just boom from it you know their internal government reports are saying that you know they've had\nA you know billions and billions of dollars come in and it it's really actually kind of a mess up their GDP numbers they had some big spike a couple of years ago just because of all these are American companies bringing bringing her IP to Ireland\nI assume but obviously some of many American companies are are probably winners and sexual ... have they have a uh in the back to the question from Bob about the politics of this or are we hearing any of them you know singing the praises of lower tax rates for the U.S and\nSay this is great and supported the president giving him praise\nSo we have seen um corporate America you know universally loved the slower Twenty one percent rate particularly they can get their their us profits tax lower as well as keep some of these foreign profits also tax lower\nThat's a huge when we're still everyone's a little bit up having to wait and see mode um many most if not all companies don't really know what their tax bill will be offered this year because we're still rating on a ton of regulations from the Treasury Department\nSo there's some key questions unanswered there's a lot of changes particularly the international side\nThat companies really just can't even begin to calculate what their what their tax bill will be so I think in a couple of months we'll know more and then we'll kind of see a ... weather who the real winters are\nAnd the irony in all of us use would apparently this was one topic that President Trump can agree\nOn with former President Obama\nYes it's a it's really um interesting kind of how politically unpopular these moves a worthy corporate inversions no companies still did it um you know Pfizer attempted one I'd ultimately failed um after the Treasury Department stepped in and initiate some regulations but despite all of this you could it really shows you a kind of how much money companies were able to save\nA on this by really kind of making a both Republicans and Democrats ...\n... that's Bloomberg News reporter

what\nResearch shows there's a connection between the weather and gun violence and the effects are significant here with this story info tracks really Mickey really thank you Chris\nWe're talking with Jeff Asher he's a nationally recognized crime analyst based in New Orleans suggest your research has shown a pretty clear connection between crime and the weather it's only common sense that there would be less crime on a frigid winter day versus warm summer day but there's more to it than that\nRight well I looked at specifically gun violence trying to track shooting based on what the lower high temperature wise from the and that way\nAnd what it shows is as you say not surprisingly when it's really cold there are fewer shooting and when it's warmer there are more shooting than we tend to associate this change as oh in the summer gets hot everyone goes outside and there's lots of gun violence but\nI think the real way to look at it is when it's cold\nPeople essentially have less shooting than there is less gun violence\nIt's not so much a when it's hot pattern but much more effective when it's cold a couple of city Philadelphia and ...\nA pattern but much more effective when it's cold a couple of cities Philadelphia and Baltimore had data that allowed you to separate whether or not a victim was inside or outside and when it showed is that it doesn't matter what the temperature is\nThe number of shooting victims that are inside is going to stay the same and both of those cities but a number of shooting victims that are outside can as much as double or triple and these cities when it say eighty five or Ninety degrees versus when at twenty degrees\nUnderstanding you also found that these weather related swings and crime are more pronounced in northern cities\nOr right and that goes back to the fact that it's more reliant on cold so in a city like Los Angeles or New Orleans\nWhere it rarely gets cold enough in the fifties and forties and thirties to really affect your shooting patterns you might have five or ten days a year\nWhere you're going to have actual cold weather whereas if you're looking at Chicago or Detroit or Baltimore you're looking at many many many many more days per year that's actually cold and so you may see an effect if there are more days where it's colder and a particular year\nYou may have you know five to seven days in New Orleans whereas in Chicago you may have Seventy ten Ninety Days and that's a huge difference because that's twenty more days of fewer shootings versus one or two more days if you were shooting the New Orleans\nSo you found is consumed in every major city or where there is some outliers maybe the book the trend\nWell it was consistent in every city I looked at except for San Francisco and San Francisco was largely due to the fact that it's never gets hot or never gets cold in San Francisco every other city\nThe pattern was there to some degree and it was stronger in the northern cities it was almost identical in cities like Detroit Philadelphia in Chicago\nI knew the bulk of these violent crime statistics come from major cities and I'm sure the bulk of the shootings overall are in these cities but do you think whether couldn't even be a factor in lower crime areas maybe rural areas\nAbsolutely I think it would be a factor in pretty much everywhere that it's colder longer or hotter longer that compared\nThe murder count and every city that were the twenty most murderous cities in the country in two thousand fourteen versus their murder counts in two thousand sixteen and all twenty cities had more murders and two dozen fourteen than in two thousand sixteen\nEighteen of them had fewer cold days and Eighteen of them had for hot days and so it's not a one hundred percent causation but I think that you could build a strong argument that weather and the increase in the national temperature\nProbably had some effect on the increase in murder between two thousand fourteen and she's sixteen I wouldn't argue that it's\nThe main driver but they're certainly does appear to be evidence that it could be a driver\nAnd one would expect that in places like rural America where you might only have a handful of shooting victims it may only mean if you've got or hot weather and they only need one more shooting victim per year but\nThey're Eighteen thousand agencies that report data to the FBI and the uniformed crime report so if you've only got one or two more shooting victims here one or two more shooting victims tier one or two more murder victims here it adds up over the course of Eighteen thousand agencies\nIn a place like Chicago you may have fifty more shooting victims over the course of the year if it's hotter versus if it's colder in a smaller place in America you may only have a handful more\nBut nationally when you put it all together I think it adds up\nJeff what do you think is behind this trend I'm sure you have some theories in mind\nWell I think theories is the operative word here because I don't know that there's a definitive explanation and there's nothing in the data that necessarily shout one explanation\nI Do think that it's plausible that a little bit of the explanation is temperatures player\nI've never found that to be the most compelling explanation but some of the experts I talked to him to think that that is at least plausible I think just the general availability of people outside when it's hot out\nPeople go outside and they spend time on their porch and they hang out and they play basketball and it's much harder to find a shooting victim if everyone's inside avoiding the twenty degree snowy weather\nOne of the explanations is also that when it gets warm enough\nPeople who may not have air conditioning find it to be a more pleasant experience to be outside and to be hanging out and to not be hot sitting inside so one of the economists I talked to pointed to a paper that said that air conditioning can be a significant factor in determining and something like this\nAnd one would think that the same underprivileged communities that would have difficulty with air conditioning and having that widely available would also be the types of communities that are affected strongly facts I\nSuggest what are your thoughts on the future regarding climate change and the crime rate\nBut obviously climate change is a concern issue for lots of reasons\nI think crime is just another reason why climate change can be incredibly concerning for me I think the major takeaway from this is that we're always looking to find explanations for why the murder rate rose so significantly between twenty fourteen and twenty six teams and there have been tons of theories thrown out there\nAnd I think the one that staring us right in the faces that it was just warmer and twenty Fifteen and twenty sixty and then it was in twenty fourteen and if whether can have a major impact\nThat can help us to understand why murder rows and I don't want to say not panic or not celebrate one murder goes up and down just because of the weather but the more we understand what Dr gun violence in our cities and changes and gun violence in our cities the better we can understand what we're doing against it\nJeff Asher the crime analyst based in New Orleans do have a website where people can learn more\nI have

Republican majority stand in the United States Senate\nIf you look at the polling that you saw this past week it looks like the trends have been that well earlier there was some thought that the Democrats would take to send it back it looks like the Republicans will keep the Senate right now there's a majority fifty one to forty nine\nBut it looks like not only would keep the Senate but there are some races that make you think that made them actually pick up a couple of seats in the Senate\nAnd interesting trends there especially in red states like Texas in Tennessee where you see the Republican candidates gaining the advantage\nOf about a month to six to eight weeks ago does races were actually close based on the polling\nAnd now the Republican candidates in both those races or Ted Cruz the incumbent senator Republican senator in Texas\nAnd Marsha Blackburn congresswoman from Tennessee up for the open seat to replace Senator Bob Corker ... have taken a significant leads eight to nine to ten points and they look like they are going to based on the polling\nOr what it's worth a have taken significant leads in both those states and so there was some concern about Republicans they could lose two seats that were ... concedes the Democrats looks like they're going to hold those seats\nIs this a case of Republicans coming home as you get closer to the elections\nI think so and you know we can't discount what happened with the the the confirmation hearings for judge Kavanaugh as that's part of the fact because this looks like this has happened in the past six weeks\nTwo weeks to the election a lot can happen but it looks like as we have gotten closer to the election Republican voters or are expressing where they're going to head and some of the independence that were kind of in the middle have in those two states turning towards the Republicans\nIs your sense that the fight over now justice Brett Kavanaugh got a lot of Republican voters in the game or as perhaps over the summer there was um maybe they were feeling a little more complacent\n[noise] I think so in those states where Donald Trump won in twenty sixteen uh like Texas like um [noise] Tennessee you have seen that trend now\nIn states that are more ... more a democratic um it looks like the Democrats are doing well but there are those states\nThat are kind of the purple states the ones in the middle that really on a lecture night the states I Would really watch\nOr Indiana and Missouri where those races have been very close you've got the two Democratic incumbent senators Claire McCaskill in Missouri Joe Donnelly in Indiana and those races are neck and neck and so\nIf and they both voted against the confirmation for Brett Kavanaugh\nSo if the seats go Republican and you lose two incumbent Democrat sinners and that's why you could see the Republicans not only keep\nThe majority in the Senate but actually maybe pick up her seat or two so there's a lot of races that night uh Montana's on the table or a West Virginia I'm Nevada and Arizona we're\nTwo seats that the Democrats thought they could pick up but it since the the Kavanaugh hearings it looks like the Republicans have picked up stained incumbent\nA Heller center Heller in Nevada and then the open seat to replace Jeff like in Arizona it looks like the Republican voters are trending Republican way so it looks like the Senate the Republicans are going to keep those two seats as well\nOn the Senate side as things look now the the map favors Republican\nAnd one other state we do need to talk about is North Dakota\nIncumbent Democrat Senator there\nShe is down by in some polls tend to twelve point so that looks like that will definitely be a flip from a Democrat to Republican so if nothing else if everything is involved and comments when and everything kind of shakes out\nA ... it looks like there will be at least one blip from a Democrat or Republican in North Dakota and the senator there she voted against a Brett Kavanaugh and since then it went from being a very close race where she was ahead to she is down by ten to twelve point so that looks like North Dakota we'll flip\nI'm from a Democrat to Republican Senate now that is in the sit\nOn the house side that we know that the generic polls favors Democrats but we also know that these races are fault district by district\nAnd or is it going to boil down to a a turnout game and and if so how do you see the parties going ah to energize their respective bases well\nThere is no question that um it the Democrats have looked like they have\nThe favorites to win the house which should not be of any surprise because if you always look at\nA mid term election after a president is elected usually the party of the president loses seats in Congress no question about it you look ... back the past hundred years that has been the trend that has been the history of this country so\nThat has been the trend that has been the history of this country so if the Democrats were to win the house back from the Republicans that should not surprised anybody that's kind of what the American public does\nNow since the I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nHearings you have seen some movement there the Democrats seats have gotten more Democrat Republican seats has gotten more Republican so as we watch these very close races it is a matter of turn out what's going to happen now Donald Trump the president is campaigning across the country hitting states like North Dakota\nI'm Ohio a Montana Arizona campaigning for Republican Congress I'm\nA congressional leaders in across the country trying to keep those seats but um if not and then you could end up seeing a Nancy Pelosi back in this in the speaker's chair\nAnd uh so it'll be a very contentious two years\nWell it seems as though Democrats have had an agent enthusiasm for a lot of this cycle then as we mentioned post ... we saw the Republican base get energized do you see that energy lasting through the election\nWell they certainly were energized during the hearings I think the the way those hearings uh what happened I'm\nReally got Republicans those who are more conservative those who may be in a more from maybe the moderate Republicans from the northeast all got together and said and got behind\nThe confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh of United States Supreme Court so it it really became a unifying force for the Republican Party and in that unifying force everybody got together and said we need to go out and elect Republicans for both the Senate and the house\nSo I Do agree or when you when you look back on election day if you see some of the state seats where Republicans when I think you can um\nDefinitely put some of it on what happened with the capital herons and and they attempt to block that nomination by the Democrats\nHere in Alabama the race for governor tops the ballot and polls show the incumbent Kay Ivey with a big lead over Democrat Walt Maddox IVs approval rating remains high and obviously this race playing out will\nYou know this past year there have been several polls that show that nationally she is the a K Abby's the third most popular governor in her state in the country so\n... you look around the state you you look at the Republican primary where she won pretty soundly\nAnd had a very good um turn out there\nI think it carries over to the to the the general election and you look at some of these uh counties around the state where she just one significantly and I think on election night you'll see some counties where she carries\nBy you know Seventy five percent eighty percent I don't think that's going to change I'm a ... no matter what Walt Maddox does and the next two weeks I think I don't think that he can catch up with with Kay Ivey again she had a strong challengers some really good candidates\nAnd the Republican primary um who I'm challenged her in and she won and I don't see that changing in a red state like Alabama in November\nYou see a strong showing by ivy helping other Republicans in the down ballot races now I really think ah everybody's going to look at each candidate individually so while nationally you do have some\nUh ... go to um a coat tails from the president\nUm and some of these national races I think in Alabama I really do think that everybody looks at each candidate on an individual basis or they may vote Republican not necessarily because we're going to support K Avi but you know this is the candidate they want to get behind\nWashington

elected\nI don't know how many people when they don't have answers but you know they describe me for ... you know\nYou know she's up there you know it's like Kermit the frog and I'm like you know this this is a lot to do it\nRight you know and and and where it's like it's like Chicago there there's going to they're just going to let that happen in and just pay back like it's not happening\nWhile you know one thing one thing that is a definite and and I and I can't say no and and they are whether it's almost like a certain black black neighborhoods are not the thing that my but I can only speak from what I Know it's like you know ... ... people let's say is bad as it can get\nTo run you out and then they come in and they said the rain and turn everything around like man while it didn't look like this before we live but then again they could still like that why you got to live there you have to change in leadership\nAnd their situation and not going to do that that I mean liberals like this\nIn order to pass the minority liver damage from the role that you know\nYou know this is how we do we have to live this way we have to be this way and we just had access to you know you have to have what we call a black rabbit and the ... syndrome so\n[laughter] you know we'll speaking of uh minorities there's something that I wanted to get your opinion on 'em\nSo recently you know we heard a while back about Rachel Dolezal the white woman who said that she said that she was black and\nAnd work your way up through using that to get a higher up in the end up Lacey pee wee add Elizabeth Warren who recently just took her DNA tests to find out she has one one thousand twenty fourth a Native American so um I mean a better or rock is probably more more\nA Native American and she is but better or cause another one who's claiming to be Hispanic even though he's a he's he's probably\nZero point one three six percent white the same as his a blood alcohol level when he got his DUI [noise] but um\n[laughter] but but it was so [laughter]\nBut um but but you know so it already [laughter]\nIf there is everyone was for a while ago we ever heard it for a while ago we just heard about white privilege by privilege and all this white privilege and white privilege and white privilege my privilege and there's so much white privilege that how come we have\nThree or why individuals using minorities to perjure themselves to say they're minorities why why don't they just use the white privilege to present themselves\n\nWell see that the you know we're we're on a little psychology and it's pretty much the reverse psychology I mean how can you say about ... how can you always talking to my door where I'm going like oh so it's the talk talk about a white privilege and\nYou know you you're a black entertainment television or mostly white in saving the television um you have oh you you're trying to make black colleges\nAll black you got to make them as black as you can but I Wonder if it came out with white college to white college football\nOr um to bite the white entertainment networks so you know when people sit up and they talk about this is talk about black and white privilege white privilege I mean\nYou know it all goes back to 'em\nAll goes back to the people that they've been discriminated against the national discourage me black folks discriminate against each other\nOn trade show last Hinojosa disturbing is race racism and all races\nAnd it just like this thing about trying to make white folks feel it you know feel bad for being white or this or that you know I I don't go along with that I mean I I I can say here for about a half hour and I can get it probably my mom probably are a lot of people that I Know that that's conservative that grew up in in in the hood\nAnd we can tell you exactly how these people are trying to play reversed tried every burst on on the reverse psychology to try and make people feel like they owe them something when it when the likelihood is you know ... you gotta clean up your race first we want to talk about this or that white privilege I don't go along with that that's\nThat's a that's a lot of ... or ... or you were\nWhen you are you yeah [laughter] me neither do I I don't I've never felt that I've been benefited from it I mean I may have I don't know uh no one's ever come up to me and said by the way we're going to do this for you because you're white no one has ever said that to me\nSo I Do not know if I've ever actually Ben benefited from or if either of actually benefited from white privilege but it seems to me that that that the the white privilege is going on here is that these is that the Democrats are using\nTheir white privilege to take advantage of minorities by saying that they are one of them\nSo it seems to me that we're trying to say oh I Want to you so you should vote for me as opposed to saying hey I'm who I Am so they're trying to be someone they're not to try to to try to trick those into believing that they should be voting for them\nIt can happen when you're dealing with people that anger\nThey're or they're driven by race or whatever like that I mean it's always like that especially around mid term my last election any kind of election is always like that and that's what the problem that a lot of problems that we have the right and we were what the what the Republican Party is it is that they they what they do they stay on a card\nFor ... or whatever and then they go back and they want black black for the vote for them\nInstead of the ... the during the things that they see the liberals dawn ... the one thing that I Can't say the liberals are just as back was ever\nBut the thing of it is it that their strategy about getting young voter people weren't ball and also to understand about the bowling or the or the correct correct way to vote vote on merit not on race or color or race or or what they do their trendy\nAnd that's where that's where I'm not part of the movement a grassroots movement is focusing on things like that and said that focus on on the politics of it you get to the education part of it so people don't get tricked like this for another generation but we're already Fifteen\nTwenty years behind the eight ball we got a lot of work ahead of us and they'll probably go on and you know long after court ... court documents are\nYou going to be a long long outdoor gone but you know we're going to take a quick break when we come back we're still going to have core junk and with us we're going to be talking a little bit about some other

I Do you know I'll tell you what I'm ... you know I learned recently that over twenty five percent of Americans have some type of allergies and you know you get in your home and are so many people have really done well to insulate their home and seal up the ... they're home because it does save you a lot of money you\nKnow every day of the year winter and summer a but it also traps a lot of contaminants in there including the so the best way for you to help out on your allergies just keep the dust at bay dusted made up of things like um\nYou know skin cells and pet dandruff it's also kind of gross anyway if you think about it I mean dust mites feed on those particles they thrive on linens and blankets so it really need to wash those items very often in very hot water replace pillows regularly or cover them with a anti allergic\nCover and uh the the the ... men make sure you're really does frequently replace the air filter for your heating\nAnd cooling system regularly these things cost you almost nothing but a little bit of time if you want to go even further you might consider replacing any carpet in your home with hard surface flooring material boy I'll tell you this is something that um I've seen so popular with the luxury of vinyl\nPlanks that uh we have installed and uh I'll tell you what we had a lot of great videos at today's home under dot com on

to\nPut on the knee pads and get on the floor and insult let yourself it is a very easy way of completely change in your room and as we're talking about here it gets rid of a little bit more of that carpet because no matter\nHow much you vacuum carpet harbors more dust that are regularly mop floor so it's a lot of different ways that you can get rid of that dust around your home and don't underestimate the importance of having that proper air filter in changing it on a regular basis a lot of information Whitey known yet today's home under dot com\nAnd this little um it it um indoor air quality tip brought to you by her own\nNew tone or at right now let's see if we can um\nCan get right to the phones Evelyn is in Washington state Evelyn welcome to the ... days from a radio show\nThank you for having a\nGood what's going on at your house here in Washington\n[laughter] I have a problem really oh wow it's a lot more than I've ever noticed in any of my own and I've been in about five or six calls uh-huh it's accumulating in a um carpet or in the bath\nAnd it was all over the surface it's all over throughout the house now it's an unusual\nLarger mouth while our our our listeners across the country are going to think we stacked these calls up here but I was just talking about ah this very thing well let me ask you about your house um is it up on piers got across based underneath\nWe do have a space it houses it's um it's actually carved into ill part of it and we do have a cross based however if we can walk\nA underneath that they actually had and I actually went under there today went in today\nOkay so so you have a fair amount of space there and I'm now do you have any plastic on the ground\nIs some plastic however I notice that there are some areas where it uncovered\nOkay because you know what happens so often I'm is when you have\nIt happens with very dry soil as well as wet soil in that\nThat water can migrate up into your home causing moisture mildew problems but along the same type of path you can have a very dusty conditions and what happens is your house some ... let me ask you in a more questions on you have central air and hate system\nWe do okay so so you have a return air system in your home that is pulling air into and through a filter\nAnd then it's being filtered hopefully whale and then going through your duct work system to distribute the heat or the cool throughout the entire house\nSo that creates a pressure that that that a suction that's pulling from all areas of your home matter of fact a lot of people are surprised to know that every cubic foot of air in your home\nPasses through that filter\nTwo to three times per hour\nThink about think about that so I Am a cubic foot all this space all this air you have is going through that one little bitty innocent filter two or three times an hour now but it's also because of the pressure if that duck or if like your return air\nIs not steal completely under the house or in the attic or wherever then it's polling whatever it can grab\nInto the duck or and spread it all throughout your house so that's one of the first line of defense is first of all make sure you have a good quality electric static filter costs you twelve to Fifteen bucks\nSure you're changing that at least two to three or at least every two to three months and okay and and and and then\nReally need to inspect that um have a air conditioning guy tell them what you're concerned about tell them that I mentioned that you might have some dust this being pulled into the system and can they please make sure that it's the old properly\nBecause I'll bet that's what's causing the distribution of dust and and that political ration of dust\nThroughout the entire area that's usually what makes that happen\nOkay okay I can we do have it in ... uh annually I Will ask\nThat I mean I really do think that's probably the case there and then like I say that filter or will make a big difference in trying to cut it down but if there's a branch or a leak somewhere else and what they called the ...\nArea of the air conditioning system that so that filter won't help you at all but a check that out have them check it out thoroughly and I'll bet you'll be able to cut down on your dusting time\nOh okay [laughter] All right [laughter] do they fear ...\nEvelyn thanks so much for being with us here today so I Wonder if we can help you any other way just let us know\nOkay thank you very much appreciate\nAll right I pleasure wow we're talking about um indoor air quality and then we have an email and we have a lot of color they're talking about the same thing uh October is indoor air quality month\nAnd it just so happens that we got bill in there so people are concerned about it because as the weather gets cooler we're going to spend more time inside and it's going to be more important that we make sure that air were breathing inside is as\nAs as good as it possibly

Rhode Island today and I'm here hanging with our friends from this old house they've invited me to be a part of the final day of production\nHere and James now as a complete and it really unusual house they've taken a one hundred euro seaside house that was originally built was probably never intended for anything other than summer residency they bolted on a brand new addition and they've made this entire structure so energy and fishing\nIs now known as a net zero house which means is designed to create the total amount of energy it needs to operate so coming up this hour we're going to get all the details on that project straight from the ... team\nIncluding Kevin O'Connor and Roger cooked plus\nNorm ... will be by to talk about a very special mouse to reach by very few programs\nBecause this is these forty in season of this old house so let's get to it to get things off I'm very pleased to welcome a great friend of the money pit Kevin OConnor welcome Kevin and I mean that figuratively and literally because not only are you are now but you've been a friend too many homeowners now for\nMany many years in your role as host and congratulations on the forty a season at this old house while yeah\nAnd congratulations on the forty a season at this old house while\nYeah season forty forty years it's something we're very proud of his you know I Can't take any credit for that I've only been doing it for the last Fifteen or the other boys are twenty five years ahead of me on that but it's a testament to\nWhat norm Roger Richard in time he started back in Nineteen Seventy nine um that it's still going that it's still popular that we're still doing beautiful building like this and we're taking it for a little bit of a victory lap are proud of it absolutely\nSo tell us about this area of Jamestown now we're kind of right across the river from Newport which is famous for mansions and cliff walks is this where you move if your name wasn't Vanderbilt\n[laughter] I'm not sure it's an island I'm right in there against it sounds so to the west of us at the mainland of Rhode Island and into the east of us as you say is the peninsula of Newport where all the mansions are all the sailing\nOr it's a smaller island community back in the day people had to take the ferry to go to school for the year to the mainland\nWe're now connected by bridges but it's always been sort of you know one step removed from the hubbub of Newport for us it's the whole of architect is also a homeowner right who's fall in love with the area they had been vacationing here for many years and he decided no\nThis is where we want to raise our kids and we went to live and so that is what has sort of started this project to begin with\nNow this is a net zero project and that probably had a lot of challenges behind you took a very old building and on an addition and significantly increase the space of it I had to bring those together and are not as a trick when it came to the energy efficient\nIt next year has two components to you've got to make your own energy and we do that with solar panels and that's kind of new beautiful technology but you also have to try to reduce the load that you use in the house right and as you know these old houses the original when he was built in the Nineteen twenties um it leak like a sieve\nGrill near the back door a there is the barn or that they're in and out of the new projects it's a it's a family of of of\nAh constructors right this ... stuff yeah they definitely bills yeah\nSo we created a working yard off that garage in off the kitchen with a a with an old flat open space a little area of of paving little vegetable garden and there's a sliding door between the garage in this open space so it's kind of the overflow workspace\nSo and so it's kind of like I'm bringing the indoors out in the outdoors in English and airy space where just very comfortable moving from one zones and the next stage Zachary exactly that's where the design comes in in his side from the design\nNow you've got to actually plan the physical elements actually perform what that intent is yes oh yes\nSo we gave them both are in an area of heart surfers in an area of grass a design defense or this come back we're all of this space put up a hedge between the house\nAnd the working yard which takes out some of the view of the mess that might be there in the back yard right out of the out of the kitchen windows ... uh and then that's also the circulation space in the back into the back back yard a which is a larger grassy area for their two young boys to get out and do it\nYoung boys do no if folks are listening to this day game you know what process show I go through if\nI Want to improve my backyard space what kind of chips would you give them to kind of get to just aren't as well as what you mentioned before about relating the inside of the outside is vitally important okay so you can have a great space on saying that you can't get to it\nIt doesn't do a lot of good right [laughter] and and you want to go inside and look out all the windows you know because you're going to live in a in this New England\nWe live inside quite a lot of the time but a lot of views out the windows are just as important as the views of the house or the views of open space\nAnd then to zone those different areas as they relate to the house and then as they relate to the outside property lines we don't really think of the outside in the room split sense it is ... and in the smaller the house the more useful those rooms are more important they are right\nIf you got a ... acre lot you have a house in ... on and you know everything kinda bleeds out\nWhen you have a small house like this those outside edge has become more defined and they become more integrated into the living in the house\nSo all really important things to do keep in mind if you're you know if you just completed\nThe summer and you're thinking about now so I'm gonna start planning for next year you got about six or eight months now and start staring at those windows and thinking about spaces and you know really living through your head\n... may be making a paper model of it I always just because people sometimes can't imagine space ... sack but now's the time to do that and that's great information so congratulations on a well\nDone projects here Tom Ryan landscape architect on this project thank you so much for stopping by the money ... great thank you and you'll find this old house and asked us little house on your local PBS stations plus for more details in behind the scenes photos is it this little house dot com or follow at this little house on Twitter and Facebook and ...\nWage Jamestown well as you heard there are many many things\nTake ... wage Jamestown well\nAs you heard there are many many things about this home that are special and that includes the lawn there's actually a very unique type of\nTurf called micro clover you're with us to talk about that is this old house landscaping contractor Roger Cook and pat Hogan with sub go walk them guys welcome so this is a house where the environment is really at the forefront and you've chosen a type of Turks here\nThat is extremely sustainable and pretty much defines a environmental sensibility for for a landscaping let's talk about it you call it micro clover what is\nThe micro clover is just what it is it's a clover but it's not like the Dutch clover right minimally flowering non colonizing clover okay that we've mixed in with a call to ask you mix and is very trout tolerant\nThe clover takes the atmosphere nitrogen converted into nitrogen that the grass\nCan use so you don't need to fertilize it Roger when it comes to fertilizing and getting the the lawn chemicals just write that something trips a lot of people up right\nWhere we spend a lot of time on our lawns trying to get 'em just right and usually it's in the past it's always been a bluegrass lawn right bluegrass lawn so a lot of water and a lot of feed and then you go to spray for weeds and bugs and everything else\nSo this is the type of turf if you see a lot of commercial is it unusual to put it in a residents well we just started growing this in the past few years in right so it's something that's going on we see is the future is going to keep going ...\nHow does it stand up in terms of like wear and tear I mean this house has has two kids are growing up in it you know the top of that\nIt's tough for that at the idea house a couple of weeks ago here for this old house so that quite a bit of traffic across that lawn and no I was back there last week with the professor from Penn State that it doesn't research on this stuff look gorgeous use a very happy\nTo see so when you put down a side Roger as opposed to you know growing one from scratch once the prepping ball\nThat I think it's the same as we've always been doing right we take what soil is here and we rotor Tiller scare and losing it all All right so that the roots that are coming in can get down into a tank of themselves who get whatever moisture Zia than we find greed will ... will put in some lime if it needs it and then you see this on\nNow we're in the midst of a parental rainstorm right now I gather you doctors to LSU irrigation today but does it take the same amount of water or less or more than you were the traditional long we'd get\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it is does not use a lot a lot of water in the middle yeah we are in fact we have to educate people who are not\nWatering so much that's right yeah at the idea house I've already had to contact the irrigation contractor and say shut the water off the I had enough\n[noise] so how can you add this to an existing longer do you always have to start from scratch with San I think with the micro ... you can over seated into it\nBut I Would say wouldn't want to do it into a bluegrass lawn because that's not really a drought tolerant or more than a century right correct and that's just not because they're not going to get along those two types right yeah we've\nPut it in with the tall fast you that's more drought tolerant though this is a harsh environment because it's right here on the coast I guess they're appropriate products for a seaside community Oh yes it is a lot salts and all that it's actually more of\nSalt resistance been blue grass is qualified I Love about this old house I mean you know you were things that you just wouldn't imagine\nReally exist I mean the fact that there's\nThis very specialized type of side that has all these benefits to it\nIs is so cool and and you guys\nAlways sort of pushing the envelope and coming up with this stuff for projects like that it just you know it just keeps fashioning the audience that's probably why they're around for for forty years now is the end of the forty a season so congratulations on all the good work you put into that Roger bank some around here\nYeah well you talk about pushing the envelope pushed to hide in the wrong direction by you know well\nYou guys have done a great job with his house and and

lots of wiring that had outlived its usefulness including ... would have been probably the original wiring for one hundred your home it's a type called not into\nSo with us to talk about the safety of all that old wiring and what needs to be done with it as electrician been Giles welcome Ben Adler you we're good thanks for stopping by the money to this is a interesting area lots of lots of history right here\nLots of all homes and would you agree that ... it was probably the first sort of ... than as these buildings yeah for\nSure that was the first modern type of wiring that could be afforded by your average person it wasn't a steel pipe installation or something that was highly labor intensive to install so it was pretty widely used in the early Nineteen hundreds as one of the first real residential methods of wiring\nIt's interesting for those that are unfamiliar we're not going to we're actually talking about real knobs and real too\nFor those that are unfamiliar with not been too We're actually talking about real knobs and real to cheer when it was run through beams you drill hole and it looks like a ceramic tube through it\nTo sort of inflate the wire from the wood and then when it went perils of the themes that would be strung on these ceramic knobs and it was essentially an air cooled system so air had to circulate around it\nBut then we decided we were going to eat these homes Annette insulation and what happens\nWell it eats up the other thing I think that happens to a lot in these older homes as you know when the whole er originally built designed they weren't designed for things like vacuum cleaners dishwashers air conditioners all these modern appliances that we have today\nAnd all of those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so\nWhat you get is people kind of tagging new wiring onto the old system in unsafe way race and using it incorrectly or an again those systems were never intended to carry those kind of loads coupled with horror installation techniques of newer wiring and the and the increased loads of the homes it just creates some dangerous situations but\nThe original installation the way that it was intended to be used was actually not a bad one right is fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now but this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two that were still active\nOh yeah there were definitely most of the house had some now than to than it there were a lot of things tapped off of that and I'm into just like I just said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it work with the existing system\nI'm so it was definitely a relatively dangerous situation in this house you know the things that definitely needed to be taken back to zero and start over\nTheir real education and I understand that you spent quite a bit of time working with The Apprentice is for the season Mary Smith and Kevin Barker how'd they do\nAll those guys are great

tired of progressing towards that skilled trades men type of\nPosition and Mary was just awesome you know really I only got to work with her a few times but she definitely had a great attitude and willing to work hard wanted to learn loves what she does so those types of people are always fun to be around\nSo they were brought on this show basically as an example of what we eat in this country which is young people that are learning skilled trades do you think they were good ... led mission\nOh for sure yeah you know they both love what they do they both loved to learn about what they do so that's a great start you know you can teach a lot of things but you can't teach work ethic are passions so those guys are both great for that\nTalking to bend drowsy the electrician on this project in

Taliban and all that and then I I sit there for men and of course my daughter here's me inside the and the living room goes you okay because you know two hundred and Seventy pounds fallen is is this pretty heavy\nAnd ah why was it now but I was just roll with a friend but um they we got to talking about things and all that we finished up and then I ... I told her you know listen to the show or the ... own show and\nThen he goes oh really is yeah says WICK out and he goes I said man you've got to in one of the things as funny as refrigerators I said are you now you've got a fridge right or that Scott screen on the outside and you can call up recipes are and bother didn't you tell me that that if your program it ride or whatever then as you put things in there it scans and tells you what's in there\nThat's exactly right and also tell you if something has been voided in other words if if it's out drywall yeah ... ... plus it's got cameras you could see a way if you're at the grocery store and you forget what's in their cameras up and down in the Philippines scans\nNow by me I got a question or like Dale say he put something in the refrigerator and want to his kids get to meet you can he go back and see who ate it [laughter] I mean\nI got the uh you could put a smart though that's a good idea or there was record\nThat's right and I was missing a chocolate milk last night uh Dale was not happy hour is not happy and that's that purity chocolate milk you know man that's good stuff but so I told the guy and he goes like I said you know all the homes just everything's going automation he goes\nHe said you know what the next refrigerator I'm ... and I go out and he goes the ones that you open the door and get your ice out of the tray no water dispenser on the front and he goes I Want a simple refrigerator 'cause they always break and I go well\nOkay I understand I could do that so uh but the technology bother coming in with what you're talking about the ... and that's part of the smart home technology right\nOh absolutely here and I tell you the thing about these he's a smart thermostat they do save a lot of money I

house from window shades to pet feeders now we control and pet theaters were drops the food\n\nThat too sure that I mean it was a simple push the button or voice command some activities like setting up a lamp to turn on and off at your whim and simply and relatively inexpensive\nSimpler simple and relatively inexpensive others like advance surveillance cameras may require more serious investment of time and money but you know bottom will keep on going on that because that's what was going to talk about this more ... more home but you got to start with what Bob is the smart home hub and

that like Joe said hop over to enjoy the dotcom drop us ally will be glad to catch you up on what you missed but in order to manage yourself\nEspecially especially in the face of challenges and challenging emotions and that's what we're talking about emotional intelligence here you have to be aware of the emotion itself and then you have to be aware of your own natural tendencies\nIt's really easy to explode and take the bait of a good fight\nAnd then than that inflammatory beast of anger when it comes over you but the problem is\nThat we seriously stumped the growth of our emotional intelligence when we give ourselves\nOver two emotions and when we let emotions take the driver's seat and then direct our choices I never did I get [laughter] me either [laughter] I Know and all of a management comes that we're talking to the other people they're the ones we're not as we have 'em knowing where yeah all theoretical through us now\nAre so getting 'em all all of a self

E. N. N. Y. A. N. D.\nJ. O. G. Y. dot com [noise] welcome back to pop parenting is you're just tuning in we are continuing series on helping kids become emotionally\nIntelligent in today's episode we're talking about helping kids develop self management skills and the first segment of today's show we asked questions to help parents identify their own self management skills with human part of the show\nAnd you're just tuning in for any reason and you have to go before the show up as a be sure to head over to Jenny ... dot com and drop us ally and we would gladly hope you catch up on anything that you may have messed\nIn this segment we're going to look at something we're calling the powerful magical pause okay so what are you ... oh cause\nNo there's no maggots [laughter]\nI Do okay so here's how this happened I'm so somebody something happen so let's just say it's it's a person or a thing\nThat happens it could be an it's an incident of some kind and this incident insights a very strong emotion like a anger or stress or fear right and those kind of emotions are are kind of information you can even feel the inflammation how do you feel your face got hot\nI'm your heart might be faster or you might get a headache pretty instantly I can see all of this happening on the inside of you\nThere's this very critical moments where you have a choice this is where the self management comes into play or self control comes into play he's in this one brief moment you have a choice and the choice is to give over to it\nOr to press pause now we're talking about the plaza minute but first we're talking about when you get over to it so you give over to it that's easier ... kind of\nI Know it's easier it's easier in a moment right then it's you know you're that you have to\nDo much harder ones that are I Know I Know I'm not real it back in ... and that's the problem like anger can easily turn into a rage oh yeah fear can turn into panic\nAnd there's so many like that you know like like anger can turn into hatred so many things can when you give that emotion the drivers we'll or the steering wheel and you let them take over\nAnd they will steer you down a dangerous road and then you can't bring it back and I think everyone has experienced this at some point like you get mad and you let the race takeover and now it's like you just can't stop well\nAnd you can't and I tell you for me anyway it's easier to let myself go there it takes so much self control in that split second but the ... the self control comes the hard\nRight and that's and that's kind of what I mean by in some ways it's it's it's easier to to press the pause especially with practice over time because you're when you when you don't give yourself over to his do you feel it rise and you press the pause you actually give yourself the time in the space too\nYou actually give yourself the time in the space to problem solve to get your ... decisions under control and actually there's a few different phases of this that we're going to talk about today okay so you're in this motion you identify\nThat something's happening internally there's a red flag you know what I think you can envision that heat that comes up you like yeah monster trying to come to the surface I over yeah literally possessed you an executive ... monsters right pause right right yeah freeze [laughter]\nUm okay so now in this free is there is the first step of the freeze is\nTo identify what's happening 'cause like you said today judge you knew something was going on in the first moment you weren't exactly aware of what I was right\nOn so you have to ask yourself what is happening here what and why am I feeling this way what's going on once you have a name for it then you can also ask yourself to very important question what do I need in this situation what do I want [laughter] right\nRight what are my needs what do I want what's in other words what does my goal and then the tuition what do I really want to happen next if you're upset with the person then you need to stop for a few minutes and figure out what you want in the connection to this person\nThat's hard to identify it so that's how I just as important otherwise there's going to be no resolve if you don't know what you\nWant you know what sometimes is has has to happen with the person standing right in front of you and your mental brand yes oh yeah two and a cashier is does something horrendously rude and you want to be like really you work at the McDonalds like [laughter] what what is your life like but you know what you\nDon't know their situation and you're going to feel terrible about yourself when you walk out of there and you're going to feel like I was ... that person and why you know I could have taken the high ground I could've but no I had to become this terrible version of myself\nAnd and so what you do in that moment when the person behave that way as you pause in the back of your head and I they're you know bringing you up or whatever you say to yourself to ever do I need to address is what's\nThe best way to address this you know you can you can win a small victory in that and you can say the first thing you can say to yourself as well you you got crap and your crap is getting ready to part my crap but I'm On a ... I'm going to have the victory over you're not on my lap\nRight and sometimes there is an action that's needed if somebody really is inappropriate\nThere are times where you actually do need to speak to a manager you need 'em do medically diplomatically you need to call you need to say in fact I had a situation in Starbucks I won't go into all the details\nBut I had an extremely badly oh like and it and I and I didn't I didn't blow up I actually I actually contacted corporate headquarters\nAnd I found out what the my rights in a situation where I went out to the counter I\nAsked ... as nicely they could because I was mad I said excuse me sorry what's your name\nAnd he told me his name I went back I report is the name and I let them handle it they gave me a fifty dollar gift card but [laughter] but you have to say what your goal and this was years and says as a person you want to have a relationship with if this is someone you love\nIf we confront the situation you've got to remind yourself I Love this person and say what you love about this person because right now they're meaning badly right and you want to confront the person that you love and you want to confront all the good in that person so that's the first part the first part is the identification and that's where you press the pause\nThe next step in the ... is to problem solve so now you have to think about what are your choices in the situation\nUm and again you're going to walk your kids do this you're going to teach your children how to do this to when they're angry and you can see the anger coming up you're going to intervene and you're going to say OK pause let's stop for a second I Know that you feel angry I can see\nYou feel angry tell me what you're feeling right now give them the latitude to be like oh\nLike don't Tom to calm down don't Tom stop screaming don't stop crying he can't hit he can't\nMaybe use profanity what makes me angry that anything what when someone looks to me 'cause okay calm down no yeah I found him in the fate rip their head\n[laughter] so we don't do that to your kids let them express it\nAnd then and validate them I understand oh my goodness I'm so sorry honey that happened oh honey\nYou know listen let them talk about it and then then but don't let them go down this spiral where they get angry and angry and I were you said let's go and the way that you said way out of that as you say what do you think right now\nYou want and out of the situation what do you think you need to happen\nWhat do you want the goal in this situation to be that will shift gears\nNow that I'm going to say this if it's physical let them go run let out hit a bat or a punching bag sometimes that activity does help so don't just regard that yeah\nYeah well and and and oh my goodness we're almost out of time I can't believe it okay well we're going to head out to rape when we come back we're going to continue this conversation looking at the after action review this

create more problems [noise]\nWell he is going to be like a greater more problem you know because that's what he wants he knows you want to hear that but if you say it like like I said at the first time calling so tiny that you think you know looking back at how it all played out do you feel like\nThe choices that you made actually met your need do you feel like it created an additional ... tell

with you for this final MCS game of the season for North Alabama the first year of division one football north Alabama has quite a combination of division one school division two schools today's match up\nAgainst Jackson State will be the final division one game for North Alabama this season and what has been an historic sees interviewing a football let's jump into this report\nPresented by boat hand in services families serving families since Nineteen Seventy one this will be the first ever meeting between north Alabama\nAnd Jackson State this is before the first time opponent the un has played this season you and I used to in one in the previous three meetings that gets first time opponents this season was wins against southern Utah has used the Pacific\nLaws being sue Campbell overall it's the third school from the state of Mississippi that north Alabama has played all the time\nOf course the other two delta state in Mississippi College to schools we're very familiar with so let's get to know Jackson State just a little bit Jackson State as a member of the slack in the tigers are coached by Tony Hughes who was in his third season\nJackson said it had a very rich football tradition over the years with four former tigers being inducted into the pro Football Hall of fame\nAnd of course those poor led by former NFL all time rushing leader Walter Payton\nThere's a cool connection there with Walter Payton and the un aid each year though Walter Payton award is handed out to the most outstanding ... player in the division one football championship subdivision that's the division the UN a now competes at\nWalter Payton played division two football however while at Jackson State while this was a division to remember he played for Nineteen Seventy one to Nineteen Seventy four in Russia for thirty six hundred careers yards and his collegiate career\nBefore being selected by the Chicago Bears the fourth overall pick in the Nineteen Seventy five ...\nOf course he finished his career is the NFL's all time leading Russia now ranked second all the time behind Emmett Smith who broke it before he retired\nIn Nineteen Ninety nine Walter Payton was adopted in to the inaugural class of the division two Football Hall of fame in Florence, Alabama so pretty cool connection there with Walter Payton in the University of north Alabama all coming back full circle and\nRyan let's meet this Jackson State team that we will see today a team with a three to record overall there's one common opponent with you in a meeting Alabama and m's twenty five to twenty week to\nWhite Alabama and am Jackson State truly one is sixteen and Wi Fi whose story lines for Jackson State really begin\nThey truly one is sixteen and week five who storylines for Jackson State really begin on the opposite side of the football when the last couple of weeks they've had some coaching changes in quarterback changes\nYeah name some of you might recognize has been their outfits have gotten into this year ... who was in Kentucky for a long time he's been around the SEC I've been around football for a long time he was their armpits coordinator for the first three or four games of the year\nAnd then resigned or is not hear any longer and so Derrick McCall has taken over the off into port Nader position and he has the right thing and that is really struggled they tend to change a quarterback a drawn Hayes is now the starting quarterback was daring ponder\nHayes is really put together some pretty decent numbers sixty six percent completion right four hundred and forty yard through the air force judge them and then you look at their running back they're led by Jordan Johnson three hundred and Ninety ... yards rushing on the air to TD\nAh got to do a great job on those running backs and you know the secondary have to you know play our coverage is the sound and um and you know when the balls in the air makeup but\nThey're starting to Jordan Johnson looks like he's the workhorse sixty nine ... nearly four hundred yards he had a big game last week in the home coming game they played against Mississippi Valley state what sort of runners see\nWell you know I think he can do it all I mean you know he runs in between the tackles and then once those ins or whoever's playing contain you know poke their eyes inside and you know he's he's quick enough and fast enough to bounce it outside so\nHe's the guy that you know we've got to have great gap integrity we've got to you know play with our pads and our hands and you know do a good job being where we're supposed to be within the call and because once you get out of your guy he's he's good enough to make you pay for\nTheir quarterback newly named quarterbacks starting quarterback Jared Hayes in that same when eight different wide receivers called passes what does this group look\nLike as a whole well you know I think that's one of the staples of this type of off and they they they really spread the ball around to the running backs different receivers you know there are very\nYou know buried ranging group you know they get down the field well\nI'm quarterbacks have you know really done a good job especially these last two weeks of\nFun and open guy and you know giving them very catch a ball so we expect to get challenged out down the field you know I think our our secondary you know us had a good week and you know we're we're excited about the challenge and uh you know I look forward to seeing I'm\nSeeing them play their coverage is and you know trying to get their hands on on some more balls\nAnd the office of climate they'll send out there what do they look like\nThey're a big group you know I mean they um do a good job you know\nStick you know a lot of inside zone outside zone\nI'm you know they are led by their centers good players so uh you know I mean it's a it's a group that you know if if if we just kind of staying there you know they'll they'll cover is up and and those running backs will kind of fun to Greece so the Pentagon needs to do a good job playing on their side of the line of scrimmage and you know\nForcing the double teams and you know if we don't get double ... you know we've got to do a good job getting up blocks and making tech\nSo finally forty ... want to see from your defense today against this office for us to come away with a\nWhim well

to the Veterans Memorial stadium here in Jackson, Mississippi north Alabama on the road taking on at Jackson State as we get back into the division one portion of this schedule last wrote game of this see them\nLet's take the time now to chat with you in a office of coordinator Ryan apple in and go jak but let's back up last week five possessions in the first half for touchdowns\nIn a field goal and you have to be very pleased with the way the ... played last week yes they did a good job um you know I think\nEarly those first penalty um they shallow frustrated but I'm all in all the guys at a great job of of on the way to get the ball in the end zone and um you know less than the one thing that was all years we've been able to for the most part and get down there you know we just try to take some lava Chandler you know you got to find a way to get in the end zone and we did that last week and\nYou know when you can do that versus a triple option team\nA light Mississippi College it it makes it easier for that defense and it keeps them healthy and keeps them or not tired you know they kind of get their breath on the sidelines so um our guys at a phenomenal job you know last week and I'm was very proud proud of him\nHow much of the office of success the last two weeks have come from the additional film study the guys have been putting him\n[noise] um I I think it definitely helps I think you know when when guys made a conscious effort to come in and not only watch their opponent and see how they play but come in and make sure\nI'm you know what we're doing off instantly they understand they know you know there's no confusion um you know a ... more second nature you know you're not thinking while out while you're out there playing football you're going through your rules or your routes or you read your combo blocks and\nUm you're just playing football and so when when it becomes like that you know it\nIt's a lot easier and then you tend to just play faster and guys you know just on the fly so all I think it makes a big difference\nQuarterback Christian Lopez has been great the last two ballgames five hundred one passing yards combined in the last two played with three passing touchdowns one rushing touchdowns on top of that is completed Seventy five percent of his passes and those two games what's been the difference for him\nHe's done a really good job you know I think just to understand the game plan and um you know I think he's really come for right now is in the system you know you've gotten through um several games and um he's kinda got a good feel of what we do offensive Lee or we talked about the first Jewish it's always an adjustment you know and I think\nYou're starting to see our guys really understand what we're doing on all things and how we're going to call a game\nAnd so I think when you get that comfort 'em and you know he's got the feel with his receivers and the running backs and a line and so\nI think all of that has you know place yeah but again the the way he prepares I'm that way they all prepare as a whole you know they they all know what to do and I think you've seen the progression um of the past two weeks we talked about ... four or five games for those guys are you comfortable with and they finally have gotten comfortable and\nUm you know one thing again we talked about who we we never have to worry about it I don't play hard so when you can marry those together um them being prepared knowing exactly what to do and what their upon it looks like and what they're going to do and\nThe hard work they put in we can and week out um you know that's the type of success you're going to have when you don't turn the football over 'em and you stay on track\nDamon Cox I think we've talked about him every week during the pregame show just about he finally gets that one hundred yard game one hundred five yards how big was this for not only him but for the office of line as well\nIt was awesome and I think uh it's a big tribute to the line and uh the one thing that sticks on everybody's mind is that more backed up on third and twelve and he made that effort you hit or miss I had a really good call on and got us\nUm he made that guy mission hid it for a big one so I'm really proud of those guys really happy for Damon he's earned it he's probably one of our hardest workers on off and she does I mean he works as tail off there's nights I've left here at nine PM you down the track\nA jump rope or doing pushups or doing something um so he just he's a type of kids you love is she has success 'cause he put his Oregon\nI let's turn to page now let's talk about this Jackson State team that we will see today on the road north Alabama plenty of Veterans Memorial stadium\nAgainst Jackson State found a real game of the season and once again another three main front that you guys will face I think this is the third maybe even for three main front in a row that we'll see uh what do they look like break down this defense\nA big long athletic up front I'm the same thing in the back and they've got to six foot corners of who are long run well I'm very physical at the point of attack and um they're really good tax was to do really good job and open field to do a good job of getting into the backfield and causing disruption and\nUm they do really good job within their scheme playing the rules are making plays and so they've gotten a lot of ... this year I'm a couple of interceptions and so uh it's it's definitely going to be a challenge this week uh they're probably one of the bigger groups all all around that we've seen\nCollege on homecoming well I thought it was the first game that we probably have played a complete game on all phases from special teams will made her kicks when we had great returns ... first five possessions we in in a lot of them Dr ... touchdowns instead of just bill goes\nAnd then eventually played an option football team which present a lot of problems and we were able to you know pretty much contain it in the first half and then we held him three points in the second half but you know that was good until the team you know when you play like that with all three phases in in foreclosure football that's the type of scores you'll get\nI Know it was homecoming you guys picked up the fiftieth when all time on homecoming there are a lot of festivities from a hall of fame to the alumni football games or an alumni baseball game pep rally the night before all those festivities I mean how great was it would all were you able to\nTake in a while you know I was able to do a lot and went to the rally that night and I went to the hall of fame though that morning and I know my wife she took the kids at the parade and\nThen you you know yet other events throughout the day we're not able to have to and I was able to stick my head and over here a little bit to the Evan owes me flag football and I went over to solve a bit of the ... baseball a cause ... each other but you know just a lot going on and it was great weather\nOn then to the top it all kind of where at the end of the night and everything to put the explanation there and and we were able to come away with it when\nYou mentioned how the defense held the Mississippi College rushing attacked over a hundred yards below their season average I mean how much of a tip of a hat should you get the discount seem often send the looks and they were able to give them last week\nI mean that was a great job of them and our GPA's who kind of met with them and and and work with 'em up to that point in a it's not easy and then I thought the majors Kurt former ... quarterback in high school who ran the option was able to come over and give us a look at it from playing on defense of sudden now\nAnd so that that really helped the speed of the game as hard as simulate against the option but they did a great job\nGo with the when the other night against Mississippi College we had Chandler career a kick to career long field goals of forty six yard field goal to close the first half\nThen the second half you knocked down to forty seven yards he'll go both breaking his previous career longer thirty nine and I says it to see him add some distance to what he's done so far this season including making his last ten ...\nYeah he he's done great you know ah that was pretty neat you know seem it feel go that was his record income right behind it to break it so\nHe's been consistent force issues but he's played really well and he puts in a lot of hard work in a well deserved to me he's one of those guys it puts in the extra time comes in early leaves lay in a in a gym and he's done a been a weapon for so to be honest with you know he's won a game for us and then you put the game out of reach I think the other night and\nHe's been a viable a weapon for\nSpeaking of weapons that we found a new weapon and kj Smith own returns\nPossibly you know we're we're given it you know the return guys all trying to get different looks back there I'm Jamal and him and but yeah he's he seems to be bringing something a little extra to the table there and we're lucky riding with him until otherwise\nAll of a sudden temperatures have dropped just a little bit a couple of rainy practices as well this week we had the bus trip down here to Jackson State and uh by week awaits us next week so big game today against Jackson State but how focuses this team during practice this week leading up to this game knowing they have a by week\nNext week I said we've been really focused uh you know I think they they understand that you know we're going to get some time off but we also don't want to sit around for a week thinking about coming off a law so I mean that that makes it that the ... not as enjoyable\nSo we'd like to get this when going into the ... we inhale up and be able to come back home and finish out to home games\nTalking with you and I head football coach Chris Willis north Alabama getting set to take on at Jackson State or would that coach practice this week on what's the word a week has been following\nThe homecoming when I spent a good week uh you know we went out in the rain and so we were ... we wanted to do that just in case and\nWhat type of weather will get here I'm sad or on the day's game um but you know it's been a good week uh we've had good weeks upright as we've shorten them down but we're now we just hit the main emphasis things we don't stay out there for two hours anymore I mean we're hour and a half hour and Fifteen minutes\nWould get the things we need to get done and we don't sit there and bang on each other the whole practice we just we make sure we get the game plan and we make sure we try to execute it and simulate what the other team's doing\nWe've traveled a lot this season to play some football games from Utah to North Dakota to North Carolina to the short trip to Huntsville eight in this road trip a little more unique a four and a half hour bus ride down here to Jackson, Mississippi at today coach and what's the challenge with this road trip versus some of the others that we've had\nWell this is really the first road trip we've had what we're on a bus for you know four and a half five hours um you know all the other bus trip we had this year was going about fifty miles up the road a in the um so every other troops pretty much get on a airplane land get on a bus get to the hotel\nSo you know we we've been pretty good handle on the road trips outside of maybe the Campbell game without North Dakota state even though we didn't win the game it was a great trip\nUm but you know a lot of work goes on behind the scenes on these trips and make these things happen you know that's where a little bit uh I get pulled away from the office and defense and I work with ...\nMap and these things that the best we can and put our players in the best situation you won't comfortable you want them relaxed you don't want I'm stressed out a word about how we're getting there and the times and all that so that's that's our job and we try to make it as relaxing as we can begin\nToday's opponent Jackson estate coached by Tony shoes a coach that you know very well and what sort of your connection with him\nWell just over the years just he's been a he's a fan of been in the Mississippi area for quite some time he's\n... he's been a different view goes up he was at Mississippi State him and hug were there together one who was there as first time around with ... and so um\nYou know I used to run into all the time recruiting lot just we met each other probably through people I've worked at camp back at Mississippi State one time and I had to work with him there and a camp so I got to know him during that time and so a just a good guy and always villain you know do a good job of ... a class act in a you know he'll have his team ready to go\nThis historic program coach Walter Payton played here there's been several other greats over the years but this season the twenty eighth team team they've had some some things they've had to overcome they replaced and all kinds of coordinator they've had a quarterback change in today's game what do you think this team will look like\nWell they've got a really good running back we've got to do a good job of containing him I don't know if you can stop incomplete\nOh they'll\n\n[noise]\n[noise] oh I Know [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nI mean a lot of echo\n[noise]\nHere's the thing about Diet Coke [noise]\nIt ... it makes me feel

got the thing home and you're like this a worst thing ever\nHappened to my mother in law and father in law that they bought a mattress in a mattress store and hated it so much but you know all sales

purchasing our first home\nAnd I will bottle yo\nYou shouldn't do all of it maybe we should rent [laughter] wow\nWell yes [laughter] you just have to buy me a lot of advice or what I what I heard\nAs I heard cash flow knocking out the door starting a business moving buy a house starting a business all in short order\nYeah\nHow and the world would you sleep at night you must they must feel no

would've exploded\nSo oh my goodness\nMaybe years ... who can handle the dual 'cause you gotta do suck there on cash flow by home and starting a business so which is more important to you right

entrepreneurial P.

going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you rent you know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay how are you for the business\nI'm a combination of a sudden some cash and to some some alone time so it would be and that Santa franchises as they're out we're going to go and then um we have a twenty percent down saved away for the home if we need to delay we sure can\nYeah I was literally I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be casual positive and how many months then they tell you\nI promise anything they show is their best guy their worst guy in their average guy and and I and even their worst guy would\nBe okay with us\nOkay All right well that's good I ... and ... either you you say we as you and your husband are going to own the business have either of you worked in the industry before that you're going to have this franchise\n[noise] we have not\nSo I'm just all a stop signs and red lights right now I'm a big fan of one of you going to work for one of the franchise is doing anything and everything for at least three months\nMhm because you got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really like for you to a experience at one or both of you to experience the business before you're all done\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk\nYou there's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time that of lemonade or issues concerns
