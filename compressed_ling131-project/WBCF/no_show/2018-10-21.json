Jason how are you Mike I'm so good and I'm Glad you're doing good as well because we were chatting before we started and you have reason to be excited [laughter]\nJason I got to mesh wife by system in my house at the moment and it is dramatically changed my life\nIt's a glorious day for any tech guy to uh to upgrade\nThe whole home all at once with a ... system it is stunning is studying and\nYou know we should probably talk a little bit about you know how we got here both you and I were you told me ... and I can't remember why you're houses weird why is your house weird for why fight right well so what you're weird\n[laughter] yeah so my house is a it was built in Nineteen forty\nEight okay and the master bedroom is\nActually the garage that was on like the back of the house that has no access to the front of the house where you could ever get a car in it so they're just like well if we can't put a car and it was making a master bedroom but for that but for that reason the um where the cable comes into my house near the front of my house is very far away\nAnd through the kitchen and multiple walls\nAway from the bedroom so uh\nIt's really hard to get Internet all the way back there right right right right okay so similar\nTo my mind built in the late forties although my house and I guess they're probably common elsewhere but I'm In Southern California we have a concrete block house and on top of that plaster walls so we've got\nSuper challenge and like you it was a small house that we added on to maybe Fifteen Years ago um but you know when we when we first got brought Internet when broadband it in fact we got broadband short it's just a little bit before we did an addition actually so we've got um\nWe we one of the things we added on to was a we had an office and so in early days of of well we did I mean there was a wife fight even than it was just a hardwired coming into that office on the new construction which is\nBasically just sticks and and dry wall so typical construction but the old part of our house where our television is and all that stuff\nSchool construction but the old part of our house where where our television is and all that stuff\nDoesn't you know there was no Internet connection and didn't matter because we just needed it for the office but then as we moved into the realities of smartphones and all that stuff and then becoming court cutters\nWe really wanted that Internet in our ... and you know in the area that has the the plaster walls and the and the concrete block walls and we got a wife I extenders you didn't it actually worked considerably better you know it was it was a dramatic step up at least got the Internet there\nYes exactly but because that room uses television principally and of course that's that's using lots of bandwidth to to you know to stream video\nSo it's like you and I are similar in that so you're further the area where you needed the most help was for television right and same with me as well as my my wife was just walking by her to be talking about this and she was saying since we've had you know she has noticed\nIt just again you know you get used to this kind of you know the little hiccups when you're watching TV and and uh you know watching Netflix will say and you know it just it just it'll it'll kind of you know you'll get the little spinning icon for just a second you know and and you'll notice it just kind of\nIt that doesn't chicken super fast like when we go to friends' houses that have a much sturdier why flies connections so that's that that those little ... things are completely eliminate eliminated it with the ... and I assume it is with us well for\nWith mash yeah definitely well and so there there are ah there's more features within the after we haven't covered but we will I'm\nOn now let's defer to the experts there you go when we come back we're going to talk to him it rarely from next year and he's going to tell us more about the ... and

from a regular why fire router\nAnd possibly with a range extender versus ... network\nAbsolutely ...\nMe actually start off with um what ... and how ... got started and why\nOr with the world was before I guess I'm fourth quarter of twenty sixteen when the whole why fight systems or mashed category um we use those to jail terms interchangeably uh got started um the problem that it's really trying to solve that\nYou know terms interchangeably got started um the problem that it's really trying to solve is that you know traditionally um people started off with um having a single route or in the house um\nAnd they typically that somewhere wherever they're cable modem or their DSL modem was and from there you know your wife I signal hotter propagated through your house every time it went through a metal object or wall or feeling\nThan signal and I got knocked down some people solve that problem by uh\nPutting extenders all over the place now extenders are great I mean what they do is they really amplified the signal but what you're really doing is you're you're creating you're getting coverage but you're creating away speed\nBecause the the\n... the signal that being sent from your iPhone or your laptop to arrange extender basically goes over to the medium back the router\nUh we're ... systems or why systems are um stand out it was that um they have a separate channel just for the the connectivity between the multiple devices that are\nAll part of the system so firstly they all come together they all have a single wife I name so you're not going off and saying oh

bothered changing the default password on their wife I route or because they just don't want to sign into that thing and get into all the nitty gritty of it\nOf um especially of hooking up an extender\nBut that once the um the mesh systems started coming out and there's like an app to control adding a note and things like that within the network it so much easier to use and so much more user friendly to to add a note or to\nChange people's allowances for things like that it it just made it so much easier\nAbsolutely that's I've gone to so many people's houses and when I ask them for

that that the the medical practices\nAnd also there are a number of shipwrecks down that so you know we say that the deep sea is the world's largest museum but we just don't\nYet have access to 'em\nAnd so this will really open up that high\nLate to really understanding our own human history and as well and and then a lot of the reasons that we change in the tree it has caused this competition is because\nWe know that the field of the reality is changing at an exponential rate as well and so we really want to start tapping into being able to access\nAnd see and visualize and they're in the ocean in a different way and as we are starting to do with like models for example\nAnd and vibrant losing the shit from the equation and making this much cheaper we actually capitalizing markets and we paid the wasteful deep sea conservation a deep sea environmental management as well as like I said maybe ... ...\nIt seems like a lot of the teams that\nHave made their way to the final finals\nTeams that have made it their way to the final finals are are from colleges\nAre there any like non college teams um that made their way into the competition in an interesting way or is the best way to make your way into a competition like this are just start by picking a college that their focus is on\nUm a ventures of this type\nThat's a great question actually we do we have one month team who is a working currently let your legs I suspect that's going to change soon the aid getting onto the next round but\nAnd and that's the teams in Switzerland and we do have a number as a you know the the affiliated teams as well as you know the routine and so in the competition and I think\nNot just this X prize to every X prize is a great platform for the future\nEngineers and scientists to really get that hands on something and work on something that they would not normally have an opportunity to do it during a visit to Korea though it really comes by and then to continue on that track\nAnd we hit that feedback from a huge and then there's on the other teams quite regularly\nAnd when it comes to joining the X prize or as a team um how much do you have to bring to X prize to\nTo fit the criteria do you can you just come with an idea or do you need to come with a finished product I'm ... and a bunch of money or or what is it really looked like for somebody who joins X prize I'm\nA I'm a ... or the resources for for for the teams and things like that\nYeah to a if you enjoy the team and as I said we sampled the avatar X prize that just slowing\nAnd quite often the thing and a rounded and based on and the idea so if you have a great idea it actually doesn't match race either ... or your full time employees federal law\nAnd order a retired and we had we've had teams in the past two of you know retired and and they go and they develop the technology in the garage in to an end to a competition but each competition has and\nThat is going to anyone and everyone anyone with a great idea and joy and and and to see what it takes them so example the Wendy's Schmidt oil cleanup ex challenge when the ten final team who is a tattoo parlor scientists\nFor awhile and\nSo you know to really and and he was one of the finalists\nOr can we as we say as good I dig can confirm absolutely anyway so I strongly encourage anyone who has a good idea to have a look at the website and see if they want to take caught in the great adventure and you never know it takes you\nYeah that's great it's really nice to know that ah it's not just

with Dr Ted Wilkie he's the senior principal engineer for intel labs so we know that intel labs and partly for the oceans are partnering up to collect data from Wales which part of the process is intel technology being used\nIdentification and more filed a tree identification I think we all relate to that right away I mean we all\nAre carry identification and ah we want to be able to identify our our pets and\nPeople have been tracking and tagging animals in the wild for for a long time I'm In Wales I mean it's really hard to see these animals and identify them and we'd like to be able to uh consistently know which ones we have samples on how they're doing overtime right\nUm so we were on the hunt for the wealth fingerprint if you will\nSecond thing I mentioned was more more ... similar fond of tree is that in general is the study of ah what you can learn from studying an object shape\nIn this case we're talking about the shape of oil and that's an interesting question here because\nUh whales or a ... to carry the vast amount of energy that they have on board in their fat\nAnd it shows you know they show um so if we can er during the between a health a whale of a healthy weight from oil that set it on ... the way we can learn a lot about survival its ability to procreate and we can correlate that information\nAnd draw conclusions with the samples we take you know what is not bought and uh the general conditions of the environment they're in on both locally in in the region\nAnd all along their journeys\nSo while we saw the immediate potential of applying artificial intelligence to drone feeds and\nGoing after identification and more ...\nWhen you take the samples from the whales and you're learning about or their their environment um what kind of data are you able to take from the whales\nOr possibly about their environment or what they're eating or which I'm part of the world they're at and and then give that data to local governments or advocacy groups or or things like that\nSo the answer to that as being able to identify these animals individually and I'm drones provide us with a great opportunity for that is just so happens that they are I'm\nVery distinguishable from their flu patterns so the foot fist apart or or to fluke son of well it's what makes up their tail\nAnd then they die they they come up\nAnd when they come up with a good shot we need a better shot taking it from a drone camera so we're already out there to collect the sample so is the animals died\nWe get a shot to smoke and the algorithms are able to process\nAnd identify the before the drones even back the boats so that on television comes in with this problem so that then we can\nI is animal to their environment their journeys and even the cohorts or the other animals that out you know it's very important to understand uh the relationships within um the feeding groups and um and that\nIt seems like a if you look at any\nUm scientific

breast cancer awareness of that wonderful yeah so now it's cancer happens laugh anyway sure and it it takes back the control like you you can't control what you have cancer but you can't control\nYour attitude about having cancer while do that\nWe're talking with Tracy to grow she's a cancer survivor and author and a two years two years cancer free praise God um water on the uh\nI don't know what kind of feedback are you getting from from ladies out there as you tell your story or what what kind of encouragement are you getting when it comes to taking a a really you know terrifying topic and putting it in a comedy ...\nWell you know how it is with comedy uh um it's all self deprecating so it's all it's all my story it's not like I'm making light of anyone else's story or taking their\nUm situation and making light of it I'm telling my own story I mean this is really how it happened I really sat across my doctor and said that's all you got Thirty years [laughter] you know so and and I like that kind of organic um\nTo me it's just it's not really writing I've heard a lot of comic say this is not really writing and says writing it down it's just kind of like having that perspective yeah sure so so you don't get any pushback\nFrom that because by the time I get to that cancer part of the story they've already kind of gotten to know me 'cause I Do an hour show and\nYou have already kind of gotten the field for oh this is just how Tracy roses just who she is okay but at the end when I'm doing these breast cancer if I have a mission I have a message on the message is be proactive about your health and so I go over the excuses that women give me of why they're not getting on the anagram and what are the excuses\nOh trust me here here we go right so one of them is I don't have time to get a mammogram yeah and and so then I just address that with guess what when cancer shows up it takes everything from you write your whole calendar now you're going to have some time all year to know why you're\nSo so that's one another one is I don't have insurance well not an excuse sell your car\n... what are you going to do with your car if you can't breath but the truth is that there's a lot of states that have free mammograms or deeply discounted mount a ground she just got a check in your area sure shy and oh yeah yeah and don't call the hospital and ask them because in Illinois\nYou can get a free man of granting Illinois free pap yeah absolutely free\nBut if you call the hospital I asked him about that they won't tell you because they'll tell you that will give you half price because they're going to at least are going to take their money the ramming sure [noise] so so you have to be aware\nAnd then another big excuse that I get it all her well so what a lot of things hurt you know they only hurts for a minute [laughter] not even a minute so you just have to endure that so that it's less suffering to get a mammogram than it is to have cancer this\nHave you really want it every year since you were forty and yes you were forty one so you've ... you've lived through to twice the ... you know you don't you let\nThem [laughter] I Am not forty one I Am fifty\nTwo I Am fifty two I Will tell you how old I Am I Will lie about my weight of Jesus comes\nOut as fast [laughter]\nIsn't that right there either\nThat's why a zoo in\nThe final thing that women give me as an excuse as they say then that's the most stupid thing that they say is I don't want to know if I have kids\nOh yeah yeah yeah\nAnd and then just tell them I think picture of yourself and your bed at night found asleep and there's a fire in your home at one point would you want to become aware right of the fire\nWould you want to know when you can blow it out like blowing out a birthday candle or would you want to know and now you're fighting for your life that it's like so you got to get your cancer screenings you have to not optional\nAnd or if it's not thinking of yourself or would imagine thinking of or your loved ones I'm not\nYou know the only thing worse than hearing the word you have cancer is saying the words I have cancer oh somebody loves sure as a fact\nSure yeah and this message I understand some men get a breast cancer as well um they have to be you know are looking out for about a I Know that it's not as not as common but then there's the other types of male cancer and there's you know everyone should be aware and just uh\nI don't know take the time to to make sure you're OK and get the check ups and it's a beautiful thing when it's caught early and sniff though like you say of his life changing message here from Tracy the graph\nI'm In a life changing message or from Tracy the graph not only comedy but a a chance to to to live

another experience with salmonella outbreak this time tied the raw chicken\nNinety two people from twenty nine states ... had been sick into the salmonella outbreak linked to raw chicken the Centers for Disease Control and prevention are reporting on this Twenty one people were sick enough that they ended up being hospitalized\nThank goodness as of yet nobody has died [noise] the CDC has not identified a common source for the contaminated chicken that's not good\nIt says a there is some evidence that many types of raw chicken products from a variety of sources contain the strain\nAs ... and but this is making people ill ...\nThe uh the thing that's been done revealed that the ... strain involved in the outbreak is resistant to many types of antibiotics and that's what's happening these microbes these parasites\nAdapt\nThey may be microscopic and they don't have a giant brain but let me just tell ya they they'd been around millions of years they know how to survive\nThe invested\nThey they've been around millions of years they know how to survive\nThe investigators have identified the outbreak strain on raw chicken pet food\nRaw chicken products and live chickens indicating it might be widespread and the chicken industry my goodness\n\n[noise] now the at the same time now that the CDC has everybody alarmed [laughter] and and me too um they say don't need to avoid eating properly cook chicken and that's the point\nYou have to make sure it's thoroughly cooked and furthermore when you're handling the raw chicken and you got your cutting board\nWeathered no matter what surface it is whether it's wood whether it's glass whether it's metal and makes no difference you need to wash that cutting board down with hot water and soap\n\nBecause you you cut the chicken and now you're going to go make salad off that same board and you haven't you haven't\nSterilized aboard\nYou're going to get sick\n\nNow a health officials say the outbreak should serve as a reminder to always cook raw chicken carefully and thoroughly it contains the ... it can contain germs and spread around the food prep areas as I've just been saying and ... and it will\n\nUm the USDA food and safety inspections service or advisors that raw chicken products including chicken breast whole chickens in ground poultry or such as chicken burgers and chicken sausages\nOr sausage should be always cooked to an internal temperature of a hundred and sixty five degrees so that the pathogenic bacteria or germs are killed\n\nLeftovers should also be cooks to a hundred and sixty five degrees\n\nA health experts do not recommend washing raw poultry or meat as bacteria in the poetry and meet uses can spread to other foods utensils and surfaces\nReal quick you said even leftovers shouldn't he be re yeah too\nBecause I Know people that will cook something put it in the fridge writer and then like the next day grab like a cold peace of chicken meat eat\nYeah and they're saying don't do that yeah I'm just saying I can see that makes sense as cross contamination from one surface to another from your hands to\nWherever you have to wash your hands thoroughly ... counters that cutting boards utensils with warm I Would say hot soapy water\nAfter they touch raw chicken\nI'm curious to how much a salmonella or those types of um [noise] a little bugs pathogens um are on

what's that all about\nWell there was a meta analysis\nThat was reported last week or so that say vitamin D supplements do not improve bone health that's a major study\nAnd what they mean by major study as a meta analysis that we've talked about this on your program before just to refresh people's memory meta analysis is supposed to be the top form of validating studies where you take a bunch of studies with similar protocols\nAnd you add them together to magnify the results so you have a larger population base\nAnd then you can try to see if the results that are significant and there are some problems with applying the meta analysis model to vitamin D and first of all is they're measuring supplementation\nAnd they're measuring things like a bone fractures and fall off\nAnd they're measuring things like a bone fractures in fall\nIn other words it's the issue of homogeneity ... is there was there enough homogeneity among all the studies that they used in the methods and procedures\nThat would lead to would would not create bias\nOr that's one of the issues with these kinds of studies there's not enough light Mr homogeneity between and among the studies that they're using ... or collapsing the ... from which there are collapsing the data uh I didn't mean to interrupt you but that's the issue go ahead\nAnd they are and it increased by us\nAnd in this case they're measuring vitamin D supplementation and of course of course people take different kinds of vitamin D and they take different doses so unless you're screening for that then they're not going to be the same\nThe bigger problem is vitamin D is not a drug it's in the food supply and we make it from sunlight\nAnd unless you're measuring blood levels which actually have better data than supplementation\nThen you're not and you don't know if someone's taking a supplement but they're very low maybe\nThey're still very low levels and they're not getting the protection they would expect\nAnd these studies are not revealing that because they're not looking at the blood levels they're not looking at diet and sunlight and supplementation they're only looking at one of the three ways that we can get vitamin D so they're not really telling you about what different levels of vitamin D do\nMoreover\nThat just assume for a minute let's just leave bone health out of vitamin D three serves other purposes as well doesn't it\nThat are in fact there was a report I saw that said that this was in a\nBBC him Anglin's where a professor was saying that if you take vitamin D it helps immunity and\nThey actually showed it was better than a flu vaccine that reduce your risk of getting influenza this is very important to be this isn't a label claim obviously\nYeah I mean\nThe meta analyses are are fine I they're they are not with out their\nProcedural and methodological issues again with meta analysis you're taking a bunch of studies and collapsing the data bringing it into you know using that ... you get a bigger sample size and you get more data\nThat they were making a lot of assumptions\nThe one that Neal's pointing out is exactly on point did they say you were the ... the studies that they used they used this how did they was their comparability in the amount of vitamin D three that they were using and the studies was it the same kind um was it um\nI I mean I can go down the list here that day or\nDid they did they draw any blood samples did they do some in some studies drop samples and others that I was they didn't and other words how homogeneous wore those studies\nAnd how many studies I don't know do you happen to know off the top you're at how many they were using and that met analysis\nI Believe it was eighty five something like that yeah well a lot of studies but well there's a lot I ... the same\nI can tell you one thing without even looking at it eighty five studies I'm going to tell you right now I'll pay I'll go out on a limb there's a lot of very of but there's a lot of variability between among those studies and how those studies were conducted\nOn a I'm just saying or not I have to look at it but I you gotta watch out for bias in these kinds of studies that I mean it really is problematic I Would not stop taking vitamin D a Neal's going to tell you why in even more detailed when we come back I'm Glad you brought this up

I don't want to medical school one of my favorite um lectures I had I've told you guys about this one is how\nWe would look at art and look at these renaissance pictures or you know as I Am from pictures from I don't know all the different um well Aaron\nAnd you would look at the person inside the picture that picture was about a quarter was about and diagnosed with something medical\nI just love doing that I'll look at a picture and I'll Try to diagnose somebody I don't know why I Do that I really need more hobbies I just don't have enough hobbies\n[noise] not what I Do is try to decide what\nMedical condition the artists could have had and if that had an effect on his art or British researcher beat me to it\nBecause I think of it and he thinks that Leonardo da Vinci actually had an eye condition called stripper business or what we know in layman's terms as lazy eye\nAnd they think that his lazy I provided him a different sense of death when it came to a painting and that's why his portraits back in the fourteen Ninety than early Fifteen hundred\nLooked so three D. now his extra business it's called ... ... the trophy as we're one I lose outward\nSo it's not in sync with the other I and I run a little article on this on my website if you want\nAnd author Christopher Tyler who's a professor at City University of London and the Smith kennel well I research Institute in San Francisco state one of the things he is most famous for in his three D. modeling and what she adds up to thirty layers of shading\nTo get the subtle gradient\nHe said this is the kind of kill you don't notice ... full three D. vision but it can be more of parents if you shut up or shut off one by\nSo I don't know much about art I'm really really bad at drawing\nAnd colors and painting and I'm just not that good at it\nI could pay other people's mail so now\nI'm not very good at art but what I Do however notice is um\nWhen you look at Leonardo da Vinci's work they really seemed to have\nThis depth to them that I don't see a lot of other pain like I'm looking right now with the Mona Lisa and what really strikes me about the Mona Lisa is her left hand and we've talked about this her left hand\nHas this bump audit\nIt halfway between her wrists and the bus and her second finger and she's got this probably three\nCentimeter lump\nOn her hand if you look at the Mona Lisa\nUntil years ago I made this little thing on Facebook art of medicine and I decided to diagnose myself some things when you know at the end of the art and so I think she might have had a ... says we're talking about Mona Lisa by the way the Mona Lisa was the wife of front that's called ... condo\nSo apparently front that go told Leonardo will you please paint my wife\nAnd Leonardo is like well you know let's do it on the ship and then allow then like the ... trying to make a Titanic thing I wasn't working well anyway but go ahead as white painted and that ended up being the Mona Lisa and the Mona Lisa is is considered to be one of the most talked about um\n[noise] um some I mean I literally ... songs I ... it she's ... it's probably one of the most famous piece so she could have had a\nDonald Trump has suggested that this might have been a ploy I I don't know I mean I there's a lot of issues going on\nI ... in Central America and I I get why people want to come but this show look organized\nAnd so it's a little concerning because if we have refugees mixed in where these people really are looking for asylum these are people looking for some safety\nI think they're being taken advantage of\nWhat other political I'm\nA show voters ... secretary of state is now heading into meetings in Mexico city\nHe has met just for the leaders say stop them before they reach the U.S border there is a big question now is Mexico going to allow the migrants to come in and then if so what what will they do so Mexico\nI don't know if they want the thousands more people coming in especially since they have a lot of their issues however if they think that they're just passing through\nAnd apparently many of these migrants are from what we understand swapping some of their bought 'em all the money for Mexican pesos and self Mexico things we have thousands of people come in and just to be here temporarily like tourists\nWill spend money in our country and they're going to the U.S [noise] they may say fine go right ahead\nNow we're hearing stories that they are stopping them allowing you know refugees a process where they could um where they could you know find safety cetera and and start going through that process but there's a chance that Mexico may be mad at us and say you know what\nWe'll just go through if you if you want to pass through just pass through\n[noise]\nSo apparently they're crossing the sushi I'd say river as we speak it is an official crossing point\n[noise]\nSo they stay in recent days Mexican authorities have made a point of showing that there were stepping up security there the country's southern border Mexican federal police released a video of officers arriving in the border state of Chiapas some heavy riot gear\nThan Mexico's government released a statement according to CNN than anyone with a valid visa will be able to answer and move freely anyone who wants to be recognized as a refugee or as a beneficiary of complementary protection measures must do so individually\nThose who do so will be held at a migratory stations for up to forty five business days\nAnyone who enters in an irregular manner will be rescued is subject to administrative procedure and were appropriate it will be returned to their country of origin in a safe an orderly manner\nNow Mexican authorities said that they've also asked for help from the United nations their high commissioner for refugees to process migrants he can refugee status\n[noise] now [noise]\nThey say this as a chef from previous policies what humanitarian or transit visas were issued and migrants were given the option of continuing their jury north if they didn't want to seek asylum in Mexico\nSo apparently remember the last spring the ones the caravan of Central American migrants across into Mexico and then they ended up making it to the U.S border so then it gets tricky if Mexico does what it claims they can do\nThat could work whoever has a valid visas commit whoever wants to refugees than it will be held at a migratory station for forty five business days that clears our election and unfortunately the election as a part of this it also\nAllows them to do some um some are not soul searching but\nI'm I'm I'm\nI Can't believe I'm thinking and you know when you you know when you apply for your job background check my background check you know or if they're sick kind of like Ellis Island type of thing\n[noise] and then\nAnd the migratory station awfully fed kept safe cetera have security veterans ... go in the refugee status and then anybody who just enters illegally or through riots or whatever gets deported that could work\nNow I don't know what our relationship as the Mexico right\nHe\nSaid that he was going to send troops to shut down the southern us border of Mexico failed to stop what he called a non ...\nSo we have trade deal we have issues with the wall this could be bad Mexico we have to see if they're going to crack or if they're going to control\nCaribbean and Mexico doesn't really seem to be at the\nControl the Caribbean and Mexico doesn't really seem to be the reputation of being in control as we see what the cartel\nAnd so some people say well who cares that let this caravan of people you see children and their let them come to America is hiding among these migrants caravan who are trying to sneak in\nThere could be some real bad people in there they have to be that it\nIt's just something that has been frustrating people I mean and and ... our immigration policies it's\nNot about well you know we're worried about who's going to vote for who were worried about our national security we're worried about our jobs there's a lot of things that come into play\nNow Kenya and the echo Mexican president from what we understand it the lame duck\nHe only as less than two months left in office to trying to do enter any international policy locations is going to be tricky his predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office December one\nNow\nLopez Obrador had indicated that his administration will quote stopped doing the dirty work for the United states by detaining Central American immigrants\nAnd he ought to work you would offer to work visas to offer a work visa so Central Americans is that whoever wants to work in our country is going to have support is going to have a work visa\nWe are not going to attend to the issue only with deportations are means of force so immigration policy immigration is now going to be the distraction from the cabinet\nBump that the GOP got with um that theatrical that happened a few weeks ago and so we're coming up on a very contentious Mitt terms and we're going to talk more about some of the Senate races and you know house races that are up for grabs\nSome pretty big you know Florida Rick Scott is up against Bill Nelson um we have Claire McCaskill against Josh Holly in Missouri we have Dean Heller against Jacky Rosen in Nevada and so\nYou know there's some real tricky tricky races and the Democrats could take over the ...\nAnd they want to take over the ... the Democrats and wants to take over the Senate for a very very long time\nAnd if anybody you know things on on a you know what let's just trust the process we have to trust the process but what happened a few weeks ago\nThat was one hell of a Humvee being are right in the bottom of the nine that came out against the Kavanaugh Supreme Court I mean they were almost able to successfully derail\nThe Supreme Court nomination\nAnd it was vicious and you had ... and I'm not saying it was actually the Democratic establishment organizing all this but people who feel strongly one way or another\nSeemed to not have any qualms about accusing people of spiking drinks and orchestrating gang Shane rape parties\nThese are some really big accusations that started to come out of the woodwork and we have an election coming\nAnd if the liberals realized that they you know what I'm not saying that liberals there's all there's a lot of light and I said you get liberals out there but if the other side of things that that could be effective enough to sway public opinion what are they going to come up with a couple of days before the election\nAnd it might have to deal with this immigration wanting seven seven does sound like [noise]\n\nDo the letters iris

everybody says take the lump sum get the money now while you can invest it do what you can with it right\nAlthough for me if I Won that much money I Would probably want to have a retirement plan so I Would probably say you know what do you leave but one hundred million now I could be fine with the one hundred million and make sure I can get an alec lots for Thirty years I don't want the lump sum\n[noise]\nApparently a Michigan I may hear pharmacists refused to give Rachel Peterson thirty five years old a prescription called ... song [noise] arm is a problem though which is supposed to help and do\nA um the evacuation of\nA fetus but she had been carrying at the time [noise] what makes this very very tricky as she had gone to the doctor she was thirty five years old\nAnd\nThe seat as did not have a heartbeat so the dogs are gave her the medications to help her pass it because if you do have unfortunately a dead seated that you don't start that that could be dangerous [noise] and\nSo ah ... help that but the pharmacists who worked for the pharmacy ... well we don't know a hundred percent if the pharmacist was fired or if he resigned\nBut the pharmacy says well we can't comment on any pharmacy customer matter we apologize for any customers that does not align with our core valley\nSo if you tried to pick up the prescription at I think my or is the name of the pharmacy and Pataki Michigan She was on vacation and farms and so they cannot fell it because he was a good Catholic mail that they're going to the ACLU complained\nShe eventually talk more than three hours to her home in ... one of the farmers has had a difficult time getting the prescription\nShe said when you're out one of the law as members of your life you don't expect that sort of demeaning treatment of pharmacy should not be able to drive patients medications prescribed by their doctors face on the\nPersonal beliefs of a particular employee and this is bringing up this is going to be a huge debate not only from a religious standpoint but\nHey\nInner medical debate of when I was kind of medicine you felt ... pharmacists\nAre\nEducated they have their own training and you have still pharmacists I disagree with what the doctors prescribing as far as they're now getting in trouble\nPharmacists are now be liable for something another doctor right such as a narcotic and they are allowed on top of me but that can turn into a huge him that\nSell according to\nIt's a huge amount so according to um I Believe this is I'm not exactly\nSure who's a we have a name here I'm reading this I think we have a typo in this but there is a quote by somebody who says a practice is based upon an overwhelming concern for patient safety and care\nBalance with the need to accommodate the religious least of our employee that just said a pharmacist may refuse to fill a prescription based on religious beliefs have our procedure requires a prescription to then be felt by another pharmacist in the store if another pharmacist not available the prescription you'll be transferred to another location that has to be here for the patient now\nYou see this is something that that I thought was already organized than all ready you know ... now and and you know\nAlready planned out what\nDoes that solve the problem for those with religious convictions if you don't want somebody to let they have an abortion even though\nThey're saying in this case she actually already miscarried and this was to help save her and and evacuate but maybe under Catholic law still that's not okay that's fine\nI Love the Catholic religion I think it's a beautiful religion but let's say under Catholic run it for those your Catholic maybe you could comment one eight seven seven duck valley [noise] if you're a pharmacist and you don't want to give the medication\nAnd you referred to another pharmacist are you still involved in the action\nI mean with me in Judaism if let's say I don't know let's go back to biblical times let's say I don't want to kill somebody but I refer somebody else to kill somebody I'm so guilty\nAnd so I'm Wondering if that policy isn't that policy has still some issues with it from a religious standpoint now get\nWe don't know what have I mean I we we don't exactly know what happened ... only be told by the ACLU that he says he was a Catholic mail and that was the reasoning\nThat might have been something else going on I don't know but Marisa Kobach a policy strategist at the age of Michigan said this is a really traumatic terrible thing and I'm probably one of the worst days worst moments of her life she walked into the pharmacy can healthcare wasn't segment by someone who is shaming her and accusing her of lying about our miscarriage\nSo\nDo we as humans and people of faith to have a right to practice our religion\nOr can we be forced by the ACLU or by government agency to do something\nNow somebody can say well that's Dalia this could have been all cleared up if she would have shown proof that she was getting a miscarriage and she wants to get an abortion that it was a miscarriage but then on the flip side you do deserve a right to privacy as a patient\nIf I was a patient and I wanted the pack and the\nPharmacist goes R U Z pack because you want just a match for comedy or do you want the Z pack because you're treating a bronchitis okay first of all none of your guts are business I have a bronchitis I'm giving you a ... cell leading the pack\n\nBut then on the air and now like you see it was not ... when you go to a pharmacist for narcotic they have a pharmacist cells X number narcotics and somebody does the ... the math and thinks it's too much that pharmacist or pharmacy can be suit\nWe have the major issues here pharmacist have right pharmacists are allowed to practice their religion they are allowed to protect themselves from last but what do you do as a consumer as a patient when you want your privacy and you want your prescription\nAnd so what we've probably may have to do is go back to school or if a doctor wants you to have a meditation and it's a medication that is very highly contentious than that Dr stocks that medication and prescribes the medication from his office\nThe doctors used to do that we used to not have middlemen with pharmacies doctors that have the medications that have the teachers [noise] they would go to your own\nGive you the treatment do whatever and you're done\n\nBut managing a pharmacy is a big deal now that we have so many drugs and so many drugs out there and doctors don't want to be you know hit by burglars and you know and robbed and you know and and they they don't want to go through that hassle\nBut I'm Wondering if that's going to be the only way to fix this they have a doctor wants you to have the medication he obviously believes in that medication he writes it keeps the farmers without a visceral farmers\nAnd doesn't get in trouble either through the pharmacy legally or through their religion\nBut it is tricky stuff\nI mean and you just wonder why these stories are popping up all of a sudden now\nIs it that the media is covering it is it that now their social media so we can tell everybody about it I really feel bad for this woman I mean that things when you lose a child that's horrible\nAnd a yeah if you're not miss carrying it on your own it could be a medical emergency you need to be able to evacuate the jet fetus and if you don't have to undergo surgery or dial a tissue and curate Taj you could do it through pill form help and just the ... the the the contractions um it may be safer\nBut if he thinks he's been due to somebody's trying to get an abortion I you know he has every right to defend his religious beliefs\nAnd we need to figure out a way to I'm Bridget\nWhen it comes down to ... Seventy OCD a I\nI don't know what's going on here but now there are more of them are circulating set him where he wants to run a twenty twenty lord have mercy on when he comes some definitely [noise]\n\n\nMost of you know good heart diseases the number one time a killer in the U.S what if I told you project fifty four Ninety five a month you could fight against heart disease naturally\nAt heart and body extract we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart don't just take my word for word check out all of the success stories at H.

revolves around stress and how to manage it and of things like focus and how to stay in the zone so that you have a quality of life and your functioning optimally that's what this show is all about and that's what this topic is all about\nInventor and chief science officer of touch points doctor Amy Sharon is joining us she is a leading narrow psychologist specializing\nIn the evaluation prevention and diagnosis as well as treatment of mental and behavioral brain based issues in her Sharon center clinics in the state of Arizona for more than a decade\nShe provided therapy and consulted with militaries and international global crises responders with the goal of trading at eradicating post traumatic stress disorder everybody knows that his pie TST\nShe led to that led this led to the breakthrough realization\nThat a cutting edge technology component of successful treatments for P. TST could be used outside of doctors' offices to relieve stress anytime resulting in bringing touch points which we are going to talk about the world\nOf Dr Sharon is an international speaker an award winning\nA person who is one the Edison gold award in two thousand Eighteen and the brain innovations international award along with many others\nWere working global stress prevention and treatment and innovation and that would be touch points write that down so that you have it so you have a reference to know what we're talking about and with that let us welcome a doctor Amy Sarah and to the program good day to you Dr Sayre in\nAround\n... let's get right into the topic here you know we have discuss the topic of stress on this radio show many times and our audience is well aware\nThat stress is ...\nAnd our audience is well aware\nThat stresses insidious and it's pervasive and Seventy to eighty percent I read\nThis correct me if I'm wrong Dr Sayre and you're in the business of it Seventy to eighty percent of all doctor visits have some level of stress component associated with it whether it's a hang male or a headache or anything in between most people going into a doctor's office don't realize that the stress they're under physically mentally emotionally spiritually\nIs driving their health downward spin and they just don't know how to get out of it in your body may be expressing it in a certain way but there is that underlying simmering stress component that they're so\nThis topic is ... and you know we'll misunderstood in our society and how to treat it can you explain\nYou know a little bit about it and what your approach would be\nYes it is true when we think about all these ailments and everything that people are suffering with even a lack of sleep or physical issues we often don't look to stress as the culprit\nBut stresses inflammatory to our bodies and any time we're in a key state of stress that means in the moment stress we may not even realize it but it's just wreaking havoc on our health\nSo stresses really misunderstood and the ways we're managing it are very very old ways and we know they don't work because the minute your body get stressed out and your brain is stressed even if you don't know it\nYour body starts to inflame um there's all kinds of processes happening inside of it and what happens is your thinking brain actually starts shut down so it really doesn't make sense that we're telling people to you know stop try to take deep breaths\nWe can take deep breaths and moments that were not stress but immediately when we have this stress which go on in our bodies all of our thinking and our ability to try to control it actually goes out the window\nFortunately new neuroscience can actually help divert the body's stress response in real time and that was part of my exciting discovery\nI don't I Would be happy if it were just that where people were told to take a deep breath but that's not what happens people were told to take a pill is what they're older they don't do well by the\nTrue too yeah and um and you know we really don't want to invade the body with anything that's going to have side effects we always want to go to you know natural fast acting solutions before we do that\nUm we get a lot of people entering clinics that are on pills for anxiety and fortunately we're effectively able to get them off with some of these other methods one of them being the touch point\nWell our goal here on the show is to point out some people look okay so you've got stress or whatever that origin came from you know what you made that you created that between your ears it's the perception of stresses the reality that goes on between you're\nA real or otherwise and you know what you can create it did you do that and so we try to impart that\nSo that we tell people that if you can create it you can on wind that to you just haven't been given permission or you haven't been given the tools are you having been given the instruction of it and that's essentially I guess what you're trying to do as well correct\nYeah you know people live there's a difference between stressors and stress stressors are the things that are happening outside of me and then stresses my body's reaction to it and sometimes just our belief systems are a problem people thinking well you know if I got to see on a test I must be upset about it but somebody else gets to see on a test and they were expecting enough\nThey might be quite happy about it stress is your personal in the moment response to whatever's happening around you or whatever you're thinking\nSo if you change the overall quality of your thoughts your stress levels in general will go down but none of us are immune to fluctuations in stress and that every moment and and that's why I called the stress which\nBecause what's happening is allowed sound or a district serving thought or be reminded of something in your life that isn't going well all of those things can set the stress switch off and it's actually not a conscious network that's doing this the networks in your brain that are controlling it are very very\nHard wired primitive network that we are not in conscious control of\nIt doesn't make sense for us to and every moment try to consciously control this\nThis is why the narrow science tech technology in touch points is actually going to deny that stress switched down for you as you go about your day you don't actually even need to stop what you're doing and certainly you should stop what you're doing and sometimes and do healthy behaviors and have a base\nOf healthy behaviors like good sleep and exercise and nutrition but on top of that we are so stressed out as a culture that we need to go to and you can use this technology to be your go to any moment that you're experiencing dress\nWell do you deal with a lot of people and you know do you think our society today let's say versus ten years ago or Twenty years ago is more stress than ever\nOur society is a very stressed out the American Psychological Association polls are very clear and we actually have a database of over ten thousand individuals and we're tracking their stress\nAnd we're finding that over fifty percent of Americans are overwhelmed with stress and there's some other interesting findings and teens teens are actually more likely to be angry or very un focused when they're stressed out\nAnd do you want to know the most stressed out group in America\nWomen ages thirty five to forty four and that makes sense to me you know they're running families many of them have careers do you want to know the least stressed out group in America and the good news for you Dr Bob it's men heat is fifty six cent above or the leaf stressed\nOut hey wait a minute I just turned forty six the other day well not really but All right I'm going I'm going to have you know I'm going to have you hold\nYour thought right there Dr Sayre and when we come back I Want to get into the air you mentioned touch points when I talk about this amazing wearable technology and how that could help\nOur response distress were not taught how to deal with that were growing up we just overreact to it mostly and then wonder how to get out of it and a lot of people Dr Sharon let's face it use everything from alcohol to cigarettes to marijuana illicit listen drugs to de stress or on wind\nSo described to the audience looking at the device the touch points device what it looks like and what they would expect should they attempt to reduce their stress by Seventy percent and who wouldn't want that in thirty seconds everybody has stressed\nThat touch points are two devices and in order to divert the body's stress response one needs to be worn on each side of the body so they come with risk than than their small square they look sort of like an apple watch\nAnd you can wear them on your rent in your pocket and your stock or even hold them in your hand since they were very quickly some people just put them in their hands and then when they feel better they turn them off\nAnd they synchronized with each other so that they're they're written that there to visit him to the the gentle vibration and this is what diverts the body's stress response\nSo they're very very easy to where in fact um we have a lot of medical students now speaking of your psychiatry days or putting them in their thoughts and keeping them on when they're taking their boards because we now ...\nIs a huge issue and um what medical student and what many student you know doesn't have a lot of stress and they wish they could stay calm cool and collected in a situation\nVery quiet and they're able to to the war in without any ah any detection so a lot of people are wearing them at work\nTo get through stressful times or even sometimes all day and there's a lot\nOf autistic children and children with other difficulties that are wearing them all day at school because it seems to help them and not go into that sort of sensory overload and get overwhelmed and go into a fight or flight you were talking about the fight or flight response which which

granddaughter skits surgery or endometriosis barely rather than a family that just one day when I can get for her\nOkay the first thing that you have to do it ... treated hundreds of cases of injury trio says and what she has to do and she has to quit using\nUh these uh\n... uh the products that go inside of her uh can't think of the name of them right now but they're stuck up\nTampons that's it or if she's using those that as a fast path to enter matriarchal says\nAnd once you start using pads and I know that the young girls young women do not like to do this because they think well then there's going to be some older and I'll have to hassle and it'll be in my underwear may show I get that but\nWhen you do it are tampax or anything else it's stuck inside the vegetable canal that causes this just that'd be like sticking a plug\nUp your but your rear end to not have diarrhea that won't work either and that will cause cramping of your ball because you're going against the flow wanting to get out\nSo the number one cause of injury also started these tampax number one and once I've had so many women who changed over to the pads and their ... over time got better that's number one number two\nThese same women who have any major roses usually have some pretty heavy nutritional deficiencies that they suffer from that include the vitamins\nAnd usually if you look at what they're doing in their lifestyle they're eating a lot of junk food a lot of sugar they're ... they're down at Starbucks getting ten twelve teaspoons of sugar in their latte or they're deficient in these nutrients\nAnd they don't take in their diet the right kind of oils there on all these inflammatory fats that they're eating because they're eating a at the fast food places and getting all these inflammatory fats which just add to the inflammation that they're having that's helping to drive the ... so we got to get them away from the good\nGet them on the good fats like the omega fats and prim rose oil and away from all the other fats like safflower sunflower canola oil those kinds of fats they use these things industrial early\nIn the fast food industry and it just throws out of balance our own uh essential fatty acids and creates this inflammatory response and there's a ton of herbs Sally like ... why\nAnd chase bury that we have used for women who have menstrual cramps because Mr cramps are really the heart of this problem\nAnd once you solved the mystery of crap problem by solving the nutritional problem the lifestyle issue you teach them that uh they can go to\nIt's solving the nutritional problem the lifestyle issue you teach them that uh they can go to an acupuncture is to get relief for ... acupuncture is highly effective for enemies ...\nAnd if she continues to go down the medical path they are going to talk her out of her uterus they're going to take her uterus and while they're in there that will take her ovaries and she will be from that point forward wrecked\nFrom my sexual standpoint because we know that the uterus is or gas Mick just ask women who have had a hysterectomy and ask them what's your sex life like now that you've lost your uterus\nWell if they admitted to you they'll tell you there's just not like it was before so this is a very slippery path to go down in the medical pathway do not know how to treat ... says and it's one of the worst places to be if a woman has ... under the care of medical uh therapies\nEven though that\nThere is some of that may be growing out side of the uterus the\nAlthough you know and that's that's what that's what intimate drills this is the tissue eventually invades the abdominal cavity and once you take\nBut once you get rid of the reason it all starts shrinking back and coming back to normal\nNow I Know I understand the whole theory that's how they motivating scare women all you know all these issues is just you know it's like a it's like a parasite growing inside you\nWell let's just take it all out that doesn't solve the reason for the ... so she's still going to have problems if she continues to use the ... and has all these nutritional imbalances\n\nGreat but against her choice if she wants if she wants to go in and have the whole thing shelled out let her have it\nIt's not going to solve a problem or hormone problems are not going to go away they'll just manifest themselves in another way later on breast slumps a ovarian ... I mean it's just going to just continue down that path way because nothing is being solved\nDo their Sally\nYes I Am writing and writing down\nOr have her go back and listen to the pod cast of this\nWill be in the podcast library on demand a as a Wednesday and if she has a good sense about her and with your love and care are encouraging her to get a second and third opinion not just a rehash of the first\nUh then maybe she can save her uterus and not have to have invasive surgery which involves a general anesthesia by the way and general anesthesia\nWill generate a risk of one and Fifteen hundred people dying in another itself not to mention the complications the scar tissue I mean we you know I'm not here to scare you or her I'm here to tell you\nThat my experience teaches me as a doctor that's been a doctor for over forty years and I've seen many cases ... can be handled in almost every case there's always going to be that road case it's got you know so much to issue that's a migrated outside the abdomen\nThat you know there are so far gone yeah maybe there's that that case but in hers why not try and conservative approach first before going out and hunting and shelling out the whole system\nYeah I Know he didn't tell the truth\nWell that's the way I Believe you know that's what the show is about and I I you know again I I respect doctors who do these surgeries but most of them are unnecessary but it is but unless you have another option people are going to go down that slippery slope she's got plenty of options in it her young age\nThis should be able to be turned around or Sally there was very nice of you to call on her behalf alright next up we say hello to Carol she's calling from Little Rock books carols gone\nA so oh let's go over to a a

I guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home\nSo with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and its competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection and then they will make a firm offered to you\nTo buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month\nCan be quicker but they just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent\nOr so let's say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth\nTwo hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going to the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems where they can properly price a house\nCat it I'm dressed up however they need to and the landscaping or inside and get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent\nAnd having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to stand the test of time the market will decide but when you get out of it is you're just die if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out\nNo questions no ifs you know you're done\nYou don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like\nThat I see\nOkay and you also have to decide the price that you were offered\nDo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nOkay that makes ... yes\nYes it does I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were\nTotally totally legit no\nDoubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so with these companies when they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell and then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis\nOn the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of uh subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses because they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that but it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi Clark how're you doing stuff that\nCorporate thank you Tom how can that be of service\n[laughter] well out here and a half ago I got us less safe in the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought\nAbout a year and a half ago I got us will stay so the mail for a\nCredit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this 'cause I never hurts to have a backup card case you need it\nSo I I when I got the cars started using it because it actually had a better cash back more than the one I was using previous life so that when we go along fine one afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a mine so I called 'em\nSock stuff's card milk sent me a new one the whole smear at that point to sue the cart into the to my file and started using my original heart a GM\nAnd at last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I call them that went to the old and so they sent me a new card and then it happened again and also for the times has happened to spend a different addressed if a male and the new car too\nSo I talk to the company and they sent me on the frog department and the whole thing\nI did ask them I said no other cars I have for a second level security where they would ask you a question like you know who's your favorite rock group were bowlers are all your elementary school\nWho is your art rock group called the purple okay now I Know the code to get any of your credit [laughter] I'm not that one [laughter]\nBut it's an all or they said that they they they gave me some lame excuse to say well people can guess that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security they should offer\nAn issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the current issue or may not care as much with a business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections that a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act that was passed after the banking scandals so the Congress carved out\nThe exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example\nLet's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges\nOn your car and if they were successful you are able to take it over and run up charges the credit card company with a business card can say oh well we don't think that you Tom took good precautions\nAnd so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card for business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card\nAnd just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so is it less course apps and then there's this does have this account close you know\nIf you've been hit three times by people attempting to take over the account and divert the bills so that you don't know that false charges are being made I Would say three strikes and they're out\nSomebody has somehow figured out how to crack in on your particular card and who knows how many others and I don't want you vulnerable since you don't have\nThe normal slate of consumer protections but you can get any consumer card and just as a practical matter pay for it from your business\nIs also the cause of needs to be in the business and them go oh\nYou're liable anyway you know when you get a business card you know the ... one of the things you scientists you're personally liable\nAnd I approve this message paid for by maverick

how slow is going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you rent you know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay how can a day for the business\nI'm a combination of a sudden some cash and some some alone time so it would be and that Santa franchises as they're out we're going to go and then um we have a twenty percent down saved away for the home if we need to delay we sure can\nYeah I was literally I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be casual positive and how many months do they tell you\nI promise anything they show is their best guy their worst guy in their average guy and and I and even their worst guy would be okay with us\nOkay All right well that's good I I and ... either you you say we as you and your husband are going to get on the U.S have either of you worked in the industry before that you're going to have this franchise\n[noise] we have not\nSo I'm just all a stop signs and red lights right now I'm a big fan\nOf one of you going to work for one of the franchise is doing anything and everything for at least three months mhm\nBecause you got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really like for you to uh experience to one or both of you to experience the business before you're all done\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk\nYou there's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time that of lemonade or issues concerns mistakes you might make once you're owning a map parading it\nYeah that makes sense\nSo I put your whole life on hold but you wanted to talk to about\nOkay well um you know I respect your opinion and I thank you so much for your advice\nSure and I wanted to ask you one thing before you go the borrowing you're going to do you said SPA maybe\nThat's what we were thinking\nThat he would Dennis ... small local bank that you can go talk about your plans with\nFor not ... not yet no cataract recommendation\nWell that's just what I Want you to be about as I Want you out there talking to the there aren't as many small local banks as they used to be a lot of them look like they're local really are just pretending and there are parts of bigger operations you want to a bank that you can grow with\nAnd that specializes has people on staff that really know the SBA loan program and I would get out there and and start interviewing bankers you interviewed\nThem like you were interviewing them for a job not like you're going hat in hand and saying rooster ms banker you want to blend us money you know you want to interview the banker and decide who it is you're comfortable working with and essentially being in business with\nThat climate is with us on the Clark Howard show did I get your name right\nYes hello clerk Hi great to have you here\nThank you for what you do for the American consumer\nWhile you're trying to say that how can I serve you as an American consumer\nWell thank you are a lot of people are going to find my question humorous but I run a thriving waterfront vacation rental in North central Florida and because it sleeps Eighteen or more people I find myself find lots of paper towels and toilet paper\nWow you have a single rental that people use it\nWow you have a single rental people use as a party house with how many people are\nCan do that it's a collection of all Florida buildings that lake water like a waterfront calm how\n'bout that that's pretty cool\nThat is neat and so just things like a consumer bowls are eating up into some of your profit\n... yes and I don't know whether to go to a local thing box store or perhaps to an online a purveyor of the paper\nI Believe you're going to catch or a bad deal for time with the Sam's Club and Costco Wholesale excellent and you know both of them have institutional supplies are you familiar with Cosco has the business centers\nYeah as a likely candidate or the wholesale club [noise] and I just did not know what to think of that\nBecause the business centres specifically deal with um a owner operators of small motels I sell 'em you know a facial tissue\nAnd private label and huge box quantities you know where you have the size of the individual boxes are smaller but they send you a big quantities one time huge amounts of toilet paper all those kinda things Sam's Club but if you join their premium membership\nHas a delivery service were you and I don't even have to go get it they deliver for free\nAnd when they have a periodic sales they will deliver to you and Sam's Club also as a corporate a sibling oh gee I\nAnd a lot of people who ran a or B and be used and things like that by the consumer balls on dot com\nFor that interaction I Will look into all of those options\nSo the good thing which there is no annual membership fee Samson Costco both of them you have a membership so\nThat's why a lot of people with a air being bees use because it's like what they feel are really good prices but they don't have any membership for you they have to pay\nAn

Bloomberg Businessweek over the next couple of hours we're gonna bring you knew the week inside some of the magazine and so much\nMore in this week's broadcaster we really do all over the world starting in China they have their own version of space\nSector yeah love that the billionaires club of Ilan mosque jak basis and Richard Branson kind of facing some competition also I Love the story I Know you kind of making fun of me because I Do but we take a look and how big tech is scared I'm about the clouds backup system uh reels of magnetic tape kind of at risk it's a patent\nWar I Do like the story but I also like making fun of it we also look at markets which were no laughing matter last week as they limited for a couple of days been bounced back pretty dramatically we dig into what's going on there\nPlus you've got a special focus on retail including a look at Amazon's push Emily Wal Mart's push also into India is this week's cover story but first [noise]\n\n[noise]\nOkay well that's clearly an ad from a happier time for years a few tough years for the big retail I mean a company that effectively defined how we shop for much of the last century\nIt's amazing because he was finally finally filing for bankruptcy and it's interesting because the stir it really takes a look at why CEO investor billionaire a Eddie lamprey he really couldn't keep this one time retail giant afloat we get more from Kathy Britain thing going on for a long time people\nHave described this as the liquidation over a decade and if you talk to younger people they they always the first thing they said was isn't Sears already then ...\nWhat happened because back\nThirteen Years right Eddie lamp bird um got involved in the ears right around Thirteen Years ago he merged Kmart with Sears at that time and everybody thought it was a smart idea I think\nI think initially initially they did because uh there was a lot of cash flow coming out as Kmart came out of bankruptcy they pots hears a there was a lot of cash cut costs and said the stocks really went crazy so he looked very smart in the beginning\nIt's interesting to take a step back from um because I Do love how you start your story you say bit by bit the smart money deserted Lambert tell us a little bit about\nWhy he used to do in terms of investments how big is fun was who was invested with him and then who kind of left him\nOf retail via department stores and malls and then big discount stores like Wal Mart never really happened there I mean there's some\nModerate sized players but um\nI don't know for whatever reason you know and and probably it having to do with legal structure is a very cash based economy in poverty it didn't happen now you know but there are very cosmopolitan populations in the major cities and that's where Amazon starting a and work flickered started now ten years ago flip card you know to start up\nA founded by former Amazon engineers actually who started selling books or I tried to copy the Jeff Bezos recipe a and and proved that there was a market and then now well let's see about five years ago Amazon came in and they really started competing head to head\nYou know fueled by this you know amazing capital market\nFlip cart was able to raise a lot of money from softbank and a tiger global and other companies and you know it was her off to the races Amazon might have been as well right at one point well so what happened was right flip card was uh was independent Amazon started investing slip card started to wobble\nLittle bit um they had to take a down round they raise money from your Microsoft an e bay [noise] um and then uh Amazon actually started to talk to to flip card with these secret talks so we report about it in the story and Wal Mart got wind of that Wal Mart had talked about investing and flip cart in the past but it never happened\nAnd then they started bidding against each other and and the value of flip Kirk went from eleven to twenty billion wow and we're recording the story that Amazon made the higher offer which I think all surprised a lot of people but the flip cardboard including softbank\nA went with the Walmart offer because they thought it would be easier to do more efficient they wouldn't have the anti trust her view right which Amazon Amazon guys were sort of confident they can get past\nSpots slipped card sold the Wal Mart a duck like Bill and the Walmart CEO went and visited flip card gave a pep talk and now you know as we speak a bus companies are in their big holiday period ... coming in India and their paper in the whole country with this Christ\nSo you mentioned sort of regulatory from an antitrust perspective there is a regulatory aspect to this that makes this a lot more complicated for both of these companies tell us about that\nThe Indian government you know like like other governments pay places restrictions on what foreign owned entities can do they're trying to protect small businesses so a foreign owned entity\nA can that wants to sell multiple brands cannot sell directly to customers they have to be kinda wholesalers\nSo at Amazon does is it sets up a marketplace like at ... half of its business in the U. S. where other sellers can go in and sell things so they've had to go and like teach you know give away free chai tea and teach people how to sell on Amazon would they also doing this too is they invested in third parties kind of quietly\nTo go and be big sellers on their side so they can guarantee inventory and there are some proposed new rules that would clamp down on that and you know they'll have to adjust\nWell that I mean yeah I mean is there the risk that they will be forced out of the country\nYou know there is a risky you'd never know what the governmental do but I ... I think we can say pretty confidently that these companies also wields political influence um you know they have relationships you know what the prime minister and they're spending money they're spending money and so I think probably they will be voices at the table in forging new rules\nIn addition on the other side you've got big players like reliance on to local retailer they're run by the wealthiest man in India or probably lobbying to make the rules so restrictive that Amazon and Wal Mart or I have a hard time\nSo you among others you've probably more than anybody else understand how Amazon worked here we know is customers or what it's like but you went to India tell us about the customer experience on the ground 'cause it's very different than you know a sitting in our comfortable homes and like sort of\nCourse at Mount an eye pad and showing up the next day right and this surprised me because the Amazon around the world kind of takes away the intermediary and in India they do things differently I think they understood that they would have to train people to use e commerce and get and get trust\nAnd so they work with store owners in rural villages and\nThese kinds of shipping stores in big cities where you can go in their screens and people will help you search or Amazon dot I. N. and and the product will be delivered there to the store and then you go pay cash and pick it up so really a different experience and you know my colleagues ... who I worked in the story with\nYou know I could never have done this because everyone's speaking you know different language and uh you know they're twelve different languages in Indian cheap somehow she speaks all of them are ... seemed to me and so we're going around and she's showing me how basically Amazon has empowered\nThis whole ecosystem of intermediaries instead of taking them away to go and be kind of emissary ... e commerce and indeed\nHow important is India ultimately to Amazon how important is it to Walmart in terms of its future success\nYou know there I think the the best answer to that is the ... they're placing on it so Wal Mart box look card for sixteen billion dollars you know Jeff Bezos has written to like big checks ah one for literally there were like over ... ...\nLike big checks or one for literally there were like oversized\n... one of the New York where he wanted to do it on an elephant and fourteen my bank and they couldn't get one because all the time for you so they did on truck they were used for religious ... surprised I was older and you have a great quote and there's like a God is only slightly more and more of a job um\nAnd you know so to ... three billion check their internal international law says last year you go look at that number most of that was India for Amazon so they're spending a lot of money I mean I think it's seen as like the last big piece on the map that's still up for grabs\nSo I think Amazon wants to continue this thirty percent growth rate into the future you know and so this was one way in which they can continue to feel\nTheir growth great stuff Brad thanks thanks God thank you you're listening to Bloomberg Businessweek coming up a brutal legal battle between ... and ... film has IBM H.
