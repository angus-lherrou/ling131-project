Bush administration\nLate in the administration uh and\nThen the Clinton Administration inherited it so that's why in late Ninety three the U.S is still involved with special forces in operations the movie Black Hawk down is telling a Hollywood telling of the first battle of Mogadishu bill Roadshow and Tom just wonder here so we note\nThat we've been fighting in and around Mogadishu for twenty five years at least twenty six twenty seven years have you stretch back to the early days of the u._s. landing in Somalia bill the Italians\nWho struck some in Mogadishu what is the expectation\nAnd Italian a unit of part of the European in Somalia was it in a in a district in Mogadishu with ... suicide bombers live is al ... as you know twenty five plus or to just about twenty five years later\nYou know al ... continues to haunt us on the west\nIn Somalia and ... and ... title was involved in the black Hawk Down incident Mohammed ...\nWho he was killed in two thousand and one he was involved in all kinds of military leader he was in Mogadishu\nUh with some other kind of trainers and they instructed\nThe tribesmen who were fighting us during the black Hawk Down incident on how to hit the U.S helicopters to hit them in the ... the the Blackhawks and the the rotor the tail rotor and that's what brought them down and cause you know the\nThe the mail a and that lasted ... days in the city so you know we continue to fight allocated to this day\nTo Bob in its branch there as we noted earlier\nThey are they the Shabaab likes to use suicide attacks against everyone and anyone that he can uh it it had a a ... in Somalia is one of the\nWe were the first I Believe there's two or three American suicide bombers um that have conducted attacks Somali that's for the first American suicide bomber enough that it's attacking and and I believe you hit a un compound a couple of years ago and killed dozens of people\nAnd so the Italian operation was struck by the Shabaab a operation do we operate just quickly bill do we operate forces on the ground in Mogadishu absolutely\nThe U.S special forces partner up with African Union and Somali horses and when we launch airstrikes often it's because we engage with Shabaab in there's heavy combat and airstrikes hurting bailout um our forces to this is the partner forces there\nYes the long war we think it's Afghanistan no Somalia twenty five years and counting job you know that Mogadishu this the Shabaab still mention a county when they when they were a member of their origins\nYeah you know it's still not really understood a John but one of things we have to document all the time is the fact that Shabaab and other groups like them around the world have adopted the kind of program all the way through and this includes all sorts of\nDifferent operational I'm sort of a strategies and tactics right down to the ideology and sort of the playbook there for who they are going to reference as sort of key ideological figures and in their thinking and how they look at the world in ... and the county is certainly one of them\nUm you know Shabaab has referenced the economy's in their propaganda and the tall bond as well a number of times and this is this is just not something we find to be uncommon with a lot of these groups\nAnd it's one of the one of the indicators that we look at to show how these groups are in fact I'll kite or part of all kinda\nWe go to a vase the attack on a military parade many wounded many dead and last week when we discussed this there were videos provided by the attackers of the martyrs in the operation but it's in much dispute these last days by Tehran\nThat the attackers were ISIS a mock news agency put an announcement out by the time you tell me their airstrikes launched by the Iranians in Syria that seem to be a coincidental\nWell the Iranians struck Islamic state targets in eastern Syria as response for what happened in Nevada that's attached to the mission by the Iranians that despite all the bluster they know that it was in fact the Islamic state that carried out the attack\nThe Iranians for their own reasons and their own interests are very keen to blame anything on the Saudis the Americans Israelis there's a whole laundry list of sort of actors that they try and point the finger at but the bottom line is that there's there was early on after this attack was already evidence that it was the Islamic state not dispositive\nNot foolproof but there were strong evidence that it was the Islamic state and that evidence I Would say in my judgment has gotten only stronger over time including with these airstrikes by the Iranians which as I said it's sort of a tacit admission that they think the Islamic state did but John in the last\n... seconds go ahead and tell him he said\nEven released a very special message from its spokesman counting the attack and I bought it and that's not the type of thing they do unless they really mean that they did it Tom just\nBuild roads you they are senior fellow and the foundation for the defense of democracy they keep the long war journal not just Afghanistan but back to Somalia twenty five years now I'm John bachelor [noise]\n\nStanding by his man I'm Lisa ... Fox News President Trump continued to defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a rally in Tennessee ... more has more line we\nSaid the president says Democrats are grasping at straws to find skeletons and Brett Kavanaugh's closet [noise]\nGreat great and never had a problem with all of a sudden oh let's go back to school said maybe she go before high school\nAnd he says they want us back to the Supreme Court with liberal justices\nLeft wing judges who will rewrite the law and replace your values you don't want that agenda as the Senate\nMajority leader Mitch McConnell says the chamber will vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation this week at least\nWell it certainly does um because you've got a lot of very arrogant flag officers in China right now and they're really itching for a fight they've got all this new equipment they think they're both they think that we're in terminal declined\nAnd you know all the rest of it plus if you add in what John was referring to in the beginning you got to see June paying who basically maybe thinks he's got a closing window of opportunity to deal with us\nBecause he's concerned about his economy has got to be concerned about other things this is a very good time to take the United states on so that's why you know people talk about a quote unquote decade of concern I think that it's a maybe a couple of years of concern and those couple of years Thaddeus there right now\nThe Chinese ministry of defense complained that dictator violated Chinese saw China's sovereignty no Vietnam in ... Taiwan also claim this badly islands Gordon\nDoes they destroy our captain make a decision on his own to come this close to ... I mean all they can it totally dominates the area\nOr they're dealing with a super warship and its wired into our network so it's not alone out there to that destroying a captain the P L A navy started captain make the decision on the spot or we see under orders is he talking to Beijing when he does\nYeah I'd be really really really surprised if the Chinese captain was making decisions on his own because that's not the way the Chinese military works\nIn addition to all the chain of command issues because for instance our captain was not making decisions on his own but you know in China is much more tightly controlled you've got political officers at all levels in the military so these decisions were being made back in ... during a at extremely high level\nFatty mean you mentioned in our camp grooms acting under orders to can you explain that\nThis is the freedom of navigation operation these are not planned by the commander of a ship these are plan not even at the level of seven fleet or I think that we're talking about\n... of the commander of the Indo Pacific region which would be Honolulu and probably even up further up the change to the chief of naval operations the top admiral\nAnd indeed I I wouldn't be surprised if the president himself were generally if prize\nOf what the navy was going to do maybe not on a specific um pass by like this one but in general what the plan was so clearly this politically sensitive on both sides and you're not going to have decisions being made at the lowest levels\nA detail garden we're told within these last hours that secretary mad as you will not make a trip to China a it's a little unclear whether there was a trip planned and they called it off or whether they were planning and they just decided not to go forward\nDo you find any significance Gordon given Mr Madison's last visit where there were a sharp words that the Chinese are no longer talking ...\nYeah well this is significant you know there were going to be a meeting um they had maybe specifically a ... a set the time but they were definitely going to have it because this was part of an established dialogue\nAnd what happened is the Chinese said that um Secretary Mattis is counterpart was not going to be available so of course the Pentagon I'm no called off that trip\nYou know this is one of those cases where you've you've got the Chinese throwing a temper tantrum is in their interest to have these milk Tamil exchanges and they're calling them off because they're upset about one thing or another and we're seeing this temper tantrum play out it's like you've got sucks in Beijing who are now acting like three year olds\nThat status you know doing so what is Madison now when the when the he his counterpart is available or does he accepted\nMeeting does he know where does he said well you know I might not be available now myself\nI that that's a great question Thaddeus and that decision is not going to be made by Mattis that's going to be made um maybe by the president in consultation with his senior White house staff\nUm you know clearly I think that the administration should say look you know we're not just not available for meetings with you until you guys decide to act responsibly that would be my response unfortunately that's not the way people in Washington think\nPeople in Washington thing that you've got to have engagement you got to have these contacts\nAnd so therefore they peered desperate to the Chinese to have\nThese discussions these discussions do produce anything except we produce a lot of carbon as we fly over to Beijing are they fly here for really no purpose at all the Chinese are not willing to talk they are not willing to act responsibly I just don't see the point of talking to the\nCourt and this is a question because you do a great deal of Congress have a great deal of conversations with major media figures and you travel\nHave we passed a point guard and where the relationship is broken and we how are we past that now are we are I Know we're very well informed this audience is very well informed China but I Can't tell whether they're still dealing with that there's still some sense that we can repair this I Can't tell\nIf we can repair John but we shouldn't try to repair it because we appear to desperate in the past\nFor like you know what the you know the past where ongoing\nYeah I think the Chinese right now are not willing to talk so I don't see this being repaired um because we're not going to make the effort they're not going to make the effort we have got to raise all sorts of issues of their objectionable conduct they're going to react badly to this\nSo I don't see that we're going to have good relations as people to find good for a very long time\nI think the relations are going to be good because good is getting what you want good is standing up for your principles we haven't done that for very long time John and you know people can complain a lot about this president but he's doing the right thing with regard to China and we need to support him\nLater on this evening I Will have a conversation with captain Jerry Hendricks US Navy aviator retired\nWe will talk about the shape of the navy for the immediate future\nThat's what we're talking trouble\nDiplomacy trouble\nWe're talking about trouble\nSoft diplomacy

what does it look like joining us now the former congressman from Ohio here on America Tonight with me Kate ... now with talk media news\nBob this is big that NAFTA first of all I'm finally comes about because you know look like Trudeau and Canada was really stuck in this and that they weren't going to agree but something changed right\nThat's right ... it's called a new NAFTA and\nIt's like the YMCA or something [laughter]\nBut it's a it's a great deal I mean when Trump said he would do this he would renegotiate it for twenty five years everybody's saying we've got to do something [laughter]\nYeah yeah you know you look at the new deal and there's the requirements that cars trucks imported from Mexico and Canada have to qualify for duty free access that's one of the thing uh uh they have to be manufactured with Seventy five percent component from\nThat's one of the things uh uh they have to be manufactured with Seventy five percent component from three the three countries that huge also that the work that's done sixteen dollars per hour for labor so that means that I'm Mexican companies are going to have to raise wages that is a very big deal\nThat is because you know our problem for example in China is they they have slave labor basically you know and people were twenty eight days\nA month or practically nothing we can kind of care how productive we can't compete when you something like this provision that we're suppose it's great for human beings and on top of it it's it's great for us it balances things out dairy farmers of course when maybe some other people in in the process with commodities\nBut yeah I I'm just viewing this people are trying to be skeptical it is something that people have been promising to do for almost a quarter century and he's done it a fantastic\nYeah ... years you cannot take that away from Donald Trump absolutely a hundred percent agree with you that happens that the big moment and then when I'm Donald Trump is doing a press conference for it it turns toward cabin I started getting asked\nQuestions about that and really at first didn't want to talk about it then he starts to kind of you know kind of hidden ... about the the Kavanaugh singing and Trump said look I'm fine with the FBI interviewing Kevin I was a third accuser so he's saying do what they have to do he's he's basically\nPutting it back on um you know the Senate right\nShort one of the national media started to report that he told the FBI you could only talked to people cetera and I just I Can't be accurate and if it is the FBI would have to tell the Senate with the with the president told us\nHe said it can be comprehensive now people took the words where he said you know he also feels that it can be a fishing expedition where you could just go on for months with this thing or you know you could have\nFifty but not on this phone calls and do you you know investigate those types of things but I think in general we clearly said it it can be comprehensive the FBI you'll do it they take about a week so do you have a vote by friday I think\nFrank McCall kind of pushing the envelope maybe the FBI my comeback Thursday and say well we need a few more days I think we would have to you to that as a ... I would've\nAnd we know Kavanaugh denied that the New York times reported Monday that in September of Nineteen eighty five Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a bar where he was accused during ice in another patron\nThe time I went to a police report of that incident in New haven and said Kavanaugh was not arrested according to that report the victim indicates that after Kavanaugh hurled the ice a friend of his through a glass and hit the victim in the ear causing him to believe the man was treated a hospital\nAnd Kavanaugh speaking the officers didn't want to say if he threw the heights of or I'm not so this is what's happening every possible rock is being overturned former MBA player Chris deadly said he regular he drank with Kavanaugh wild with your classmates at Yale and said he never ever saw\nHim be a blackout drunk the but they drank a lot together so\nThis is going to go on probably at least for a couple more days and it depends on that whole vote thing when one of the vote going to go on or not because of McConnell's thing one thing and he's saying but then it's going to hold that vote\nThis week so if they hold the vote this week\nWell does that mean you know the end of the week or what does that mean and I guess they wrap up that investigation\nHe says it's time for the endless delaying obstruction is to come to a close he said judge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee were considering it here in the form will be voting this week he made the comment McConnell did\nWho in the Senate majority leader during the Senate floor speech and this comes as the FBI has to wrap this up\nThough and you know listen they got to wrap this up by friday so I guess they could vote friday or go into the week the Republican senators and aides have been careful not to pin down a specific timeline on the nomination and that's smart because how do they know what if the FBI wraps it up\nBefore the friday deadline what if they wrap it up Thursday whatever it is so\nIf McConnell file coach or be forced to hear something so McConnell waited until friday to file cloture on the nomination that would set up an initial vote on ending debate as early Sunday\nIf he filed closure before that he could bring up the vote as soon as the friday deadline passed or when the FBI wrapped it up so they're playing the waiting game that's what they have to do so far what we do know is senator Collins and Senator Murkowski or undecided\nAnd Jeff Flake\nSaid he he would support cabinet but he was key to getting that one week investigation into the allegations he said every week and expects to support him unless the FBI\nIt ... into the allegations\nHe said every week and expects to support him unless the FBI find something in the investigation so it really rats I guess on this investigation\nAnd um is it going to uncover something that's a definite definite some things that they can now with that whole evidence thing\nBecause I I think that's where they're going to go with this so if you flip a coin and give it a little better odds I'd say you know what I'd say because everybody's pressing me on this too I Would say it's sixty forty sixty ... confirmed\nForty not it's just\nYou know it's just too close to close to say what happens in the case of flake especially because he would be really going to call the swing vote he would be the swing vote if you look the numbers\nAnd so therefore unless somebody else decide the ninth hour to go in a different direction but it's a very very unlikely I called this segment odds and ends because there's so much we don't get to talk to talk about rather on America Tonight and by the way you can always\nJam in on the conversation when ever you want a five five to six six fifty two eighty three let me flip out the dead the digits against eight five five to six six fifty two eighty three so I Love that I mean I got to give some applause to this\nTo me weeks ahead of Halloween 'cause you know already as the Halloween decorations all over the place it's it officially ... then what Thanksgiving and Christmas the whole holiday thing\nBut check this out you know help Black Friday is always so big\nAnd people are leaving um\nHouses to go stand in line overnight after they eat their Thanksgiving dinner because they get these incredible buys and if they're the first person in the door they get a a giant flat screen TV for five dollars or whatever it is and they always and it's kind of crazy deals they have but they don't tell you there's only like three of them available so\nI'm On Black Friday is a list came out on Monday of sixty stores that are not going to open\n\nOn Thanksgiving and I say bravo to that Cosco ikea Sam's Club Home Depot Lowe's they're pretty big stores there saying nope they're gonna they're gonna keep them close because then their employees would have off\nA game stop open on Thanksgiving for the first time and she's twenty seven teams Stein Mart and shoot carnival close after\nBeing open in previous years so there's a list\nOf huge retailers that are balking on that whole idea of the special\nAnd I think for them because they know they have competition Amazon is crushing everybody with the crazy delivery the costs like you know hardly anything um and what they offer online and Jeff Bass is brilliant he's what he's like Dr evil taking over everything right and left\nOr doctor I don't know capitalists but that's the thing with Amazon get a look over your shoulder 'cause where they go in next\nAnd it's interesting\nIt it it's great that they're not doing that because why\nLet people have a break man let them have a break and maybe it's that there'll be gaming all night long and then they'll find that aggression cars and that was reading a story and it's actually it's not funny there's this international study looking into about Seventeen thousand adolescence too so kids nine\nTo nine teams they did for two years and they found that playing violent video games led to an increase in physical aggression overtime I mean I Wonder if you took another Seventeen thousand what did you find it at another Seventy\nNothing like we could always argue about results of any kind of\nUm a test but those are pretty big numbers and what this study showed and that they were from countries from ah the U.S Canada kids U.S Canada Germany Japan so like grand theft auto call of duty manhunt they say that\nWhat happened is you would that have this behavior that would be have the kids sent to the principal's office for fighting hitting a non ... family member you know that kind of thing I mean there's no there's compelling\nResponses and it's sad some of what was his name but there's no a hundred percent in anything we we know that I'm a video game violence is a hot button issue it has been for at least a decade\nRemember when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold the two teams who I'm committed at heinous crime at Columbine High school ... started shooting killed all those kids they they play that a computer games do\nThey talked about that and uh there was a ... two thousand eleven Supreme Court decision overturning California's ban on the sale of violent video games to minors\nThe late Justice Antonin Scalia dismissed the link between the games and aggression\n[laughter] you know the studies had been rejected by all the court to consider them and he said for good reason they don't prove that violent video games cause minors to act aggressively and I bet you can find evidence to refute that but the problem is that you can find evidence that would be contrary to that as as well\nUm you know remember\nWe can look at the end it's like a Rubik's Cube and turn it in a lot of different directions and I think it's sad if that happens I think it's awful if that happens and I and I think that's part of the problem is like too much bones too much\nNot interacting and I think is behavior\nThat changed so much in our world what about running around outside and blame\n\nOn the radio\nA B.

there's no question it is it was different I'm In the eighties than it is now\nBut luckily he didn't say that because\nThat wouldn't have come across well if he had said oh in the eighties was different and that's all we all got bombed and you know um that's what happened in ... you know you didn't sometimes things that shouldn't happen happen or whatever he didn't say that\nUh I don't know or are they going to have this this vote on friday is going to be before friday\nIt's again it's the mystery is that song goes the mystery at this point I'm going to move on from that because there's just so much of it the ... hours of the opinions of people out there and I'll do I'll keep going through them and whatnot as we move along but how about this one this was a late one\nFrom Monday and this one was from herb I've never emailed you before ms dilemma but I got to tell you and I I Know you will share my excitement [noise]\nHow about the fact that we have a NAFTA deal ladies and gentleman\nEverybody's got to give Trump credit for that I don't care if you were a lifelong liberal he said he was going to do it he did do it and I think it's a big damn deal what do you say\nI think it's a big deal of course it's a big deal because of so many reasons of what's in that NAFTA deal um he said he was going to do it and he did to it so there's new\nRequirements in the deal that would mean like for example in Mexico there's labor there gets what they gotta pay be paid sixteen bucks an hour for the people working there that are in sweat shop that's huge and then\nThe cars and trucks that come in from Mexico and Canada they have to qualify for duty free access\nThey have to be manufactured was Seventy five percent components from the three countries so that means that the labor so if you say oh well that means the law that labor is going to be done in Mexico that's not true it's has to be done spread across the board so that's a\nBoy that's so interesting and one of the things that Trump's that is without terrorists we wouldn't be talking about a deal\nWhich was what he said he's come under massive scrutiny and criticism for that but he impose these tariffs tariffs on imports from the U.S and the allies as a way to drive\nPeople to the bargaining table and that\nIt worked because number one all this was going on he said he would have no problem leaving candidate behind in Haiti and it was a twenty five percent tariffs on their auto experts exports if they weren't willing to make a deal by September thirtieth so they were put it in a really difficult position they made a deal\nAnd under the deal by the Trump does not have to remove the twenty five percent tariffs on steel and ten percent tariffs on aluminum from Canada and Mexico\nThey say they're two separate issues mhm it\nIs one of those moments that is a very very big moment we watch another one this one is from Billy\nPayne of emailed the show several times over the past year and I'm just kind of handicapping what happened in the United states than what what we're going to see and twenty twenty and\nAre the Democratic challengers going to have a leg up or are they not going to have a

content and the auto sector as well as um a a contender minimum content level of four twenty five percent yeah going strong factories with what could make sixteen dollars an hour or more\nSo now I think that perhaps the most interesting element of all of this is this day that business is going to accept it business is going to celebrate the fact that they now have legal status that and the bad investments can continue in the region\nAnd begging of work with the rule\nOf the of the new agreement to try to deepen the integration that we've already seen in America so I take it as a as a positive step forward\nIt's far from perfect doesn't agreement but which free trade agreement is right um and that you know one thing that I think that the you know when you read the attacks in great detail with finding that despite all the little irritants that are still there\nUm and some a precedent that have been set whichever uncomfortable for free trade is it's it's a step in the right\nDirection All right and one thing that I'm struggling with is does this agreement move more toward a freer trade with fewer barriers are more toward was sort of more protectionist approach and I'm thinking in particular the sixteen dollars an hour provision which will effectively either force Mexico to dramatically increase pay or else produce things in the U.S more\nYeah I mean that you you've identified one of the uh the the clearest ... all of a a a less free trade approach um and that you know I think that that's that that's the thing that will stand out for a for a lot of people\nUm we also have to recognize that the uh you know the new agreement doesn't result the problem is you have a section to study too on aluminum and steel\nUm it really resolve the dispute over the potential application inspection to study to on all the ultimate ... walk out of Mexico have calmed down\nI'm an exemption from that up to two point six million vehicles a year um that that they're still going to be subject to it which goes against the principles of free trade however you\nOn the positive side I Would say they always seen as we've seen a modernization and all of a of an agreement that uh you know it was more than two decades old that was considered to be an old lady a free trade agreement\nWe conclude eat meat issues though that a new agreement applies to areas they'll pitch to trade intellectual property you know there's some interesting work there on on financial services\nAnd says these are I mean it looks much more like a twenty first century a free trade agreement and the ... and I I Would say that that extend the reach of free trade in the American rage\nCan disagreement or parts of disagreement be used in future negotiations with China\nI think that's certainly um what's that what's behind a lot of the uh or at least some of the language in that\nI'm On the most healthiest a band out here is that is the question of currency manipulation there was no reason to include the medical Asian probation in a NAFTA because neither candidate know Mexico engage in that kind of behavior but clearly the United states wanted to establish the rest of the\nWeb by they take it language to any potential um a future free trade deal and you know the Japanese have already um stigma that they know about that they know that that's coming to that group and then it goes ... with the United states and of course they set the precedent for China in particular\nDuncan I'm struck by the fact that you I think that disagreement and be good for us energy companies can you explain\nYeah um I think that it is it's good for us energy companies look first of all in Mexico was excluded from the original uh provisions energy provision but now\nUm and uh you know it it it specifically required that it was excluded from the free trade calls or all of oil and gas [noise] um because Mexico system at the time was the closest that\nI'm In two thousand Fifteen Mexico has opened up at the when I go back to Mexico now has a a a market oriented um energy ... uh and that has been on this threat\nWith the uh with a new government was coming

[noise]\nHelp a veteran visit he'll that it's a\nTough one Veasey of radio\nTo set the stage let's return a for a moment to the situation facing the pharmacy the baseline forecast of most of pharmacy participants and a broad range of others\nShow unemployment remaining below four percent for an extended period with inflation steady near two percent\nAnd I've made the case that this forecast is not too good to be true and does not signal the death of the Oscar and said instead this outlook is consistent with evidence of a very flat Philips curve with inflation expectations anchored near two percent\nBut we still have to face the cautionary advice to be where one forecasts points\nBut we still have to face the cautionary advice to be where when forecasts point to rarely seen outcomes\nAnd as a way the heating this advice the committee takes a risk management approach which has three important parts monitoring risks balancing risks and contingent contingency planning for surprises so let me describe a few of the risks and how we're thinking about those today\nThe first is the risk that inflation expectations might lose their anchor we attribute a great deal of the stability of inflation in recent years to the anchoring of longer term inflation expectations and we're aware that it could be very costly if those expectations were to drift materially\nThis is slight six or as you probably know from our public communications we carefully monitored survey and market based proxies for expectations and we don't see evidence of material shifting longer term expectations survey measures have been ... ... the survey measures in particular have been studied for some time\nThe financial market based measures include both and expectations component and volatile inflation premium component so they tend to move around much more than the surveys but we don't see much evidence of material change in those measures either\n\nThe risks to inflation expectations are of course two sided until this summer inflation had remain stubbornly below two percent for a number of years\nAnd major economies in much of the world have been struggling mainly with this inflationary forces that we have been and will remain alert for possible downward drift in expectations\nSome argue the contrary case that by only gradually removing a combination of the unemployment rate has fallen the phone so you may fall or have fallen behind the curve thereby risking an upper drift in expectations\nFrom the standpoint of contingency planning or courses clear resolutely conduct policy consistent with our symmetric two percent inflation objective and stand ready to act with authority\nIf expectations dripped drift materially up or down\nA second rescue that labor market tighten us or tightness in other parts of the production Shane might lead to higher inflation pressure than expected call this The Revenge of the Philips curves scenario\nAs I mentioned [noise] if um see carefully monitors a wide array of early indicators of inflation pressure to evaluate this risk\nWages and compensation data or one important source of information and these measures have picked up some recently but in a way that is quite welcome specifically the rising wages is broadly consistent with observed rate of price inflation and labor productivity and therefore does not point to an overeating labor market\nFurther higher wage growth alone need not be inflationary the late Nineteen nineties episode of low unemployment so wages rising faster than inflation plus productivity growth without an appreciable rise inflation\nDespite what shows up in in the aggregate are waging compensation data However I'm sure that uh like like we are or many of you are hearing widespread anecdotes about labor shortages and increasing bottlenecks in production\nFor example as shown in figure seven the words shortage and bottleneck are increasingly appearing into beige book\nThe message we're hearing at our conversations is supported by a wide range of more conventional measures for example the NFL id member survey increasingly reports that\nA job openings are hard to fill further these businesses now list quality of labor as their most important problem as opposed to the much more typical reporter poor sales\n[noise] we review a wide variety of measures of this type and these indicators show what I think most business people see an economy operating with limited slack\nNotice however that these measures are near levels that prevailed in the late Nineteen nineties or really to thousands a period where as I mentioned corn inflation remained under two percent\nWhile the late nineties case proved that elevated values of these tightened its measures do not automatically translate into rising inflation a single episode provides only limited reassurance\nPlus we take seriously the possibility that tight markets for labor or other inputs could provide greater upward pressure on inflation than a scene in the baseline outlook\nOur best estimates however suggest that as long as inflation expectations remain anchored a modest deepening of the Philips gr would be unlikely to cause a significant rise in inflation or demanded disruptive policy tightening once again the key is anchored expectations\n\nA third risk in this case essentially an upside risk is that the natural rate of unemployment could be even lower than current estimates some of argue that the fed should be removing policy a combination much more slowly or not at all uh pushing the economy to see if the natural rate of unemployment is lower still\nAdvocates of this view note that over the past several years of policy normalization economy has continued to strengthen and unemployment has fallen fallen but inflation has remained quiet\nAs I discussed in a recent speech many analysts have accounted for the lack of rising inflation pressure by lowering their estimate of the natural rate\nFor example uh uh just since the story of two thousand and sixteen the unemployment rate is falling about percentage point and estimates of the natural read by four well known sources including the median of the ... sep um have fallen over that period between zero point three eight zero point seven percent\n\nA natural rate is now materially lower than we believe that would imply less upward pressure on inflation which is the flip side of the reasons revenge of the Philips curve a scenario and our policy of gradual interest rate normalization represents the phone seized attempt to take both of these risks seriously\nRemoving a combination too quickly could needlessly for shorten the expansion moving too slowly could risk rising inflation and inflation expectations so our path of gradually removing a combination while closely monitoring the economy is designed to balance these risks\nIn wrapping up this this discussion of the risks or I should emphasize that I've chosen to focus on three risks all of which have to do with the Philips curve there of course are myriad other risks and just to name a few a global growth economies abroad or the effect of ongoing trade disputes and financial stability issues among others\nSo I Hope my discussion of these uh particular risks give a sense of how we approach these issues\nMany of us have been looking back recently in the last weeks and months are on the decade that's passed since the depths of the financial crisis and in light of that experience\nI'm Glad to be lucky to be able to stand here and say that the economy is strong unemployment is near fifty year lows and inflation is roughly at our two percent objective\nAnd that the baseline outlook of many forecasters inside and outside the fast the fed is for more on the same\nThis historically rare pairing of steady low inflation and very low unemployment is a testament to the fact that we remain an extraordinary times\nAre ongoing policy of gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance the inevitable the inevitable risks that come with extraordinary times so it was to extend the current expansion while maintaining maximum employment and low and stable inflation thanks very much\nWhile maintaining maximum employment\nAnd low and stable inflation thanks very much and I'll look for your question [noise]\nI'm not so good cheer Jay ... speaking as\nNeighbor conference in most and\nWe are waiting for him now to take questions from the audience Lisa ... director of research at the global of global essay allocation of investments is moderating this part of the panel\nWrapped around all of you with questions but ah I'm actually not quaint asked Constance question right now I'm going to ask a question that I've been interested in in pursuing a with a with chair Powell and and again thank you so much for coming ... really appreciate your [noise]\nYour joining us today um and as you mentioned a it's a ten years since the the failure of women and um the Federal Reserve has um\nAnd the global central banks of the world has introduced many many new tools for dealing with the environment that they've experienced over the last decade and\nUm we heard from you today about a lot of normalization I'm an unemployment rate that was almost unsinkable a few years ago I'm a very benign inflation environment and I'm interested in what tools do you think that the fed is\nOur is said going to continue to use the tools that they've developed over the last decade or do you think that we go back to an old\nWe're we're we're going to stick to our a A R R balance sheet reduction program\nBecause it's working very well and I wouldn't want to send any signal that uh you know that we'll revisit that anytime soon\nGreat great [noise] um\n[noise] one of the uh the ongoing discussions within um\nThe the markets is what form of a labor price inflation is a central focus for the Federal Reserve and so when we think of that Jay Powell dashboard on inflation what are the some of the thing in terms of labor inflation what are some of the key indicators that you're interested\nIn watching key indicators of of labor inflation so you know we have the the big for our um UCI average hourly earnings Atlanta waged tracker and compensation per hour but we also look at you know we look at a a bunch of other things and\nHave you take those four by the way and you look at where they were five years ago there were there were closer to ... percent if you look at them now they're clustered around three percent so very gradually and an uneven way they've there is an increase great wonderful\nWonderful [noise] um [noise] uh\nMaybe I'll ask about um the use of negative interest rates the experience of for example the bank of Japan and the European Central bank um is there any lessons to be learned from their experience [noise]\nUm when you talk to you know we we didn't\nDeploy right on I think really seriously considered using negative rates in the United states didn't feel like uh if we just did it and uh\nYou know I think we can watch and see how that experience has worked for the other central banks did it's not something that we're you know currently examining but it I mean in theory it's a it's a tool I think we have the benefit of being able to watch\nOther central banks as they try to come out of negative race we I think\nI'm again we can benefit from their experience and and ah you know talk about that a down the road great great [noise] um [noise]\nSo it would be gradual normalization policy that we've we've seen um taken over the last ah year year and a half\nUm\nPerhaps one of the downsides may be that this very gradual normalization is creating a very benign volatility environment and perhaps creating um asset price or a bubble do you think that that could be a risk that we're taking with with a gradual policy\nIt's so it's a really interesting question and there\nI think they're sort of three separate things going on one there's our policy\nTo there's this secular declined interest rates that was happening any way that is it's been going on for thirty five years really\nAnd three is that we're getting into\nYou know a long long expansion and I think all of those things you use what you see as an expansion like that goes on as you you sometimes see you say low volatility using credit spreads coming into the risk spreads coming in and that kind of thing so what causes it could be it could be any of those three things that can be all of those three things\nUm there was a as you may have seen that was a big exchange on Twitter last weekend of among a bunch of economists about about this very question he probably also I\nJohn where last weekend of among a bunch of economists about about this very question probably also I um [noise] but I read that was with real interest\nAnd I still I I think but I I think what the dire predictions that low rates and Q. E. would produce either high inflation or um you know financial wants to build isn't come true didn't happen and I was I was one who was worried about that I was very worried about\n'em really more more of a a financial stability issues at high asset prices and I leverage you don't see it a banks are taking less risk getting her better capitalized households are not taking risks are borrowing or saving rate is high um it's just it hasn't turned up do you do see higher prices\nBy historical standards but you don't see I think a really bad case of financial stability that many had been concerned about from a conventional monitor falls for low for law so\nOne of the comments that I see here has been that um the conference here today or over the last couple of days has been actually very uh\nFocused on the U.S economy I'm very good information coming through from the U.S economy low unemployment um benign inflation strong grow et cetera um\nIt when we look globally however we ... we see some some some wrinkles in that story particular emerging markets et cetera you think that that is something that um we should start paying more attention to [noise]\nI don't know how much attention to it now but it's it's very important to pay attention to it or you know we we of course a devote a lot of resources I'm thinking to that and that's one of the principal risks that we face is a\nIs that uh\nAs you look around the world I think you still see a reasonably positive picture you see maybe slightly less positive at the beginning of this year you see a bit of a slow down in the um advanced economies and you see\nA really just a handful of emerging market countries experiencing significant turmoil and then I Would say some level of pressure\nBroadly but not a not a broad a a situation where there's a lot of instability and lots of pressure emerging markets so I think growth is still healthy but maybe under a little bit of pressure\nGreat [noise] um and I'll I'll finish with a sort of I guess a classic question that he probably here I'm pretty regularly physically\nBut I'll ask you about it and how about you know [laughter] um well\nActually one of the things that that you are you are touted as as you have had the shortest clothes fit needing to NA of any fed chair since they started so congratulations on a [laughter]\nYou know less is always more in in my book [noise] um but one of the questions is actually are you interested in moving to a chi when a after every meeting going forward [noise]\nSo we are we we're going to do a press conference after every meeting in a beginning with the January phone she made it so we did make that decision and uh that's something I\nI'm I'm really looking forward to I think it's a good chance to get out and talk about what the committee decided and this this will be so every ... not just the ... and not just the sep minutes but all of the meetings there'll be a press conference seems like a good\nImprovement in transparency and and uh just in communication channels so happy to do it\nGreat [noise] um so I Will finish this up and say thank you very much for spending some time with us really appreciate it um and from the entire memberships his name um thank you for being here today [noise]\nA church or a home with the national association of business economics conference\nIn Boston for ...

that is a Bloomberg Business flash\nAnd thank you so much Charlie palate you are listening to Bloomberg Businessweek I'm Jason Kelly alongside master Carol Monday felt like a big day today feels pretty busy as well but a little bit more on\nThe corporate side although as a as we mentioned as we are coming out of the last show certainly Jay Powell\nA lot of people paying attention to that but I'm really captivated by this Amazon story and what it will mean as we've sort of flows through the rest are ... are always talking about jobs where I can always talking about Jeff they were only about Amazon so when this company moves it's one that we really pay attention\nAnd I also think it's interesting in a time where these big technology companies are\nAre on everybody's radar particularly regulators around the world that you do have to wonder you know what has gone through the thinking of jak basis in effect separate Amazon whether they just think it's just the right thing to do 'em or is it to maybe take some of the heat off\nWell and not just regular politicians cannot Bernie Sanders had bases and Amazon squarely in his eyes he has had a them squarely in his sights and clearly jobs or something that this administration uh talked to a lot about it as well\nRight and let's not forget that Amazon has been hit by a bunch of lawsuits over the last few years alleging that has huge contract employees just got my licence and cut costs in the United states and abroad abroad and in fact see just saying hey come on let's play fairly\nAnother story that I'm really interested in much deeper into the show is this long feature in Bloomberg Markets about a Chuck Schwab Charles robbing and later on when it's really worth or read and you know I was thinking as I was reading in on it how much Chuck Schwab really fundamentally changed the stock market\nWell how wild is it that we're in is passive investing environment low cost investment environment that is what everybody wants to put pressure on the head start to put pressure on the whole investment universe and go back how many decades and that's a ... for\nDecades he's been doing these these eighty one years old uh still making a lot of noise out west a so let's talk about the markets a little bit because I got a couple of guys who sings and things in the markets here with us\nAround her detonating off it was for me just as he knows he's seen some things and Dave Wilson uh stocks editor for Bloomberg uh on my right as well between Carol and myself so Vince jump on in here you remember when Chuck show ... was you know in short fan yeah I Do\nNot exactly for decades but within spitting distance of it for me yes I'm actually remember when he first started this approach and\nYou know is back in the day and they speak about this much better than I Will wear you know the traditional brokerage house and you have thought where's this guy going with that oh no no no research really behind it no story to tell behind it you know people are individual stock pickers how are they going to manage this and lo and behold managed to manage\nAnd to that exact point David I mean one of the things that this story brings up is that when all this deregulation was happening they thought the people were going to take the way up and ... the other way I mean I have to think this is something that's fundamentally changed the way we think about buying and selling stocks\nFederal absolutely I mean you go back to the mid seventies and may down as they call that one fix commissions became let's take another path\nAnd ever since then we've seen costs caught after cause cut after costs got as swab or certainly but at the forefront of that so\nA lot of the savings that investors have enjoyed over the decades you can point right to Schwab is the source of those not just within that company but also through the industry's competitive response to what he was doing three\nPoint six trillion dollars worth of clients money so that's how he say are right and and obviously they approach appeal to a lot of facts ran and talk more about how I'm Jason that that there he's dealing with kind of ... tech startups and how they're on fighting it let's get into I'm also a\nChief Powell anything of note\nI think the the most the one thing that I took away from that um that speech that everything else pretty much the F ... is it is yeah he really is but I mean he's [noise] he he drills right through all the BS I mean it gets right to the bottom line which I Love\nYou don't have to read through anything he says it's they're out in the open and he basically said as long as inflation expectations remained anchored\nWe will proceed as we said however if that should change and inflation expectations should pick up we will react period and independent again data dependent but there's a point of actually really believing in I mean you know no disrespect to prior fetch chairs\nBut they would say why would they independent and then when the data would say they wanted to do left go left they would still go right so\nI think I think Jay Powell is very much to his word and he will do is actually as he says\nHey we can also had the Dow Jones industrial average at a record right\nYes we do and then it's a function of some of those bigger companies doing just fine uh intel notably mean are you you had a report out of this from blue fin research Martin ers\nAnd they were talking about a couple of things one is that if you look at the next generation of ... chip technology intel may be able to introduce products using it\nA bit sooner than ... beyond that they're talking about how revenue for the fourth quarter and for next year's first quarter may beat analysts estimate\nBased on what they're seeing in terms of second half project production\nYou put that altogether you got into a more than four percent you've got other chip stocks doing well then of course into and the Dow industrial who sort of her and helping things along today even General Electric bit of a rebound there you know ... ... a former Dallas that we should point out if it's notable\nIsn't it a good day care when we could talk about chip stocks just makes me happy it's just such a great start\nTo you know the number one gainer and the number one to climate and pay five hundred about chip stock I mean again are empty being the decline are\nWell that's because as as intel gives AMD negative way or by one of the last great rivalries out those like coke and Pepsi and the chip world\nExactly what are you reading on the Bloomberg today that kind of caught your attention and it's\nAll about a ... Italy Italy Italy or you know to Mayo came out and made some comments today towards the middle of the U.S market basically saying\nYou know these on elected officials in the you pretty much on your own business but not tells the ties and try to run their government and I think we're we're seeing is ah we saw with the Taliban ten year ...\nThe spread between German tenure bonds and the tiny town your bones went out at three hundred and three basic points it's really widening 'em it's costing a great deal more to swap Italian bonds into US dollars funding for Italian banks as we\nTo swap Italian bonds into US dollars\nFunding for Italian banks as we get to the urine to that pressure still yet to bear they're not even stepped up to that see and when you said Italy I thought it was going to be the Ferrari started picking at five hundred a loyal customers to get the chance to buy it's almost two million dollar Mondesir because that's where I thought you were\nIn every one of them and spoken for by the way like I wasn't\nOne of those ... had her line agave Wilson has why so that one not one of those there yeah [laughter]\nWell so that or you'll be back with us shortly for suck in charge of the day and ... get back to doing what you do All right and in the meantime let's get some world and national headlines of it that we turn to Bob mood here in the Bloomberg eleven three of his from have I think you and the defense\nMoving product there were a lot in common carriers in response to that you'll see us and we have already taken pricing up in the ... and the fourth quarter beginning in September a which should improve the profit outlook for that business going forward as a remarkably good quarter a I Would say that the the overlaps in the fourth quarter did a little bit tougher\nBut we do to increase our revenue guy just today because we are feeling confidence that\nIn fact we're we're getting the north American beverage business back on track and it's a big piece of the overall revenue the balance of the company the revenue growth is strong enough to continue to be strong quarter after quarter whether it's international at nine percent a freeway is the most consistent consumer products company out there and continues to perform revenue at a very strong level\nSo we we do feel good about sustaining the north American beverage sugar oh\nAll right that was ... Johnson earlier on Bloomberg TV\nAnd ... as Carroll said with us in the studio you're listening to an interview you covered the earnings you follow this company and the whole industry closely Craig shares are down what did investors here or not hear that they want it to\nThat was an interesting morning you know as a sort of a classic mixed report I mean they beat on profit beat on revenue the north American beverage unit which is the key thing return to growth but\nFirst of all joined the call and free market trading the shares fell clearly when the CFO was asked by an analyst if they had plans to look at to get into candidates and he said no\nHe basically said the U.S federal ban makes it very difficult in that we do not have any plans at this point to do that and the shares took a debt right you know off of that news which says something pretty interesting about where we are and where investors are with this whole space beverages on the place that you're seeing the company's show up there's a lot of thought that there's going to be a whole line of wellness beverages at UCD\nEven candidates THC could be an ingredient so very interesting to see ... investors react negatively to ... saying we don't have plans to do that well this is of course coming on the heels of Coca Cola saying exactly exactly right Coca Cola you know we broke the story not too long ago saying that coke was looking specifically at CBD the non psycho after active piece of the plant for wellness drink so\nInvestors clearly you know concerned that Pepsi what sort of rule it out\nWell and their shares are down a bit wild coax have been up right marginally I'm so we mentioned the the candidates essay on the beverage side who has the upper hand at this point\nIt coke coke has done better with the beverage is of course you have to remember with Pepsi that they have free to lay and Frito Lay is absolutely a powerhouse in that clip that we heard the CFL refers to it as the best packaged food company out there\nThat's not much of a stretch I don't know as we've seen center of the grocery store get decimated the campbells and catalogs and General Mills or the world so the chips have just been very very strong\nThey're always at the end of the aisle and I'm always thinking about that\nAnd I'll tell you it ain't bragging if it's true\nRight exactly and all this stuff you hear about the healthy consumers you know some of that is true the same time to read owes toasty does Russell's Cheetos these things just\nAre cash drivers year after year\nAnd ... and ... not last market share the way other big food companies out there that I don't get this is what we've always liked about pepsico that they're not just exposed to the average is a Coca Cola but now all of a sudden because they're not saying we are getting into Canada is that the problem\nYeah it's interesting um but there's been calls to split off there's always been that theory that with the old Nelson ... idea ill it's been brought back to a certain extent ... you know who this is her final day a CEO the company she stepped down officially tomorrow\nShe resisted that because\nThey're more than half the revenue and I was from food you know when you put a Quaker and Frito together and free does a powerhouse so that's the thing that kind of props up the company coke has been better on beverages but Pepsi now saying that Mountain Dew is back Pepsi's back\nBut they're spending a lot on advertising and that's hurting the profit in the north American beverage in its North American beverage in return to growth on his outside profit down fourteen percent that's tariffs on aluminum\nThat's more spending on marketing and higher transportation\nCosts and so how much of this is a how much is Pepsi Craig's sort of a bellwether of any sort in terms of consumer tastes and kind of what they're buying what they are not buying mean they have such a broad portfolio is just described\nThey do and I think the thing that you know we find interesting about it is that in on the one hand you see the aversion to sugar you see the consumer ... moving away from sugary soda towards other types of drinks whether it's coffee they talked about their Starbucks partnership being strong and a quarter\nTowards other types of drinks whether it's coffee they talked about their Starbucks partnership being strong and a quarter\nBut then on the other hand you see how fickle us consumer is because again salty\nSalty chips these are not healthy products I'm Sorry you know chips are just not a health food but people love them like I said and it's not um\nIf not organic non GMO toasty does it just regular cool ranch Doritos better doing well so it's a window into I think how difficult the consumer is and it's part of the big reason why the big wouldn't beverage couples have had so much trouble the last five or ten years what still\nThe most important markets in the north American markets is it overseas they're\nVery strong internationally they did well over there I mean I still seems like a trade off North America that's where I think as far as a bellwether for that company is the north American beverage instilled the key thing part of that is because people just take for granted how good Frito is but it does feel like North America still the key players that's with a new CEO is going to have so I got to say\nTo read those have lots of love\nFor it anyway Craig GE alone a bigger gains consumer reporter covering all the cars were soda cannabis whatever you think so much for

you know ... search ... character assassination you know character blood thinning machine\nYou got to watch judge Kavanaugh last week you know the witnesses the professor Ford mentioned don't corroborate her story you know that the New York times said that Mrs Ramirez was calling others not sure if it was Brett Kavanaugh and was asking them if they remembered and then you saw\nWhat

about it because it's Russia Russia Russia stormy store\nNobody in the media talks about it because it's Russia Russia Russia stormy stormy stormy calling me calling me calling me you know Michael cone and [noise] and Paul Manafort it's Robert Mueller Andrew Weissmann\nIs what the country's been talking about thirty five days you get to change all of this\nEvery bit of it\nNow we have the senator from Hawaii was meant to shut up now she wants the FBI to investigate and ice throwing incident at a college bar you gotta be kidding me\nWhen he was in you know a young guy and yell and that apparently there was the former classmate said he threw ice at a party and somebody ice\nLet me tell you what's going to happen this week Mitch McConnell and the Senate leadership most of which I don't have a lot of respect for but\nThey have been good on this I think they've handled properly but the seriousness deserves and also the resolve that an injustice has also occurred here we'll see what senator snowflake who's running for president yesterday in Massachusetts has to do and say about it McConnell\nSaying earlier today that he wants to vote this week in the Senate and for that to happen Jamie do pre reminds us the majority leader must file cloture by Wednesday that's tomorrow will be here tomorrow in the nation's capital in order to force a final vote by Saturday otherwise\nWe vote wouldn't officially be this week I'm so for example if the cloture vote\nIs if you file cloture on Wednesday the final votes on Saturday if you filed on Thursday it's on Sunday violet on friday the vote would be next Monday if you file cloture on Saturday It's Tuesday depending on when the FBI report comes in\nSo that's going to be wide open and whether or not\nThe three Republican senators go along with endless investigations is ultimately I guess going to be up to them Lindsey Graham who's going to join us later was on Hannity last night and I thought I had a pretty good idea I said you know what we can turn this whole election and thirty five days into a referendum on Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat would happen if something really where did occur and where one vote short here's what I Would tell the press would appeal the verdict in the Senate to the ballot box [noise]\nThis good man should not be destroyed [noise] saw a legitimize this process by one vote short fall onto the next person\nHate to be the next person nominated I Would feel horrible that we destroyed cabin out so what would I Do\nI Would nominate him and that would take this case to the American painful and I'd ask voters in Indiana and Missouri and North Dakota and other places for ... saying who nominated to get the president and see if they are loners won't to appeal the verdict of their senator\nSo if you were saying you for a one vote short here saying how would appeal the case of the American people\nOkay\nI you know what at this point and thirty five days let me tell you what's at stake\nEverything that I've been telling you about why vitamin saying this for six months or longer now this is the most important mid term election in our lifetime if you like the progress that I just described to you then it's going to happen\nBy the way Donald Trump this just went up on and read on the Drudge Report\nTrump gain millions from questionable tax strategies according to the New York times I guess they're getting off I guess maybe they think they're losing the vote on judge Kavanaugh so President Trump participated in question about tax strategy is in the Nineteen nineties\nAnd allowed him to accrue millions of dollars in additional wealth from his father's real estate empire according to the New York times newspaper reported that Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation to help this guy's otherwise taxable income that came from gifts from their parents\nOkay the IRS has been investigating him I guess for most of his adult life\nAnd also I ... a big shock there\nBut this is what's at stake you want you want to go back 'cause this is the endless investigation and do you want to reward the party of slander and blood joining 'cause that's the Democratic party you know thinking this five weeks from tonight\nYou're going to tune in to the news midterms big election night big coverage all the networks\nYou have the opportunity to shock the world again\nIf you remember they never thought Donald Trump could when they never believed that can happen\nNow imagine you there are two things that are going to happen\nOn election night five weeks from now\nOne is you're going to turn on your TV set and you're going to see a bunch of guinea liberals happy to announce that Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house and maybe even Senator Chuck Schumer the liberal from New York is going to be the Senate majority leader\nOr you can tune in and watch the results come in and they have to announce that the U.S house of representatives remains in control of the Republicans and that the Republicans have picked up\nTwo three four five seats in the United States Senate which would render by the way Collins Murkowski and snowflake irrelevant\nAnd that even if they stopped Brett Kavanaugh he could be re nominated and next time he would get a vote up or down and he would become a Supreme Court justice in spite of the slander and the smears and everything else\nAnd all of those anchors that had been for two years trying to destroy the president as an extension of all things Democrat\nYou could see them spiral into the state of shock and denial and depression again\nThat's not going to stop and that there's going to ratchet up the next day Donald Trump should be arrested for tax fraud Donald Trump Stormy Daniels ... Russia wants to go back to Russia let's investigate someone else's taxes from Thirty years ago where their loan applications from Thirty years ago\nYou have the power and the ability to do all of that\nFive weeks from tonight\nYou get to decide what kind of TV you get to watch want to see the media crumble want to see them sad want to see a meteor freak out want to see CNN anchors you know talking about white lashes again and all the other insane commentary that happen\nLet me tell you the races the states you all know what district you living because this was a smart audience we have a map up on Hannity dot com that we're we've been putting up well updated this week\nWe're going to put up to Seventy big races where to let you look at them and if it happens to be your congressional district you might want to plan on voting five weeks from today if you live in Florida Rick Scott\nFive weeks from today if you live in Florida Rick Scott has been a great governor and he's not responsible for the red tide\nUm and of course Rhonda scientists would make a great governor there if you live in Indiana Joe Donnelly you know what we can do better than Joe Donnelly supporting Chuck Schumer\nIf you live in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp we can do better than Heidi Heitkamp supporting everything Schumer if you live in West Virginia you can do better than Joe mansion\nMostly supporting everything Schumer if you live in Missouri You can do better than Claire McCaskill\nSupporting pretty much everything Schumer\nAnd I know I'm ... and you know Martha ... Sally out in she's a total rock star in Arizona served her country\nAgainst her opponent was out there protesting you know part of the resistance and the same thing Dean Heller in Nevada another important race\nYou know all these races matter it's in your hands if you want the success but this this is what you'll get what the Democrats the party is Mirren slander will be rewarded\nThey will take their crumbs back they will have endless nonstop never ending Trump investigations they will try to impeach him they will\nNo trial lemonade ice and have open borders they will keep their Obamacare that's their agenda\nIt just ... show is a nice little sixty eight sunny wins the ADA or the\n\nTalk sports Ninety seven one F.

times best seller the Russia hopes and David ... new book is out today probably the premier writer on\nOn Christianity which by the way you kind of bridges the gap between real intellectual biblical study and people like me the common man that does not have the knowledge that he has\nAnd it's called Jesus is risen pole and the early church and we ended up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and their bookstores everywhere a one quick thing I mean you do have that amazing talent but as\nI look at myself as a guy not spent my life studying the Bible um I read it now more than I ever have and you you have made this a part of your life study\nYes I just when I I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and I\nKnow your incorrigible jerk like me [laughter] yeah like Brett Kavanaugh and\nYeah and I know like a like rock Obama's was part of the two gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and drinking in excess yeah\nThere you go in and so I just I was always a seeker and I kept looking for answers and and and finally I found the answers that that I thought were intellectual obstacles and I don't really think they were ultimately but there are intellectual answers and reasonable answers and we can give\nAnswers to why we believe and were encouraged by uh the Bible\nPeter fact tells us to always be prepared to give the reader that you believe and there are rational reasons to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's consistent with raising so I wanted to share with the game because I'll make this quick quick I I got on fire for the Bible in theology so I've been reading it\nPretty heavy on and off for Twenty years and I have a passion to share what I've learned and help people accelerate are learning curve reduce their\nUh intimidation about scripture so there'll be inspired to read it so these look these Christian themed books I writer encouraged are designed to encourage people to get in the Bible themselves\nWell it's worked for me although I have a long way to go obviously anybody that knows me knows that and by the way sodas Greg Jared I'm just saying Greg\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nWas mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself civil is Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace three Julie sweat mixed or\nBut on the original story the Christine toward a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing they told you ... committee which they have no memory at all\nTo support this now I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections a you're not remember a Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal of this party entry and the Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm listening who is that the party\nAnd it didn't match up with um with Christine forks account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm burning and squeeze\nA who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about a Christine ports uh allegations so uh I listen I\nI I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence\nTo support this did find out actual real evidence to support it than I change my mind\nBut I don't think it's there well\nIf you go through I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell I'm now she's the independent push prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes\nAnd she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her\nBut she pointed out and he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove itself and then she goes on this cases even weaker than that\nAnd then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually\nThe failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant are inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party\nUm and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there is no corroboration there are a big holes in the stories\nAnd at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that ... Katz says her friend sending out emails and she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly insisted on the issue of of sexual misconduct\nAnd they're sending out letters to the deer so and so do you know anything please call us at all no those letters went out\nI Know please some core operation you know the ... case\nRight in the time they said they call they talked to thousands of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot of people can look at it and on on the Rachel metro thing you know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nIt listed a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of Ford about her therapist and the therapist notes and the white we even know about this because remember Ford says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two\nShe did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty\nThirty six years to two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage there with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name\nAnd she checks therapists notes and therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that after session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name that you're the only evidence\nThat it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer a confidential ... even even her account of how she finally\nMentioned it to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college and I know this is what it's\nCalled the ... that's what they say\nWell now we have the Democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said demand to just shut up and sit down on Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants an investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about his drinking he said he lives here he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college in high school kids I drank too much beer\nBut they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so that it will become a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care\nAbout anything except destroying him so here's objects question\nRight go ahead we don't want to get out of the things that he claims from an emphasis on the facts misconduct allegations to wants to be truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that\nThere really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're\nTalking about whether he told the truth about drinking ... mentioned many times\nIn his testimony that he did um in fact drink today rocks harbors an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking\nCricketer mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr as I got to let it go there thank you so much Byron York widows actors
