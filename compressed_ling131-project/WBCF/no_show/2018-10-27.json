is not\nThe benefit of tax cuts so if you've got ... you can do this and two minutes later on at your own convenience since you got to start go fill up ten forty put\n'em got married filing jointly with three kids put and fifty thousand for adjusted gross income do the math exemptions deductions you can't get a tax cut because you have no federal tax liability\nAnd this was the thing I get into a mainstream on Wall and social networks and everything I mean I get into big fights the Turks some Facebook everywhere or I call them you know the people that are getting a tax cut ... get a tax cut because they weren't paying literally correct\n... although I mean it but if you look at it for the Democrat way if you didn't give a tax cuts you could have given them more on income credits or some crap where they could have given them money back even though they never paid anything in I mean you're right it was real and what what what I said was\nAnybody who's paying income taxes got a tax cut those people who didn't wait one that you're talking about wind paying them so much they've been dusting world\nOh of course yes I'm saying that's the ... the misnomer you know the that's what the liberal media is putting out though they're saying oh the poor people are just getting taken advantage of that if we're talking about him do pay tax right\nRight so he goes oh so it's a it's a it's a species arguing and they know that I've got a quick story by about ... and I I called him ... I guess it's drink or something I don't know\nBut I was at CNN about ten years ago eleven years ago and they were trying to see if we can get an a left right show going and they had me going up against the air with Michael die shouldn't be up against Roland Martin me up against Rachel Maddow was one of the people and\nThen it was me and this this single guy and first of all he's about a foot shorter than I was which I found to be audited bad I'm standing on a box\nAnd and and as soon as they still they sort of said art and here we go you know I read whatever's on the teleprompter and then we're supposed to argue or debate about the topic\nAnd this is again you know and and and I'm tired of this stuff and this was a bunch of garbage what do you think of it that he went [laughter] yelled at me the whole time it was the weirdest thing and I looked at the guy who said what are you doing\nBecause I knew that we were actually trying to get a job you know which would have been sort of a cool back and forth to cause they got rid of cross fire a long time ago there were considering bringing something like that back\nAnd and I and I looked at them I just look right out to be said to stop yelling at me just don't make any sense and I think it was actually about Obama and the birth certificate and he said that no Republican has ever been questioned about his citizenship or his right to run and I said Oh yes John McCain was\nThey said that he was born in Panama so he can run for president him or he just flipped out his eyeballs got bigger started screaming so when you say the young Turks I think to myself I don't know why they have any followers at all because of the guy you sort of the screaming artist that silly is\nRight and and that's the thing of and that's why you got so many people that are following the Democrat still to this day um the people are arguing they won't even go the IRS dot Gov to see that they're being life\nAnd I hope to battle Wilder and

he was evidently a after she was on Fox News it says in this article that she uh was contacted by that guy that\nTurned out the bombs he uses mental mind but what she did was he made threats towards her\nAnd she reported it to Twitter he didn't like on a couple of heart count and posted her a ... threat so she reported it to Twitter and a\nShow where he had gotten her picked her and then spent all this stuff to her and a Twitter she complained to them that he thought he was fine with it and\nDo nothing about it\nYeah they didn't rise to the level of uh like he was ... abuse their views and uh evidently there were some outcry over it but uh anyway I Would look over at that if I were you\nWere very I think I think the Jerry earlier ... there were some ...\nAnd yeah we've been hearing person that is yes I Believe she sang at the same for\nThe yeah he tweeted just a yesterday he said\nOh wait a minute she said hey quarter the guy that you are a reporter and guess what he's saying

the rest of them\nKnow it was six forty five that she posted that to\nThe show it was so ... so was this morning\nOr worse than I Know it's not\nOkay or don't you yeah I thought you said yesterday okay Well Jerry I hear you and I appreciate Jim Carey was on his earlier so what would you be around these huge\nThank you appreciate the\nTop of that I mean really we give you around for that and

what's going on I\nWrite I Am this ah for ah for hot I just wanted to ask that I I just feel are going to vote straight conservative the ticket as much as you can in the state but as I told your screener earlier\nThere's not a single Republican a representative in the state of Massachusetts and the two senators are a quite a ... there are a\nDemocrat and I'm just I'm just concerned that a ... with one might pull it off I mean I don't know I mean I I I Know that you interviewed a Jeff deal but I I just I just wanted to get your what your feelings on on on first of all I'm afraid that\nThis uh situation with carrier Kavanaugh no people might forget it I don't forget it certainly and uh I think that uh it was an ...\nWhat are what are your questions about deal with these used to be a be bugged sounds dumb but it seems to be the real deal I mean why not vote for him and he he sounds like he's the right guy if you want conservative a conservative image seed to meet anybody to the right of of Elizabeth Warren would be better when\nWe were well that that's what I Want to do but I'm just wondering what what you're a ... or so far\nAs a whole as to how the election might come out this is a gas for I mean you you you talked to a lot of people I just wanted to get some idea that people are concerned well of the house is going to go to the uh if the house goes the wrong way\nI was just going to go to the uh if the house go the wrong way than was honored guest she uh uh people trying to carry on this investigation which has gone on for two years of the president right indefinitely and I just want to get your feeling on it as a as a host in a completely different part of the country\nWhat well I'll tell you what I've been saying and I and I really do think this is going to be two to four seats in a ... increase on the uh in the Senate I think the Republicans or conservatives will gain seats in the Senate\nUm I think that on the house it's a toss up I don't know what's going to happen in the house I Hope that the the energy that the writer got out of what happened with Kavanaugh will continue I Hope that the tax cuts that will continue I Hope that jobs coming back that's going to continue it really looked at the bottom line is this going to come out to turn out\nThe left is going to turn out they always do the right needs to turn out to make sure that we keep things going on with the going I think that lives with Warren is in trouble no she gonna lose out a low but when it comes to the actual numbers house and Senate I think senators pretty firmly going to stay Republican I think that the houses to still it's also and could certainly go left if you will to ... don't go and vote\nRight and that that and that's the point I mean you've got a someone like a I Believe that someone or all the same general philosophy as a Ocasio Cortez in New York that is taking a seat for my uh I think it's the ... district whatever Oh thank you very much\nI appreciate you thank you I got a lot of people who are saying that the Elizabeth Warren is up by a lot\nAnd I'm good I'm looking at the polling you're I I Hope that Jeff deals still has a chance\nAnd perhaps we'll have I'm a tutor on soon to talk about this ... is the guy who are turned to when it comes to what's happening in Boston in Massachusetts and even actually usually good great brain on him and he does he was a great show on under your kale Monday through friday noon or so we'll find out I mean he certainly will he thought it was promising\nAt last we spoke but I'm at this point I mean I'm looking at the spread and she's up by twenty five points to thirty six points in some of these polls\nNot sure how good these polls are uh the latest one is a plus twenty five but this is from UMass Lowell\nSo I'm not really sure what if anything can change their but still to me it looks like at least two seats will be gained in the Senate by the Republicans if not three or four it's

weeks the arrest in Florida\nThe caravan in Mexico the Supreme Court associate justice hearing before Congress the very sharp words by the partisan leadership in Congress and in the White House and in the media\nThe red and the blue the global lists and the nationalist the urban and rural\nMichael has guided this conversation towards\nMoments in American history that resemble and alienation and our radicalization of the population we can speak up the revolutionary war but today because there was a new book\nFrom the distinguished professor at Columbia University in American studies Andrew Delbanco\nWe turn to the period of ten to Fifteen Years Twenty years before the civil war of Eighteen sixty this is coming running up to this to the fugitive slave act and then after the fugitive slave act they gave the power to the southern slave owners to\nPush gangs posses into the free states and drug goon ups gone kidnap a duck brutalized slaves who run away Michael a very good evening to

alienation of the population from itself a radicalization so that those who disagree are being forced to choose sides\nAre in Andrew Darrell bunkers new book the war before the war\nHe presented the story of fugitive slaves and the struggle for America's soul from the revolution to the civil war this is a a historical analogy if it works and Michael is identified that the abolitionist the Eighteen fifties look very much like the strong minded\nA social justice warriors of the eight of the early twenty first century and according to the analogy here both sides are forcing those in between to choose so that they're destroying the middle there discouraging the middle\nWhat is lost when that happens well dunk or things of that and I want to read a passage that he's sites in his introduction this is from Richard Haass daughter the historian\nHe wrote this up in Nineteen sixty eight during the year fifty years ago when the U.S was pulling itself apart\nOver the Vietnam War over civil rights over violence in Europe over the Cold War pulling itself apart and ... wrote about the loss of comedy that is a concern for Dell bunk oh that was a concern in the Eighteen fifties and Michael and I talk about it because that means there is no center\nWhen it comes down to according to offset or is this comedy exist in a society that to the degree that those enlisted in its contending interests have a basic minimal regard for each other one part of your interests seeks the defeat of an opposing interest on matters of policy but\nAt the same time seeks to avoid crushing the opposition denying the legitimacy of its existence or its values or inflicting upon an extreme and gratuitous humiliation beyond the substance of the gains that are being sought\nThe basic humanity of the opposition is not forgotten civility is not abandon\nThe sense that a community life must be carried on after the issues of the moment I've been fought over and one is seldom very far out of mind an awareness that the opposition will someday be the government is always present repeat an awareness of the opposition will someday be the government is always present\nThe reality in value of comedy can be best appreciate it when we contemplated society in which is almost completely lacking Michael that's a warning\nHops that eroded in Nineteen sixty eight we know that at some point the alienation that we experience today started there in the Vietnam War we know that we lived through it we were young men then\nIt's wonderful and important that those sentiments should come from Richard upstairs because Richard hopes that it was writing a in the Nineteen sixties and\nIt was Richard hopes that it was writing a in the Nineteen sixties in\nIn ... before or Vietnam or the fifties and sixties in the last period of the after glow of World War two that created\nUp the longest lasting up period not simply of comedy comedy but of a sense of national kinship and unity bet that then began to the phrase slowly with Vietnam and has unraveled to the point where it is today much like the period before the civil war but\nHopes Tatar was writing from a period where both both of elites in America you know right and left to that extent we're we're committed to the same larger vision and up to each other\nOr there's no getting around it and today the opposite is true and what's really important I'm an ... co I'm In in in all of his writing about ... abolitionist and the civil war up\nUnderscores the fact that the abolition is considered terrorism\nTo being necessary if only to break the never ending gradually lose some of goods and met a quote in his book on the\n... because they meant I didn't enjoy the opposition not on the basis of policy but physically destroy so that the opposition would never be the government that's what they meant to do\nExactly and it is it because as I'm as radical a profit seeking to expunged what is if all\nThe spending of evil is the destruction of fat author or elite party which is no longer fraternal but now the devil incarnate and what this does which is exactly what happened in the Eighteen fifties is\nThat this I'm a clear and uh you know ... varnish declaration that we are out to to to reform you and make you submit and if you refuse it will be expunged\nIs exactly what drove south to the intense

front deductions um that that offset any income that might be coming in business owners themselves have the availability to take some significant deductions on capital equipment\nThat they buy from many case of a million dollars a year John and if you're a business owner and you want to buy equipment like Jared 'cause you don't necessarily have to pay for it you can put a down payment you can finance the rest as long as you put that equipment or that property in the service\nYou can take a big tax deduction for Cushing who did this\nTo the extent where there's deductions were even exceeded as income and then he was able to carry forward those losses or even carry them back as well so everything you did was completely legal and above board and not only that it's good tax strategy\nA business owners themselves should be paying attention to that kind of tax strategy making investments like that\nIn capital equipment property taken the tax deduction I think it's a very very good you know strong business move and I hope that a lot of accountants are making those recommendations to their clients did\nThe tax cuts and jobs active twenty Seventeen make this even more attractive as because this is the first year we discovered that it did so these these\nDeductions have been in place for a while I mean the big one that a lot of business owners needs to be aware of its costs that section one Seventy nine deduction just ask your account and about that that deduction year after year I'm is kind of up for whether or not it was going to be renewed ball and the taxi format\nNot only was it made permanent but it was increased from like five hundred thousand dollars up to a million dollars that businesses can take as a as an accelerated depreciation to touch and not only that in the tax reform act the act at allowed an added more options for certain business used vehicles\nTrucks in your business as well that didn't exist before\nSo these are all things that are there and you and I are talking about this now it's late October there is still time left in the year business owners that you can you can make investments in capital of the equipment you can get them

with Canada as you mentioned in Mexico looks to be moving toward resolution the dispute with Europe has not\nAs not at this point crashed anybody's economy and Europe is talking but this dispute with China as I indicated is going to drag on does this worries small businesses because they're worried about the macro economy or can they see this in their prices\nWell there is that there there are a lot of impacts on small businesses most small businesses themselves um or not to ... affected by the trade war but their indirectly affected by the trade war and there are a large companies like Ford\nWho mouths the approximately twenty thousand employees that are going to be laid off\nBecause of increasing costs and Harley Davidson that's moving operations to ah you know other countries outside of the U.S to avoid ah the terrorists that they would have to pay and companies like three am and caterpillar that are facing increased costs on on some of the corn materials that they buy\n'em and also some of the markets that they might be losing because of the war that's going on right now and it is a war with China\nThat is an indirect impact on on small small contractors suppliers vendors that that work up to those larger companies\nAnd then of course there's the consumer effect there is you know the most recent round of tariffs\nDo affect electronics and consumer goods that are being sold by the Wal Marts and the targets of the world and\nThat you know filters down to consumers who for many you know our our customers of small businesses and if they're paying more there are willing to take away some disposable income that they could be spending this holiday season\nA at a small merchants are or restaurants so it does have that impacts right now like you said things are pretty much resolved with Canada and Mexico to be aware you know all the legislatures still have to approve this right\nSo that's still up in the air depending on how the midterms go\nEurope right now we're sort of at a truce so discussions continue on with China like you mentioned before the big thing I\nI was at a meeting of small a bunch of small manufacturers just this week in Minneapolis and some of them were saying that all of this you know you ... yelling and screaming between the Chinese and and the American counterparts\nIs all coming down to Trump and president gee I'm meeting in November and I am one guy stood up and said you know what I understand but Trump is doing when I have a big agreement that I'm going to make with a significant supplier I Want to meet that person face to face\nAnd work it out with him I don't need my sales guys are representatives doing on my part\nAnd some people think that that's what Trump strategy is that that's a lot of bravado and all building up to the big deal that ah that that the two of them are going to are going to make in in November um doesn't sound like you're as optimistic about that happening\nAll I Know I'm not however I uh\nI Do have a positive here to end this the macro consumers are spending gene spending and spending and spending the wall Street Journal notes that the consumer spending is powered by all the jobs and the really good jobs and that means a good Christmas season and that's what we care about right now\nAgreed agreed and you know I think that the president now at your realizes we've heard the GDP um you know as potentially impacted by a trade issues with China but John I mean right now GDP is growing and like you said consumers are spending and the economy is strong and\nUh you know maybe from the president's perspective is like if I'm if we're going to fix this issue with China\nAn issue that so many of my clients have been complaining about for years why not do it now

mid term plus a profile of the Silicon Valley veteran in charge of fixing the Democrats technology but first there were reports this week the U.S is refusing to restart trade negotiations with China until Xi Jinping's regime\nLike the concrete proposals to address complaints about us tech in the country\nNational economic council director Larry Kudlow discuss the issue like the White House on Tuesday we've\nHad so much trouble with China\nTheir response which they never made a technology transfers\nUh IT vast\nAlright so Bloomberg is deputy White House mind during Bloomberg Ninety nine when studios here in Washington DC and I I what I wanted to ask you about my was if this is just another negotiation tactic but before I get into that there's some information that needs to be triangulate and where are you in that process\nClearly administration is frustrated with China for not giving you know a concrete proposal on the a lot of these um complaints about intellectual property in particular\nOn the other hand China's very frustrated with the United states\nIn that they feel like they've tried to negotiate in the past\nOnly to have the U.S kind of pull away from things and then there has been a a a view and the Chinese leadership that it's not even worth it until after the midterms are over\nSo they're kind of waiting to see what the stance of the administration will be after the midterms and they're not treating what the administration is doing right now as quite as serious so that's kind of the the over arching place where we stand\nAs far as we know they're still planning to get together at the G ... meeting which will be at the end of November ah and have a a meeting between president Xi and President Trump\nAnd that'll be a moment where things can get restarted if both sides want to get restarted\nWell let's talk generally then about these kind of preconditions and demands from the U.S side from the Trump Administration how have those been going over with the Chinese\nOr the Chinese have are just um grown quite frustrated with the U.S and they haven't gone over very well but on the other hand\nChina has a long history of just getting into negotiations on these points and dragging them out so the administration also has reason to be a look at the record of China and these negotiations with a rather jaundiced view\nIt sounds like this move may not necessarily escalate\nThe issue but it certainly won't help calm the issue I'm curious if this is going to lead to have in this play down the expectations for the G twenty and what may come to that meeting it just seems like this is creating some bumps in the ...\nI personally think that it's better to wait until after the election to assess where they're going on this because the Chinese don't have have sort of reached a conclusion not to take but the Trump\nStarted as you say this is kind of drip drip drip and it's been going on while I think it's started off a because ah the president was kind of in ... and all these trade battles and and\nUh the fed was raising interest rates in at that as the as the interest rates went up more people were buying and investing buying dollars in investing in the U.S in the U.S treasury bonds\nAnd that was raising interest rates and raising the value that are raising more importantly raising the value of the dollar and that was under cutting Trump's attempt to a a level the playing field it's a dollar goes up us exports are more expensive\nA U.S imports are cheaper and and that's exactly the opposite of what the fed was doing so I think that was initially what the president you know was most concerned about\nBut as the stock market has gotten wobbly the concerns have seemingly a switch to that obviously the president has you know\nA chess dumped them you know constant times about the stock market being you know are at record levels et cetera et cetera\nOkay ... teach me something when you get a little psychological if you help me out here is the president does continue with this what appears to be a strategy I'm just sort of something that is that right but not necessarily having an impact on paper not necessarily could he still have a psychological impact\nOn the fat and how they perform behind closed doors [laughter] I mean I mean I'm\nSure I mean the ... former I'm I'm\nFed vice chairman Stan Lee Fisher who's been around a monetary policy making and just international policymaking circles for a long time including his head of the bank of Israel including as a senior position ... a\nSenior position at the international Monetary Fund said he has said that he doesn't think the you know\nThe Trump criticism will convince the fed to stop raising interest rates but he acknowledged no this steady drip drip drip of you know has to have you know a subtle influence in the back of people's minds on on you know they can't help but not be thinking about it now\nSome people like Larry Summers the former a I'm a treasury secretary is now a bird hard thinks that you know if anything to federal overcompensate\nYou know you tell me I Can't raise interest rates wow I'll show you ah so ah but it it it it it's hard to say that it's not going to have some\nYou know if somebody's stumping you every single day and if that person is the president it's hard to say that that you you you know that that's not affecting you in some way\nWell Jay Powell can look to another former fed chair who got political pressure a little bit of it Paul Volcker for who's out with a new book tell us about the book\nIs focused out next week and uh it's written a with a co written with my my colleague Christine hopper and it goes you know he's had a long and storied career or at the treasury at the fed a as a sort of\nWhere he maintained his independence pressures right as he raised rates to try and you know stop inflation right if the president if President Trump thinks is obese or high rates should go back and\nLook at what a what a chairman Volcker tolerated even if interest rates got over twenty\nPercent back then and he had a lot of flak for that call it a lot of flak\nFor that and uh you know he recounts a you know several episodes in the book there was one one time when there are a number of uh of Reagan appointees I'm a\n... stage a palace coup against uh against the Volcker and a force them to cut interest rates he he he went to a\nA a James Baker who was in the White House chief of staff and said ah ah look I'm resigning uh uh uh so that then the those those uh uh appointees backed off\nA they talked about another episode where he was called into the oval office ah and Reagan was sitting there looking kind of uncomfortable and Baker told them well the president was ordering you

actually pull it off for them\nI understand that when the president does say things like talking about body signing a reporter he's talking about it at a rally and inspiring up his base you know he got a lot of cheers for that so is he trying to\nWalk a tightrope between touting his economic success while at the same time firing up his base for the midterms or he sees his he simply stepping on

consistent but you know the house is really being determined the swing districts right these are these are places bottom or places that you know Hillary Clinton won and track but they managed to hold on with a Republican congressman so\nThose places are Trump's popularity just not very popular and you know they can go and make the case that look you can retire early now because the recall and case

the boys are more likely to report being victims you'd folk cranks ingenious to disco talks with the studies author\nGina banks Chris\nA new study shows teenage boys not and girls are more likely to report being the victim of violence from the person they date and the study indicates that overall fewer teenagers say they've suffered physical abuse from their date as compared to ten years prior\nJoining us now to explain what this all means is senior study author Elizabeth say WIC professor and director of the University of British Columbia school of nursing\nProfessor does this mean boys actually receive more physical violence than girls are just that they reported more\nThat's always hard to say essentially this study would say that more boys Ruthie Mile Island at least in terms of reporting that they have been hit laughed or physically her on purpose\nBy their girlfriend in the past year compared to girls it's not a huge number thankfully we see about five almost ... percent in Boise compared to just ... percent and girl button that difference has been persistent that in lately\nBut that difference has been persistent that is slightly more boys than girls have been reporting over the past ten years that they had been hit slapped or physically hurt on purpose by their romantic partner\nAnd this is a surprise on a number of fronts for one thing how many boys want to admit that their girlfriend is beating them up\nThat is one of the things that we see because this is an anonymous survey in school and this was in grade seven to twelve so you're basically twelve to Eighteen year old\nBecause this is a survey that is anonymous and kids are not looking over each other's shoulders there may be more willing to be on it and that kind of a survey then they might if you were asking them in front of all their classmates but this is one of those interesting questions\nWe also can't tell how frequently\nThe violence happens or how severe it might be so in this case you know this is one of the limitations it could be that boys are more likely to experience being hit slapped and physically hurt\nBut girls when they are physically hurt by their boyfriends might experience more severe injury we don't know\nThis is a school based survey that tries to get at the number of kids and not necessarily able to ask all the details about the context of that violence\nAnd do we conclude than that in some quarters it's still socially acceptable for girls to hit boys\nIt certainly is possible I've heard from a number of high school teachers since this study came out\nThat talk about how they clearly gotten the message that it's not okay for boys to hit girls but that they even witness in the hallways it's perfectly okay for girls to slap or hit or punch their friends and people aren't actually making any comments about it or trying to intervene\nThis does suggest that we have to do more to actually provide better training about healthy relationships were boys and girls and to really help change those norms about what's okay when it comes to relationships\nOther than the immediate physical effects such as perhaps and bruising what long term effects can result for a teen who's been the victim of violence from a date\nWell these patterns in the teen years can set the stage for adult relationships we know that young people who experienced violence in their relationships\nAnd this is often linked to long term mental health challenges as well young people may experience emotional distress depression even suicide or self harm and of course if this continues into adult relationships where they're more likely to experience violence from their adult partners\nThen again you have long term mental health consequences fortunately it's a small proportion of teens and it is declining this is one of the first studies that it's actually been able to look at trends in dating violence where we can go back ten years and see that in fact\nThe race are coming down a little bit and that's good news but we still have more to go no team should be experiencing violence in their relationships\nAnd picking up on that and do we know why the violence has dropped overall\nWe can't say for sure but I Do think that some of it has to do with the program but do get offered in some school where they talk about healthy relationships\nAnd talk about dating violence trying to change those norms about dating violence and so I think that may have contributed certainly conversations on the Internet and you know Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and others\nThat do talk about what people deserve in relationships and went healthy relationships look like may be contributing to this change\nWhat role does bullying play and the violence among teens who date\nI Do think that in some cases the folks who are engaging in bullying are just as likely to be engaging in\nViolence in terms of their personal relationships or romantic relationships so the young person who is going to say snarky things in public about other people may also be making those same kinds of controlling\nAnd negative comments in their romantic relationships\nI think a tolerance for violent is one of those things where young people who turn to violence when they're frustrated or as a way of solving their problems may be more likely to be involved in dating violence as well\nSo believe me the more likely to be involved in dating violence but I think they are different circumstances and it's important to recognize that we need to identify how to manage conflict and how to have healthy relationships whether those are those intimate relationships or just general friendship\nHas the beach to move that had an impact on whether there's less violence among teens who date\nThat's a good question and one we can't answer yet my hope is that the conversation that's gotten started has created an opportunity for more Frank conversations throughout adolescent communities as well and that people can actually\nCreate some useful dialogue around what healthy relationships are how people perceive sexual harassment and sexual violence and what we need to do as a society and as young people in creating those opportunities to have healthy relationships\nDiscussions I Hope among parents and their children are there enough resources to help them have that important discussion the parents and the kids\nI think there are a number of resources on the Internet in terms of healthy relationships and there's definitely a variety of groups I Do think it is important that parents teachers and even other adults can help prevent that dating violence by talking about healthy relationships even before the first day\nProfessor Elizabeth say WIC thank you so much for joining us today\nYou're very welcome for info track I'm gene that's a desk all listening to info truck a production popes implication that works

working\nInsane hours yeah you're just you're so exhausted phoning it in is really sometimes the only option\nBut unfortunately for me I don't know how to do that right I Would love to I could have made a lot more money and you know I could have probably not been as so stressed out throughout the ... to me\nThat wasn't what it seemed like from the dark\nI mean to me it really seemed like it was his own little\nFilm its own little blockbuster movie every week so I Would have\nMay be kind of lost interest if that's the way it continued bank like it was so great for what it was I was like man to join a full on films every week you know how do they do this phoning it in I don't think for the fans was ever an option I'm Sorry to say but now\nRight now and season three to me it seems like founding it in five try to watch and it's not the new guys really his fault there's they bought a new guy and\nWho I don't know he's from Iraq or something and now he's sort of a partner with your old partner who still can't get over you uh which I thought was interesting in that very first episode [laughter] like God is\nGreat you know I was lucky I worked with re McKinnon for four seasons on rectify and we were under the AMC umbrella so we were on Sunday which channel and\nNo one really kind of gotten our way creatively show and we weren't in the business of selling paper towels and cameras which is what we were in the business of at Fox right let's be honest and with on on Sundance channel we were really there in Charlie Korea who runs AMC he would look at us and say look guys\nI Love the show I'm going to make sure the shows on there until you're ready for it to end\nVery guys having that kind of leadership at the top it allowed us to really focus on the creative aspects I granted what rectify certainly nowhere close to lethal weapon ones blowing stuff up and running and gun and you can kinda do the laundry and watch right and and rectify certainly a slow burn that really kind of\nPulls you in and and and it is more like an indie film but what I learned working with ray was\nAs a performer and as an artist you sometimes\nWhat an actor's not think is more important than the words right and on network TV it's all about words words words words crime corporate crime and I was constantly kinda battling that trying to make this more by the creative piece because I felt we love lethal weapon the films because of it was a character in love with we I don't I Can't even tell you what\nThey were fighting the entire time what the crime was I I Know he was trying to buy cocaine at the very beginning of the Christmas tree parking lot outside of that we just love them to do matter what the backdrop was right and\nI felt like we didn't have that on the show from the material I was getting so it was really just this constant battle of trying to find that\nBut you got to understand that created a rift between me and the writers and that created a rift between me and again they wanted this boom boom boom look at a time to get it done get it and get it you go to write I don't think they want is that considered me some hick from Alabama out how to you know so funny he was so funny\nLike these people they pride themselves on being so inclusive and you know there's so tolerant of\nEvery thing yet they stereotype everyone especially Alabama there are still in the bubble they have no idea what's going on in the real world like they put the worst on everything\nWrong but I Would go to some of the social media sites where they were trying to push this narrative that claim Crawford is a emotional terrorists that things like that and I was just laughing because\nI Know it's completely untrue and they're planting people trying to push this to justify their decision on how they caved to a huge ego I happen to know someone who was a VP for ABC she loved to rectify you've never had wine issue on\nAny set and so for this all of a sudden to come up I'm like that's ridiculous and said that I I was like fishes don't all the S. and then I'll go in there and I'll start reading my he's from Alabama well you know Alabama\nOut he likes the Cranston tad [laughter] I Do love dumb and others corrupt yet especially this year\nOkay I'm going to be claimed Crawford from ... oh okay okay here I Am ... you you know that you can't take us on the radio that right [laughter] yeah yeah yeah I'll give it a shot\nSo here I Am back in Alabama with my wife and kids and my mom Lenny living within a mile of my extended family and I am so thankful that I'm not doing this show anymore but I'm\nVery thankful for such a high profile than it did give me because what's gonna happen down the road is I'm hoping that this and picking the out like you said is going to put me in the perfect position for my next project coming up look I\nAfter rectify which are my wife we were watching the national championship game Alabama versus Clemson and um and the and I looked at my wife and I said you know I don't think I'm gonna do anything after rectify the season shopping with like a year off and I just want to spend time with the boys and a daughter right\nAnd literally two months later I got the call\nThere's an auto auto right and literally two months later I got the call with all these weapons so for us to be able to have this time\nAnd and I'm a little bit of a workaholic I mean I bought a farm for my time off right I Want to go work and cut up trees and in Bay who bale hay and feed my horses and the cows and I love hardworking makes me feel good at the end of the show\nAnd productive work like that you can see it with your hands\nThere's just there's something so rewarding about molding in shaping a piece yeah putting into your own vision\nYes I mean I Will get out because I I've done news and radio forever and so when I get out and I go Bush August gets the greatest\nFeeling in the world by around ... happy place I Love it rumble around ended in ...\nAnd some people go to some people meditate some people do yoga some people have all these things to escape for\nMe it's it's it's just manual labor we're doing\nThe lines from doing the lines out there hanging left at home right back in may and nobody's going to get me but by God I make sure it's perfect and that and I had an ... oh my goodness I just don't get it they just don't get it so yeah I'm grateful and I don't think I Would have taken time off so I'm happy to be here\nAnd I'm not going to do anything until after the holidays I Want to spend it with my kids and guess I'm I'm I'm grateful for the time I had there um and I hope you know my grandad said who's you know who was a ... of wealth is pretty bad this is a\nSenior no no no no no\nBecause and I will tell you I have a some other for as good I used to live in LA and I did a whole bunch of stuff with his duty as we did promotions with my radio stations I got to know a bunch of people there oh my God Damon Wayans has the absolute worst reputation someone that sent me something saying\nThey knew better they knew better why they decided to do that I don't understand and by the way their show runner is a no show show runner ... don't wander it went into complete chaos and they find well you know you have to have the show runner there too\nYou know see the stars everybody this kind of on track and moving in the same direction and a buffer between that and this charity and this is the person that takes the bullet and deals with it and goes over and hands it to the studio and you didn't have any of that\nLook you're working sixteen hour days sometimes and this is five days a week and sometimes the crew has to work on weekends to pick up certain stunts that we can't do in the middle of downtown because there's a work week rice I have to do it on Sunday so people are just exhausted yeah people are at the end of the rub so being on that a lot of times he was like being on the sideline up a football game when you're not doing well there's a lot of yelling\nThere's a lot of running there's a lot of hustling people are trying to figure things out and it is\nIt's frantic okay\nUm that is normal to take audio tape and to use that against someone is not normal [laughter] um no\nI I heard some of that audiotape show obviously out of context that it's almost like how could they even use that against you and it can be found all over the Internet and it's just ridiculous\nI think my language was certainly you know look I come from um I I grew up playing sports spin F bombs get dropped quite frequently and I have a an extensive military a family so language sometimes gets thrown around um\nBut it's never hurtful you know and I think for me certainly I wasn't trying to hurt anyone the day I was more or less just try and do a\nTo someone to do their job who gets paid quite a good bit of money to do so and it was it was just hindering not my performance at that point but the other actor who I feel so terrible for uh\nI understand that you would have been trying to do three pages for eight hours\nAnd there was found on the set and no one really was looking out for this young kid who's like got his first big scene or whatever and he's trying to cry and he's doing all this stuff and you finally just lost it because no one's helping to get this done well\nAnd it's it just became the norm that this was just how we're going to do is just sort of became frustrating but I think what's more the difficult aspect of it was is saying that to say that because they were always trying to justify their position there did their decision to get rid of me so to say that it was I was yelling and children were in the city\nOn the talk of north Alabama news talk W.

thought it was a reasonable\nThing to kick around was the idea of a false flag but it got to the point where people were saying there's got to be a Democrat has got to be a Democrat I tell you it's got to be it's gotta get get nobody I mean this is this is this is not helping the Republicans at all why why and uh I got an addict to Casey yesterday who\nUh I said I said come on you can't quit speculated about about which party he is because we don't know well now we know and I find a lot of you to be very very quiet we had it\nNow we know and I find\nA lot of you to be very very quiet we had a caller who called and said well I think this guy a is a set up the value of being framed and and uh uh what what's your name and where are you from any a hung up\nSo ... what's\nThe problem for those of you that are are you are you nervous about the fact that this guy appears to be somebody who is a a President Trump worshiper he's he's built a shrine to him\nHe's got a shrine of Robie's shrine in his band where you got all the photos and ... and everything else about about the president I talked about this before with you in some of you get really mad at me about this but I I Am blown away\nBy not just not just people who idolize Donald Trump but idolized Brock Obama\nEye for the life of me I cannot imagine\nIdolizing any of these people who are politicians\nAnd so we get no we get calls we get emails from people who have got Donald Trump when I got the same thing back years ago with with Brock Obama have got them on a pedestal\nI mean the Obama phone lady was just glorifying the man I mean I I go to church\nAnd I've never heard such were vacations in their church but some of you think that Donald Trump or some of you think of ... I don't know what I don't remember anybody idolizing George W\nI don't remember anybody idolizing Bill Clinton\nSo how did this get started because it's it's it's getting worse\nAnd there are people look at I ... the the term Trump's takes in a wide range of people um I've told you before I don't like the way he behaves but I like what is accomplishing very much I like a lot of the things he's doing\nBut I don't idolize the man\nI don't hate him I don't idolize him he's just a a a guy who won or to be a politician and he hit right at the right time with the right message same thing happened with Brock Obama came out from nowhere\nOkay okay yeah to me he was a senator and Illinois and a senator in the upper two years but not much background other than community organizer and people gravitated to him like he was the second coming\nSo\nOkay so you're really really really like President Trump\n\nDo you have bumper stickers and and signs and and things plastered all over your car\nEven then\nOkay\nI think it looks kind of ... but it is if you want to do with your car\nBut how do you get from there to somebody sending out bombs and that is where\nThis story as much as everybody is going to try to put a finger on Donald Trump and say he's responsible\nI can play for you for the next two and a half hours all the cuts from people on the left as well as people on the ride saying really bad stuff about the other person about the other side\nThere's lots of those soundbites so\nYou don't like it okay but they have the right to say those things you have the right to yell back at him quite bluntly but how do you get to the point where you you try to craft bombs\nThat's because when all is said and done here when you cut through all the smoke of this whole thing this guy is a mentally disturbed deranged individual and how he hooked on to a political\nArgument for his deranged when I don't begin to know the answer to that and I don't even know if the cycle grab a nose the cycle bubble battles though how to describe this but he's a he's a deranged man\nWho went off the charts on a politician\nI Can't blame the politician only blamed this man and his mental\nFloyd in California fly Floyd Hi welcome you're on the Tom Sullivan show\nI'm I'm doing good what's going on you know just kind of some kind of check I mean we got a problem and you get the fate\nFloyd you your your bones sounds like you're in so I Am where are you\nShare it better thank you thank you thank you yeah I just had to turn out the show that'll fit that ... that if they just kind of check I mean let's face it you know ...\n... ... if they catch that if they just kind of a check\nI mean let's face it you know he's obsessed over this like like some guys that are living in fact some guys who obsess over a woman you know they kidnap all that stuff that factory idiot\nYeah no he says that they are pretty good he's a stocker he's a Trump stocker a I guess you could put it in that saying\nThat that the fact that he doesn't know how to fill up\nYou know or doesn't really know how to make one to explode evidently because uh I worked for the post office here in Sacramento and we deliver to that\nThat post office oh well I'm a truck driver yeah um I don't know what that that nobody that I Know that hurt\nA lot that's the amazing part is that how many people in the postal service system had been exposed to these bombs that have been going through the mail that's got to be a huge number a huge number so\nI don't know how many more out there but I Would imagine the everybody has a post office has got to still be on their ... and ... because this guy is not sane whether he sent more out or not and at this point we don't have to kick well I suspect the one that arrived in I'm In Manhattan today could have been mailed\nFrom Florida three days ago four days ago sometimes it takes that long to get from Florida to New York on the on a male so especially sense of of of an odd shaped piece of mail which seem to take an extra\nDoubt they put it in and they put it in an aircraft so it's fitting that it didn't blow up in an aircraft yup coming from there to to California and uh come down in in a neighborhood\nAre you surprised\nAre you surprised that they caught the guys who were quickly are you surprised to the fact that he is on obsessed ...\nA\nRise that these that eat a a was caught so fast yeah but not really because ah the postal service has as its own investigators\nFBI when you got you got somebody that you're doing this kind of stuff in a bad in the belly prize and how fat people get picked up obviously 'cause it got picked up pretty fast yeah as far as him being a\nA Trump supporter I don't I don't write that surprised me that he dies or order or a Democrat and I'll be honest with you ... idiots and ... and ... people on both sides yeah\nYeah they are on that didn't matter what it doesn't matter what what uh what political affiliation he adds a crazy crazy yep\nAnd that's the that's where it starts in my opinion it starts there and if you're not mentally healthy you check in on something and you become obsessed with it\nYou just do it and I've seen I've seen mentally ill people that matter no they get they get locked in on something and and you can't shake them loose cannot ... so\nUh I don't know how that works but I've seen it many many times alright Floyd thank you very much appreciate the call a JPEG one thousand sends me an email you can find my email address by going to my website Tom

he put up to this by some troll are we going to find something like yeah somebody should send the Democrats mail bombs or by the way it was a website that shows that are making\nI don't know this guy

was going inside or a came outside whatever but anyway the reason why they did that was they did not want to use any sort of forced entry at the guy's residence\nAnd the reason why is because they want to preserve the residence or a evidence to find out whether or not or\nThe residents for a evidence to find out whether or not or is any a powder of any kind at when you are or use a device to blow open a door that has gunpowder runs they don't want to\nUh to get things mixed up as far as keeping it clean so that way now they get a search warrant they go over to his place they open up the door they don't have to busted open with some device and uh they can gather the evidence without a\nWithout painting or what they what they pick up a that's also why they took the ban uh and and covered it with a ... so that what was inside the van the evidence that would be in their hair's DNA whatever it might be a would be well preserved as well\nSo the ban is has been brought to a law enforcement building where they can inspect it inside now\nThey um\nThe other yeah the the the other thing about all of this as they wanted to make sure that the ban wasn't booby trapped\nSo it wouldn't be booby trapped if he was just stopping at the store to run in and run back out again they assumed and that's why they took him when he was not at home but took him out at this on his own store and the thing about the auto zone store the ties into all of this is that the kind of wire\nThat was used to make these bombs\nWas um automotive gauge whatever that means I Would think there'd be lots of different wires and in automobiles but the kind that if you wanted to buy the kind of wire that he used in those bombs allegedly\nA you'd go to an automotive supply store to buy that wire

high fives and fist bumps and everything out or it was unbelievable to let me let me go back\nSo you tuned out you said you haven't listened to me in two years but what you're saying you tuned out

great radio programming out there and for us to be on two hundred and sixty five stations across this great country is pretty cool and then a would like to say hello to everybody around port ... Washington\nK. O. N. P. A. M. fourteen fifty and one at one point seven FM we get so many great calls and emails from our friends in the Washington state area and uh keep 'em come in at a special hello to you or during this week in a special\nShoutout to station owner brown and Maloney and minority owner\nTired or loss thanks so much guys were putting us on the air port ... Dan is located in the beautiful north shore of the Olympic Peninsula about eighty miles or so North West of Seattle and it's also I'm a very short ferry ride across to another breathtakingly beautiful spot which is in Cooper Island\nBritish ... oh yeah I don't know if you've ever been up in that part of the world up wow is that spectacular yeah and you can see why people want to live up there yeah is just beautiful yeah not on the bed there quite a bit that that ride out to Vancouver Island can be a pretty lengthy little ride is not just a buddy of their does tails and limit ... yeah [laughter]\nBut but once you get there you don't want to leave us it is an absolutely beautiful part of the world\nOf hey let's see if we can do a few of these emails here you are on display is from Paul in Georgia are range would in the kitchen doesn't ... to the outside a U.S three circulates through a filter is that a problem if I don't have a a ... I had a problem if I don't have a gas so well\nYeah you know have the problem\nWith the re circulating when it when did they just going to outlaw that and uh just just go in and and I don't know but anyway the fact the fact that you don't have a gas stove well that's good news but not great news because the fans from just normal cooking included some pretty bad compounds that can be pretty dangerous to your health even\nIf they're created on an electric stove whales than elation becomes even more important if the stove is gas because the fumes given off as the fuel burns the best defense is a range could advance all the way to the outside not just in the addict\nBut if you have to use it to you have to really use it to be effective so make sure the fan is on any time to cook the opposite and use that for at least\nYou know ten minutes or so afterwards and it's a good idea to run the fan when you're cleaning to make sure those themes given off mining cleaning products also escape your in door air we talk about the indoor air quality all the time\nAnd this is a great example there and and certainly our friends at Brown new tone can provide you a lot more information on cleaning up your air\nInside your house you can go to ... dot com or Newtown dot com to be able to pick up a little information I it just seems to be a bigger problem or the awareness of it is getting more and more um widespread with the consumers understand in that ... inside there can be\nPretty bad right and that's why October's National Air quality month because you know we're moving indoors we're butting up the house are spending more time indoors and outside\nAndme or um you know adding more and more insulation putting in better windows cooking all the facts and that's all great to save energy but meanwhile what about their that's inside\nAll that moisture all the orders from cooking and ex sailing everything else that's you know the air's got to go somewhere so yeah nothing better than a\nReally good vent than in the bathroom in the kitchen and here's the key you have to use them faster on the street ... flipping them on or not doing any good so uh yeah use them and make sure they invented outside and as David mentioned never just rent them in the attic he's leaving the house is leaving the living space but not leaving the house\nRight ... hey here's another one from Maggie and listen to this this this town sandwich Massachusetts\nOh I Know sandwich that's out on the Cape relied through sandwich every time we go out to northeast I Am out on the Cape cod eleven sandwich that knows right next to mash pie\nThe northeast I Am out on the Cape cod eleven sandwich cross right next to mash pie it rarely here we have a little ... about ... sandwiches mashed\nPeace and weight wow already then well let's say at this has nothing to do with sandwiches or turkey or um Swiss cheese or anything it's a hot day any recent remove all of our window screens but before storing them away for the winter I Would like to wash them first any tips on how to get them good and clean and ready for next spring thanks\nA thanks my husband and I love your show well thank you Maggie we appreciate that if we can certainly provides you some great information here first of all if the screens are\nFairly small you can uh just use a about one of the inexpensive\nUm children swimming pool is one of the little tiny kitty pool yeah the little kid he pulls little molded thing they're um they put so solution in there and so I'm a little bit\nThen struggled with a kind of assault bristle brush and then a blast off with the you know the spray of your water hose of that makes it real easy especially when you're able to stack several of them ... be able to get seven or eight of them in there at one time depending on if there would framer aluminum frame\nThat's a great way to soak it out but Joe I recall that uh you you came up with a great idea and and it's an idea that I have used a number of times um is pretty simple solution to this involving what just for short two by fours\nA yeah oh you're talking about building yeah by just taking the two by fours and then you\nPutting plastic rain plastic around it that way you can build the frame\nTo specially like if you can't get to keep all big enough for your ... if you have some that are more um vertical more a rectangular or re long gated\nAnd then to be able to build that and then I mean you can use it to before usually too busy ... whatever you want to make as deep as you want the plastic I fill it with water nickels and dimes chair and not caution you very much\nBut man oh man does that ever I mean you can ... you know blow 'em up with water hose it's not going to make them as clean as as getting down into crevices of that screen and especially if you're a proactive homeowner like Maggie is here than uh than you really can make a big difference by doing that\nYeah they take forever the dry but the best that the trick is to tap him you know be careful with them but after you clean them and you can ... the best way to find the scrub them clean when they're sitting in the water to soapy water is just with a broom like a long handled boom you don't have to bend over in his suite the back and forth flip it over sweet back and forth\nBut then tap it when you pull it out tap it to get rid of the excess while because one of his cling to those screen they take forever to dry but the other simple solution I think I I shared awhile ago Danny as if they're not really dirty\nYou can only have to put them in water does use a household vacuum with a try yeah as long as the upholstery brush and you describe them scrub the frames and the screens yup obviously have to both sides and not get off most of the dust\nAnd then if you do that like every two or three years you might only have to soak 'em and water once every four or five years so I'll say a trouble I mean when you store um I have mine up on that I can always put them in\nUm big um trash bags or yeah or cardboard boxes 'cause you know they're just getting a dusty of just leave him say around but somebody who is your options either use water don't use what I Would start with just a vacuum and if those seem come if they come up clean then you know then you get a storm way dry as they are\nYeah that's a great proactive way of taking care of it and a lot of areas of the country are doing just like Maggie is doing that they know they you know it's getting colder in some areas of the country you know you're not going to be able to open those windows are very much anymore to allow that fresh air to blow through so\nGo ahead and use it as an opportunity to remove the screens it'll keep them from being damage or an certainly getting dirtier in that way it's nice and clean and ready to put 'em back on when spring rolls around and walk to remind you of the day is harder hotline one eight hundred non

Mr ...\nIs that it is on level and of course if you could fix the countertop that's great what best approach to this you think\nWell I'm seeing is email and he says that ... ten foot long and its slopes five sixty seven inch and you're right you don't want\nSome leaders setting your tiles especially subway tiles with all all those vertical all those horizontal lines being way out of level\nBut in my experience you're never gonna see five sixteen seven inch over ten feet you're just not going to say I would say set the tile right on the countertop and just follow it and make your cuts all the cuts that will be because otherwise you're going to be cutting tile and that's going to be noticed well in that first course\nAnd all the ... tiles that will be out of\nOut of levels so to speak will be hidden up underneath the cabinet and he mentioned a backup one saying where a\nTom mentioned setting the drought\nOn setting the ... on the bottom you don't want to set put grout under that tall with their ... tile meets a counter top right silicon yeah because those two materials are gonna move separately so\nYou know wherever you have tile meeting something else you know another material um you what you might silicone go but I Would set it right on the top of that first course right out you'll never noticed that being out of level over ten feet gas that's\nProbably the best way to go ... got to have a level or you will always notice actual you'll feel like the floors cricket or something you don't want that but maybe it is maybe Tom's crooked [laughter] it's getting

it to make it go away\nWhy yes I mean are either will have some texture I mean and that's not a heavy texture it's just a little bit like and it's not flat sheet rock\nAnd it's a texture and the

than the drywall well\nThere's a couple of different techniques that you can use 'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short\nStiff bereft of all that you know maybe twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide and you put the paint on and then you shouldn't drag that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of look like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and then let that dry and then\nPut it in a coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you could do something that's almost call it I guess it is actually called of the nation plaster but that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and furnishing at and rather than it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of\nCloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it um there's a slated texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the paint that makes that and that has um\n[noise] it really does look like sway that has that sort of like rubs softer not working texture to it there's a standard finished with there's actual fans in the pain sometimes I can feel a little rough almost like a sand paper\nBut I'm back of the nice texture to they all have different application technique so if I were looking at a paint that has a specific texture and homo center and make sure that I really read the directions and looked at what that manufacture was recommending for the application process and get those correct tools and do the proper prep work for it\nBecause some of those textures or you know kind of labor intensive for the wire and you want to make sure you get it right\nAbsolutely [laughter] okay well I Will look into the things you suggested here and make a decision then I Hope\nThat helps you out it does say something much\nWell now that we are entering heating season and maybe a lot of you actually already using the heat in full swing this time of year you really want to try and get the most out of your energy dollar and to do that you've got to keep that draft but those drafts aren't always just found really obvious places\nYeah now my favorite place that sneaky drips happen or switch bleach and outlets on each year your walls you know air gets into those walls and those address from the outside will just zipped right in the inside is there not proper we deal with the ... is very simple\nYou can pick up some pre cuts owned gas gets ... homes and there's and hardware stores are literally paintings of peace and then slip them under the cover place to do a great job of keeping those dress out\nI mean truly it's like one of the least expensive improvements they can make that will make a very new\nAnd I was out I mean truly it's like one of the least expensive improvement they can make that will make a very noticeable difference in your expenses which is just amazing to me the other thing if you find that you have a larger gaps exterior walls\nYou can try and fill up with an expandable phone and that's going to stop the Airflow but in a lot of cases it's not going to stop any road ends our pets from coming in and says he want to do that as well you can make them a little while just to sort of strengthen it up and keep the little voting ads from chewing their ...\nYeah good point so lots of ways to try to cut back on those traps but I'll tell you what did you add up so given them now before I could see terribly cold it'd be a lot more comfortable all winter long and you've got the money out there today\nI got to issue with the leaking feeling I'm not sure if it's coming from from my roof for from our conditioners doesn't do it all the\nTime but sometimes when it rains it comes down to the top ... [laughter]\nOr or or ... that allows we've got a metal roof structured house right I'm thinking maybe the grip they get there you don't want more goes into the gutter and you know the box that I've not had any luck because I have it fixed and then it it will come a rained and becomes then again\nIt comes in again right so what they're doing the fiction that he was stealing the scenes in the in the metal roof\nYeah we we got up and put a some talk of the stuff on ... you know where to edge stuff was and it was supposed to be a twenty year roof and we had another house rather\nWait a minute there's metal roof is supposed to be a ... roof metal roof last a long time here's what I Would do I would try to make it so I Would go up there can you get up there that area with a hose yeah so I Would try to make it leaks I Would try\nYou know the normal light duty rainfall when it falls down from the top and see that there's anything and then I Would try some directional pressure\nAgainst those seeds and see if I can figure out what type of driving rain storms coming in your ... I suspect that is do the rain\nOr driving and those and it might be trapped in there and it's way be comes out days later after ... I don't know\nBut I I think what you're gonna have to do is to try to figure out what part of that is breaking down and then once you do if you already going the Koch route I Would suggest taken apart that section of the roof\nAnd then putting it back together with the proper ceilings to make sure you get it done once and for all\nRight okay All right now we've got\nTo repair the Salem to or not or a proud to say on\nYeah no you don't want to you know you you got his gun and by the way when you do repair the ceiling and make sure use primer on it because if you don't prime over leaks things that they're going to come right through no singed paying guy\nActs like what we're going to do is put up a a little lip\nSobbing or a lack of not paying lame but it's a stoplight that'll go up and get rid of the popcorn up though right\nNow well ... you know that for most expensive wards and home improvement while you're at it [laughter] yeah All right there with a project thanks so much for calling us

the prairie of Kansas on the head and the way concrete porch\nBut this case hacking hacking did earthquakes we had a pretty good one a week or so ago\nAnd now it's really um level um some of the ...

on the local hardware store about ten miles and you know ... with\nWhat he or do you need concrete or back I don't know what the different car\nOkay so first of all the type of repair mature uses different type of material you would use if you were say pouring a new concrete slab and you mentioned quick read that's a great brand and they have a wide variety of repair products um you have the option to repair the cracks you could also re surface that concrete is a product for that\nAnd in all cases they the difference between that type of product a repair product and the original sort of concrete Prague is it the repair parts are designed to adhere to the original concrete base\nYou know if it's if anything is loose course shift to pop that out and restore it but I'm sure that there are plenty of concrete repair products that are out there and\nYou know you're going to obviously have to get yourself to hardware store or lumber yard and find that you can do some research on line that their website but you want to make sure you choose a repair product because it is designed specifically to adhere to those surfaces\nOkay thank you so much All right\nGood luck it eight six six

some things that we talked about that we can you can do maybe I'm\n... actually these are things that pay off for you than improvements at your home and I was looking for some things to talk about at least some great things you know one of them was what bothered them met that we always talk about that you didn't Persian how\nSimple Hank yeah a paint as ... painting front or read [laughter]\nThere you go that's a good segue there so but you know why it pays off which is why because paint provide as dramatic results with little investment so if you decide how professional do the work such a certain propane there's you know expect to pay thirty six hundred and six thousand furniture and have average American house about twenty four hundred square feet\nAnd extra job run about five thousand or more so one of the things that you want to do it as always asked for some help is not as okay an interior designer somebody who'd be matched inside outside you won't make sure that the roof\nAnd you know colored has got some kind of play in the in the in the uh extreme they're making sure you get him which goes you want to choose to paint the house and I I don't know about ... ...\nUm [noise] a favor inciting\nAt one time you know that was a big especially the new deciding that you can use now you know you don't even have to painted or even do any type of maintenance for twenty five years just as hard as concrete\nWhile yes what you just said it's funny you said that 'cause it's as a you know study conducted by remodeling magazine fiber scene meant siding\nWhich has made a ... and so he loves fibers and cause an average of Thirteen thousand two hundred dollars\nIs estimated to recoup about eighty eight percent and I hear that all the time now a lot of contractors are going to this is a hearty hearty plant board I think this what's called saying something like that you do a you know and vitals been improved and improve you know before maybe\nIt wasn't you'd be protected and that turned yellow and and then there was got hard and they can crack and it would split and war and the looming them tends to Denton fade I mean 'cause\nI if you touch the aluminum you put a dent in it\n[laughter] I remember the old aluminum siding you know it'd be like the color white after a while you would touch it and you'd get white powder on\nYeah that's absolutely right so you know I don't know if I mean I guess older homes older wouldn't homes if you want to not have to paint but then he got to be careful about the his hysterical society if you're in that area so you make sure you check with them about the you know it always what pays office building\nAnd I think you meant historical knowledge you say that I just went down there that I'm living everybody know what you are actually do me a minute I'm at the history oh his or\nAnd you know I feel sorry for those people because it go I mean wooden windows are expensive and they got a tremor mountain would and then I Do that all over and they fix some\nThey paying them and then the course of the pain fade into ... and then they go back up again where some people have come up with things that looks like would but it's it's it's a plastic material and it lasts forever but they won't let them put that in\nJust not hysterical\nIs right [laughter] so uh building a deck always pays off you know it's always nice you can go out and says Allen your deck and a a\nGreat colors to paint and now they have nice concrete paint kind of stuff that my mother put on hers and it was just an excellent choice it sells ah [noise] you know fills in the ... the gaps in in a has little\nA tourist powder in it too so you won't slip and slide when it rains and ... it was excellent to to do that sort of hers uh what always pays off as updating the kitchen now guys do you spend more and more time in the kitchen or less and less\nA year\nNow it's been more and more time in the kitchen or less and less\nUh you know over here not too much time and it gives them down all the time you\nJust when you need something to eat Hungary but I mean I mean what's there to spend time in the kitchen\nWell I don't know I've been

meat chicken or fish or\nOr beef and then uh some fresh fruit and this prepare meals and stuff and and we haven't done that yet [laughter]\nOkay so you're spending a lot more time\nIn the kitchen and

out there but they sure a few tips on some of those right now you need to be sure you got one slicing and ensure be sure because that that's a\nThat's a tough job right there if you get the wrong person that they're cutting the tree down it falls on your house a lot of damage is done who pays for it also one of the things you need to look for is after the tree is cut down\n... somewhere in the clauses says that they will ... a grind stumped for you but you don't have to have extra hundred or two hundred dollar charge for that that's the biggest misleading things right there\nWill tell them why that they want to make sure that their license insured\nYes because you know if that happens in your insurance company doesn't cover\nWell that's the problem if they get hurt and they don't have insurance and they're on your property then they're going to go to your insurance company and you got to go\nYeah I've never understood why if you hire somebody and this guy's working for this company you hired he doesn't have insurance and something happens to his worker then you're responsible why why is that he was on his job with his employer why am I responsible for that it just makes no sense to me\nWell that's true and why is it if\nYou're going to visit the neighbor's house and you walk across somebody's yard and trip and fall and fall on her stomach hurts so you can sue that neighbor and get your money I mean it's only shouldn't have been in their yard that's right\nBut I don't know if that's the lawyer side to make money or an insurance I wouldn't be 'cause they're gonna lose money mhm but a ... that's a good question\nAnd he is going back to what Bob he's talking about about the ... uh you don't want to hire somebody who is not license\nAnd insured because you don't want to treat to fall on some structure to your property and then go oops and hop in the truck in here\nAnd you know make that cut make that cut and they thought it was supposed to follow this way and it falls on your neighbors car\nEven ... even worse than that some of them have been cutting trees down here in this uh you know there's the some of the weather here lately here and it's been hitting the power lines when that he has there's a lot more than a lot more houses without electricity that's your fault move things forward or they're not sure about who pays for the damage there yeah\nIt was a Saturday about till seven months ago oh we'd finished house of cards I had been back home and my wife and I have a little lunch\nAnd the power went out beautiful sunny day well what happened then I'll look down and now do you have underground utilities or do you yes well my neighborhoods a little bit older and we [noise]\nSo you got me now yeah okay and\nI look out and the power lines are just shaky and I'm like okay maybe that's one of the ... ... ... email look down the street in neighbor was cutting a tree and it fell on the power lines and luckily it didn't bring 'em down but it made a\nMade the break or throw somewhere but they had found fix\nAnd that's I take that back to my house are to how these two houses\nIt was somewhere but they had found fix well and that's I take that back mad at my house are to how these two houses the one next door to us was added after the subdivision was developed so yes we have above ground lines but I see a lot of new subdivisions which I think is very smart\nIt's all underground and then comes into your house in ... and now when you have cold weather or actually ice you're freezing or somebody missed cuts they're not falling over power and so I think that's\nOver the years you'll probably see that get better and better on that\nKinda stuff ... so that's what you always hear when there's like an ice storm coming somewhere dry it in the you know the power lines and the trees are going to vote he was\nA rural don't drive over don't try to step over don't go around that don't go near it just like you don't go into the water over the road because we don't get swept away\nSo I you know and also another thing that is when you're cutting tree down I have a professional do it you know\nBe sure that they know exactly what they're doing because think about it a lot of these trees they ... they won't cut down right after big hurricane storm and the trees are when when they when the weight of them is like three or four times the original wait oh that was going to watch out of that and I didn't write\nHey what about the guy that I've seen so many what America's funniest videos or they cut it then they go I got is going to go right way to look and all of a sudden going the opposite when they're running into this crashes the house or\nA car or you know are actually hit some people I mean and I have you seen those loans are there on the ladder and they're cutting the branch and it cuts and the hits and then it flips and knocks ladder down and I mean you know it's I don't know I'm too old for all that now\nYeah but you like to look at the video and I do you know I mean you go there's some things you say about those people\nAnd when somebody is holding the branch Dana guys cutting it and then the Pam Knox so I'll just be careful out there are professional\nThat's probably the best thing you could do I mean if you're handy and go for it but you know the best best just hire somebody who is license and insured and they can take care of it for you and you don't have to worry about it all your dues right to check their ego Bob yeah\nOkay that's the thing in the news like I mentioned at the

forty two percent of patients spending all of their money which amounts to about a hundred thousand dollars\nSo not only his cancer toxic for your body but the financial toxicity\nA which is very evident with this letter on a car oncologist from eco Chino to co writer research letter\nHer husband's surpassed his insurance policies five hundred thousand dollar lifetime limit you drained her savings to pay for his treatment when he died she was left with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt that's a story of hundreds and thousands of cancer patients all across the country\nMore bankruptcies are caused by people in their medical care than anything else\nSo what do you do is they review of forty five different studies published in the journal of the national Cancer Institute finding that up to sixty two percent of patients who were aboard being in debt\nMore than they can pay for as a result of a new treatments as another study of five thousand patients discovering the fifty five percent a crew over ten thousand dollars in debt three percent filed for bankruptcy the costs for cancer and our country eighty billion dollars a year you think\nThe cost for cancer in our

don't know what the answer is but it sure is not a great situation I'm reporting to view on it\nOn a good day health program high so jak Stockwell here with Jack staffing again a reminder about the podcast you can review a lot of the conversations we have here there are archived a good day how show\nDot com and jak services are at forbidden Dr dot com the products that he has the services that he offers to help that he gives to people it's all about service\nHere's a headline\nAnd I just I'm looking at this and it looks like so\nBut I Want to throttle on these people um the headline reading this morning I'm reading a um a one of these financial news sites that looking ahead to stocks that you should be buying by cancer diagnostics stocks\nMassive growth now one wonders whether\nThat's a good or bad buying the stock to diagnose cancer I guess that's good because they will help people treat their cancers we all know that the treatments there the fix for cancer has long since been known but it's not good for business so that's why so many people are dying of cancer and that's a very cynical look at it but it's the truth\nI I completely believe that because it's a five to six billion dollar your profit center for the medical world they don't want to get rid of cancer or any more than the American Heart Association really wants to get rid of heart disease\nSo when you see something like bad jak though what is it what what what is said to use these devices treatments that bring profits to shareholders on the backs of people who are sick and I guess that's\nWell I guess if you're looking for a stocks that have you know for the last fifty years great potential for growth you're going to be buying stocks in pharmaceuticals and the very thing that you were just describing because we are a drug consuming nation now if you can do that\nAnd not feel like a I mean still be able to go to sleep at night you know I guess that's your business but um [noise]\nWhat what's important to a good capital return on your stock investments are being able to sleep at night I I agree with you it's a it's a conundrum there is no issue about it\nIt's not a difficult or it's a rather difficult decision for some people to make a lot of people who are ... wrapped up in mutual funds and they're wrapped up in a different kinds of stock investments that include a whole myriad of stocks\nAnd I think anybody who looked into their portfolio closely what noticed that they've invested in pharmaceutical stocks because they return well\nSo you know I mean what is this your after you after a better cleaner world and healthier population are you interested in the better bottom line that\nLosing weight and making money seemed to be the two greatest prerogative some her country and western society in societies where you don't find a proliferation of degenerative diseases that are often triggered by high stress levels that doesn't seem to be as big a concern is having a nice big

mind\nHere's\nJenny enjoying welcome to pop parenting a weekly show where we encourage any quid families to parents on urban\nParenting means raising kids with the end result in mind it means a lot of our kids intentionally\nThem into a purposeful adulthood I'm Jodie hanging then I'm Jenny still men were coming to you today from the beautiful Gulf Coast of sunny Florida and we are thrilled that you decided to join us here today we hope you'll take a moment to come visit us on the Web at Jenny and Jodie dot com and while you're there be sure to drop us on line and let us know what you thought of the show\nToday we are continuing uh theories on helping our kids develop emotional intelligence\nResearch shows that emotional intelligence is the strongest predictor of success in the workplace in fact the Harvard Business review says it is the key attribute that distinguishes outstanding performers\nIt's often referred to as each cue for emotional quotient and it's more important in many ways than a person's IQ so throughout this month we're going to talk about for vital components to a person's IQ you and how to help our kids develop each one\nIn today's episode we are talking about helping our kids raised their social awareness so that they can raise their overall IQ you stick with us for the hour\nFor that conversation first we hope that you enjoy our intro music and if you did be started checkout brother brother they are a two man in the Americana band comprised of brothers ...

N. N. Y. A. N. D. J. O. D. Y. dot bomb welcome back to pop parenting if they're just getting in we are continuing a theory today kc become\nEmotionally intelligent and in today's episode we are talking about helping kids raised their social awareness\nIn the first segment of today's show we discuss what social awareness is so if you missed part of the show because you're just tuning in or if any for any reason you have to go before the show is that the shore to head over to Jenny Jenny dot com and drop us ally and we would gladly help you catch up on anything that you invest\nIn this segment we're going to talk about how we can use media to help our kids developed social awareness so one thing we're always saying too much too much but we can really use that to help\n'em media is just a tool that I mean and it can be abused like any tool like money you know money is neutral it's not their good or bad it's how we use it that really makes a difference in the same thing with me it's either good or bad neither good or bad\nIt's how we use and and what we choose to view on it that can be good or bad guy and a major part of social awareness is the ability to feel and develop\nEmpathy and then nothing that media can really help with um this is very interesting it was something that we talked about earlier in the show Amy ...\nBook president excuse me well heck up there [noise] um presence and ... in it in that book she talks about how one of the ways that we understand\nOther people's emotions is by subtly very suddenly so suddenly we don't even know we're doing it\nMimicking their facial expressions and body language and it's in that mountain that nano moment microsecond of mimicking that we\nSay oh it's like the life of oh they're feeling sad and it's only as we've mimic that tennis and actually what's really fascinating about this\nIs that they've done some studies and people who have Botox have had ... their face and can't make ... certain facial expressions [noise] um I have greater difficulty identifying emotions and other people because they can't make that emotion with everyday\nSo crazy you know when when we first discovered this one of the things that I cracked up about as I thought about things like you know when you're feeding a baby in a high chair\nAnd you're on the air here comes in your mouth is open like you're going to eat at it so rarely watch\nTV I'll walk in the living room and my husband he is notorious for watch TV and totally facial expression of what's happening I can watch them and know what's going on we even the\nRat and now it's true we really do do\nYeah and so um\nThe way that we can you there's a variety of different ways we can use media but but it all comes down to conversation I mean that's really the crux of all this with our kids that we want to constantly talk about what we're seeing\nSo we're watching a movie were watching TV with our kids and we can talk about you know okay ... did you notice that little facial expression what did that expression\nOkay ... did you notice that little facial expression what did that expression just tell us that expression that she's hiding something and they seemed in on it and they really wanted us to know she's hiding something so what does it look like to you well well and what would you call that\nFacial expression you may call it being you know secretive deceptive um maybe nervous maybe anxious ah and what does it look like how could you tell\nYou know it's interesting because um this has happened today I was with a little Ari and my granddaughter and she was watching a show and you know how the kids react to their little shows they watch and she was like oh and I said to her I said why are you scared because that car had an accident\nAnd she said yeah like it's even from that a ah that you can talk to them and and help them understand what emotion there feeling and what's happening\nYeah yeah I'm a another thing that we can do is in real life situations when our kids um you know ... to ... let's say they're using social media and they see that you know something\nUnfortunate maybe has happened you know friends or whatever the situation as it doesn't even necessarily have been fortunate but whenever they can detect that there's something emotional going on um we can we can talk to them about how they might feel in\nThat same situation so um something that happens in social groups all the time as kids get left out yeah um and parents have a really important role to play when that happens especially if you're a kid as someone who got left out mhm um or if your kid is the one doing the leaving out\nOn either way it parents can can really play a big part some parents try to jump in and fix the situation which I'm ... and when I think don't try and and make it better but\nDon't leave out that the conversation component you know I really don't you know ... just fix it like really talk it through if you're a child was left out of something we we want to say hey remember um how this feels and think about that in the next\nOpportunity you have to include people I and maybe and maybe help them think about think about a person who you wouldn't leave out you know somebody you wouldn't invite your party why why didn't you will and she might say\nWell it was on her way courage to said she doesn't know any of the other people and it might be really awkward and and and then you can say maybe they're feeling that way too you know\nJust helping them to really dry and it's conversation is really the key to all of it you know another important part of social media to is when you're with your kids in front of their Facebook or Instagram Snapchat and all that jazz is\nAsking them questions like the things that their friends are putting out there that really what they're trying to convey are they giving sending the right message and is that what they want to convey when they put their stuff out there because\nI think half the time they don't really realize what's going out they don't understand what this says and what's this expression is ... ... of themselves as saying to the masses absolutely I think it's\nSo important that we have kids be really aware of of the messages the social messages and ...\nThat they're sending by the way if you're just tuning in this is pop parenting with Jenny and Jodie and we're talking all this month about helping our kids raised their emotional intelligence and today's episode we're focusing specifically on the idea of social awareness\nOn when we're watching TV and movies um we can ask our kids if they think that the actors that they're watching look authentic yes you know have you ever seen somebody made that expression do you think that's realistic do they do a good job of showing that offers a bad acting [laughter] um have you felt that way do you think that's\nHow you look when you feel that way mhm it it's just an opportunity it's a jumping off point in an opportunity for us to really um you know say what's going on and we can make it really light hearted I grew up in the house with my grandmother um was really\nLike you Jody she liked to do a lot\nBut it was really kind of interesting because what she would do is we'd be we'd be in the middle of watch we always watched things together and ... and we were talking about it and we'd be in the middle of something really intense right like a really heart felt moment or really sad moment and my grandmother would say\nI Wonder if that character to start to laugh right now [laughter]\nAnd it's like you she would bring up the most socially inappropriate thing though I Love it but it's great because you only causes you to it it causes you to back up and think about the emotional ... happening in that moment\nI think this is something that we can really do with our kids to when we read to them all together and we read stories and we can talk to them about\nHow characters are feeling and and okay now we don't have anything to look at how do you know they're feeling that way right what what are some of the word that the author used that led you to believe that and and do you think that there do you agree\nWith how they're handling the situation we're going to head out to a short break but when we come back we're going to continue the conversation about helping kids raised social awareness with a discussion about teaching our kids can question and listen you're listening to pop parenting with Jenny and Jodie and we will be back in just a moment\nYou haven't experienced yogurt until you've tried among the

is that I Would always say the ... are you OK or what was the question I always ask you I Can't even think it's like I never asked before um like like what can I Do well\nWhat can we do to fix it and I'd be like\n[laughter]\nAnd then I'm the opposite because whenever you ask me that I'm like\nYou know that's not what you ask me you say is it what can I Do what can I Do and I'm like it makes me mad because I'm like I\nUm I I have a I have a friend recently who is really sad and and she's the person who's pretty powerful and she doesn't expect that motion like this off and she's not a person who falls apart regularly ... she's got her life pretty well together that she was she was really falling apart and I looked at her and I said okay\nAre you the kind of person who wants to hug when you feel like this or no and she was like no and I thought Oh thank heavens [laughter] because me either and I\nDo not want to give you a hug but at the same time we don't want to be insensitive right and if the person they're just sitting there and feeling like I'm not\nWell you know I was gonna say when we were talking about this one of the things for me it's it depends on the situation sometimes I Want to hug and sometimes I don't want anybody to touch me\nAnd to Penn so so really the only way to know that is to ask\nThe person and that's a great way to say hey I'm are you the kind of person who wants to talk about it or do you do you want to go do something to help you forget about it do you want to maybe be alone and\nThinking through like I just I just want to be the best friend that I can write in this moment um and then let them tell you\nI Wonder how I can let me know if there's something I can do\nYeah on the more our kids learn to interview the people around them the more socially aware there'll be calm and like I said it will be able to apply apply that to other situations\nThey'll have\nSome finesse started to develop and how they approach um different people and and knowing how to handle a different kinds of situations but ultimately we want to teach our kids when you see something ask the person with any if the person's super excited\nLike what do you want to do you want me to you know you want to celebrate you want to talk about it you know you really want to know what it is that they need in that situation question really is the best way because you love them answer\nLet them tell you that's it yeah\nWe're going to head out to a break but don't go away because when we come back we're going\nUp the show with a very special segment that we're calling

figure out any solutions\nGo internally to realize how you got there what's the point of this whole thing what are you supposed to learn what's the real reason what's behind the curtain this was a powerful stuff okay it doesn't have to be a toxic relationship it's only a toxic relationship if you stay\nAnd you'll figure it out or if you run from it and you get into another toxic relationship and go wow this one was worse than the last one you know all of this one wasn't as bad but there were these issues too\nOkay we'll have you ever thought about why keep getting the same type of relationships with the same type of ... the same type of problems\nInteresting okay do you think that you could actually have a part to be played in this very interesting and it's so are you willing to look at that part because often it's easier to look at the other part that the other person's plane instead of the part that we play\nAnd and so it can be just as simple as the\nFact that you grew up around this type of reality you grew up around a mom or dad that was very similar to your current boyfriend girlfriend husband or wife\nOkay and it's a normal thing it's normal not that it's healthy I didn't say healthy I didn't say this is so great I said normal and so often what happens is when things go wrong\nWhich they do and what we call a toxic relationship we look to to find the problem with the other person instead of looking with end of the term in how we got there\nAnd why we're accepting this type of relationship and our life\nI mean some of you got to step back and go why my end is what am I doing it\nI mean why my accepting this why would I accept this why would this be acceptable behavior why would this be acceptable relationship because it's been acceptable in the past because you've dealt with it in the past where did you deal with it in the past and a past relationship before that where did you deal with it before that\nBeing raised upbringing remember like there's a lot of things that are cyclical okay until we break the cycle we can't make the changes and how do we break\nWhen we break the cycle we can't make the changes and how do we break the cycle\nWe break this cycle by identifying the pattern okay we break this cycle by identifying the pattern so identifying the pattern is pretty powerful stuff\nAnd if we can identify the pattern to to stop the negatives cycle wouldn't be a positive lesson in our life\nWouldn't that be a big change in our life would not helpless graduate into another thought process wasn't that help us take care of ourselves be better people to ourselves love ourselves more understand ourselves more get more out of this life yes\nFor more information call one eight eight eight nine eight nine wave one eight

deliver to live perspective\nThan I Am your host asked the birds\nToxic relationships were talking about today how can you turn a toxic relationship\nInto a positive lesson a positive learning lesson\nFor your life I Know we often talk about the pain in the pitfalls and all the tragedy about a toxic relationship but it's toxic relationship is only tragic when you stick in it and you don't learn anything about yourself\nA toxic relationship is a big time learning tool\nThat can contribute to really changing your entire life\nIt can empower you it can be the empowering thing that you need to get over that hump and what I call the ... is the cycle the negatives cycle the cycle that you've been living when we can identify the patterns that cycle we can break the cycle\nSo I feel like a toxic relationship ever looked at in the right correct empowering light can actually help you to identify the negative patterns in your life they can actually help change your life forever\nAnd I know that that sounds crazy and I know it's a new thing but I Know I\nJust figure this out recently and I want to share this with everybody 'cause I've been thinking about this for a long time\nAnd I've realized from my own life how I was successfully able to transform what I Would consider toxic situations talks are relationships and a very powerful powerful relationships and I think it's something that we really need to talk about and today show\nRight before the break\nI was talking about why we do it like why we get into these toxic relationships in the first place but you think about it it's it's kind of both sided here we get in it because we don't want to be alone or could have tendency were cut some of it from our childhood\nOkay we're accustomed to funding problems in the other person to a lot of times because we don't realize how we got there we see them as the toxic one not necessarily ourselves but it does take two to tango now like when I was saying right before the break is there is a bit of mirroring I understand that some people are not able to take or\nNo scratch that he's not and will not take responsibility for anything that they do any of their actions\nOr anything and that is not a good situation and in that situation you can say one person is more toxic or not able we're not going to work to help the relationship definitely a big red flag however what I'm saying is that we can also mirror each other is a lot of marrying going on even though one person might be projecting a fun house mirror that\nSeems a little over the top and what I mean by that\nThat you know if two people are coming from kind of a same difference between ...\nAnd where there is a little bit of mirroring as well as as the fact of like anger or resentment or maybe a personality disorder or what have you there might be some mirroring there that if we really kind of look into that and we and we don't judge the other person for just a little while we don't judge at all we can\nDid that and we we don't judge the other person for just a little while we don't judge at all we can we begin to realize how we might have connected with that are\nThere parts of the laws that are like that is there is there ... all of us had tendencies\nThere's you know we're all part of the part of the whole thing you know it's not like we're all independent out there was none of the same um personality\nTraits that we can all have some of that and so some people might be Mary knows they might be more code of and that\nIt might be more obvious okay they might be more insecure you might be more obvious they might be more narcissistic him out and be more obvious what whatever it is but it it you can understand that without judgment you begin to understand\nPerhaps a little bit of the learning tool of what we're supposed to learn but also what we need to learn about ourselves [noise] so what are some of the things that we don't really realize we're in this type of toxic relationship okay\nThe first thing is that to realize that they themselves are not the problem you yourself are not the problem\nYou are the solution and they are the solution if you realize it but I'm not talking about the solution to necessarily stay together solution the solution is said to understand the value and understand oneself and that is the true lesson\nOkay and that's what I'm Talking about it and just staying together and going to make their relationship work should the relationship together probably not\nBecause both people need to learn about themselves both people need to take some time out and figure out what makes them tick\nHow do we get here how we play in the cycle out again and where did this cycle come from why did this feel so normal to me okay and that's a big consideration why did this field so normal to me\nAnd that's something that you really want to think about because it came from somewhere it started somewhere\nYou know one of the biggest things that I find is that instead of like trying to learn from the situation we want to change the situation we want to fix the situation but we want to start fixing the situation by fixing them\nOkay I'm going to fix them they are there's something wrong with them we need to fix them but we're not on this planet to fix other people besides herself\nOkay\nAnd I found that when we go within and realize hey you know it's not about fixing them it's about ... me and figuring out not just fixing me it's not about fixing it's about awareness\nWho am I what do I stand for what's important to me what do I love what do I value do\nI Love myself can I Love myself can I unconditionally love myself what does this mean and all these things need to be taken into consideration and understand very fully\nUntil really trying to bridge the gap with someone else in a relationship because someone in the relationship has got to understand themselves pretty well\nIf we don't and we're both going in with a lot of baggage willy nilly we're gonna continue to have the same problems over and over again\nI'm sure you've had a friend maybe yourself who was in a relationship got out of a relationship got into another relationship and the same stuff started happening again it was like the same type of deal\nWell it's not that the person that they got what is the same person it's just that the baggage that was brought into the relationship from both sides is very similar\nThe relationship the baggage was never figure it out into the relationship and never had a chance to be healthy because the unhealthy baggage was not actually gone through and prioritized by the individual who owned the unhealthy baggage\n\nWe can only break the unhealthy cycle by identifying the pattern and that's what these toxic relationships are therefore it's not that the universe hate\nYou God must hate me oh my gosh\nGod must have me 'cause I'm In another horrible relationship it just shows you that I'm not cared not care for is that really the case\nOr is it the fact that you keep going down the same the same path with not taken into consideration anything from the past not dealing with any of the baggage going into the same type of deal not changing the cycle not understanding the cycle not seeing the patterns are being\nAware of it finding all the fault in the other person and and ending the relationship and then before learning about self jumping into another relationship and then in a few months wondering why that is not working\nOkay very valuable information\nI think also a very interesting thing is that they are teaching us\nAnd what we learned depends on what we learn about ourself okay so these relationships and the individual even though the ... even though the individual might not be taking responsibility for their situation\nTheir teaching us a good example is if you're with somebody that you over you you have to over explain all the time was and I just did a video it's on YouTube right now it's about stopping over explaining\nAnd I I think that oftentimes a lot of folks who were animal we considered toxic relationships are constantly over explaining themselves\nBecause the other person doesn't understand them the other person finds faults and what they're saying the other person doesn't want to understand what they're trying to say and and there becomes like this whole cluster and what happens if the other person is over they're over explaining the whole time and then the other person is evaluating them and it becomes this constant toxic cycle\nPowerful kind of odd situation and I find that we get there because we really haven't learned anything about ourselves\nWe we haven't become powerful because in order to become powerful we have to actually step back and realize that until we understand ourselves we're powerlessness\n\nPowerless to find a happiness and so we agree that it belongs and sticks\nWith us powerless to understand that\nAnd it's not that we're powerless we just chosen not to have that we've chosen not to see it we've chosen\nWe've ignored it\nWe've chosen to care about what other people think about us more we've chosen to think about the ... and his relationship more we've we've chosen to look at this we've chosen to look at that when in reality\n\nWe need to be looking at ourselves and understand why am I chosen not to look at myself to love myself why allied chosen not to get to know myself on a very personal level why am I chosen not to see myself clearly\nWhy chosen not to do the personal work but I've chosen all these relationships with all these different people that's been a very similar cycle each and every time some less bad some more bad some you know some even abusive possibly\nWhy do I continue to go down that road why do I continued through the cycle well it's because we haven't learned about ourselves we're not willing to take the plunge we're not willing to spend the time and take the pawns on learning who we are and what's going on\nAnd do you see what I'm saying even at the other person you believe has a personality disorder and you've read all the books on that\n\nThat's good that you've read the books and you're educating yourself but again you're educating yourself on them and not you\nDo you see where the irony is I'm going to educate\nMyself on them and not not me I'm going to educate myself on that\nIs that the proper way of doing things I don't think so is it the way that many of us will always done it yeah it is\nWe've always thought about the other person besides because the code of tendency we're always thinking about the other person because we're scared to be alone\nThese you know what I'm saying very interesting stuff\nAnd so yes I agree that understanding or a different type of personality disorder or something is very interesting and throwing ends and you can understand but unless they're willing to educate themselves on the situation\nAnd do something about it what does that mean it means that we have\nLooked at ourselves it means that we're trying to educate ourselves on their problem and not look at what we're dealing with\nIts like we'd rather look at all these other issues instead of look at ourselves\nAnd and that to me is a very powerless place to be\nBecause we have to look into ourselves to do a full evaluation as to who we truly\nAre a fool evaluation of what we stand for and where we want to be you determine your life no one else does you determine your life nobody else\nDoes and\nWhen we realize that we understand that it's very powerful but we have to realize that we have to grasp that we have to understand that\nOkay very powerful stuff and I find it very interesting because when we understand that we began to realize that we have some investigation to do over on live\nLike we have to do an arc y'all archaeological dig on ourselves we was the last time you did an archeological dig on herself never\nWell I'm telling you if you're prepared and ready you're going to find some cool stuff you're going to find some stuff maybe you're not all happy that but isn't it better to deal with it now I Want to be able to see it I mean and is it really going to be that bad or we just kind of making the and you know a mountain out of a molehill\n[noise] I think a lot of times we devalue ourselves and we we we feel bad about things that we just need to just deal with and look at it head on\nAnd I think we do that we can really understand that this relationship even though we might consider it toxic is a godsend because we're able to see things clearly 'cause we realize we're back in this thing again we're back in the situation again\nWhy because there's a lesson to be learned you will continue to get lessons over and over again in this universe until you actually learn them until you actually learn them you will get\nThese lessons over and over again because at one point in time you're going to have to learn the lesson at one point in time you're going to have to accept that and understand why this was coming into your life again but if you're not accepting it and not looking at it you're never learning for what you need to learn\nVery powerful stuff very powerful\nAnd it depends on how you deal with it it's only as powerful as how you actually look at it it's only as powerful as what you give the power to\nMe see what I'm saying\n[laughter] and so if you look at this relationship and ... I don't have the judge it as toxic I Need to judge it as a learning tool I don't have to stay\nIn it but I Do have to understand how I got here\nAnd if I can understand how I got here and I can piecemeal together all learn about myself and I'll educate myself so I don't fall into this trap again\nCheck out the website Ashley ... dot com Ashley B.

if I can if not don't worry the vast hundreds of thousands of people vast listening audience\nWho can help and of course about ten doesn't really smart people in the chat rooms eight eighty eight ask\nLeo you may have ah read or heard about the New York times article this week that asserted that ah when the president makes phone calls\nSometimes he does it on an insecure iPhone\nPresident denies this he says\nI ah I only used government phones [laughter] the government and and I remember this came up when Obama took office of two thousand eight and they get a two thousand twelve he had a blackberry in two thousand eight as many of us did and was that it was taken away from the secret service provided him with\nWhich was a pretty junkie\nSecure windows phone shed a lot of modifications according to the times or the president has today has a three cell phones all three iPhones one of two which are modified to make them secure\nUh there's there's no camera one of them is a\n... you know there's no contact there's one of them has ... as\nThat you know there's no contact list there's one of them has ... as a convicted for tweeting only and that kind of thing\nUm so\nThis and this is really reasonable ... as I said the president denies it so I'm not going to weigh in on whether he is or isn't using and secure phone but you might when you read that story said well wait a minute I thought my iPhone was secure and wonder\nHow if if he was using a stock iPhone out of the box how that could be deemed insecure\nI'm\nIn an interview with the wall Street Journal I'm the president when asked what American officials in Turkey I learned about the killing of a democracy Yogi he replied actually I actually said don't give it to me on the phone I don't want it on the phone as good as these phones are supposed to be\n[laughter] uh make most people I think we assume our our iPhones are are secure\nThe way I can only speculate how it would be a hacked but I can tell you how our iPhones that all phones are routinely hacked and we know it it's very common in Washington DC it's with a device colloquially call the sting re\nSting rays are widely used by law enforcement but they can be easily made and easily made by you know spies we know there are many many sting rays in Washington DC\nI'm One of the uh one of the um\nFor digging project bigger small make the call to run one brunch you by common ground ally [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAble to board the tech guy eighty eight eighty eight athletes the phone number eight eighty\nEight two seven five five three six hey it's Chris from Miami hello Chris\nMy friend how are you I Am well how are you on ... it's always a privilege to get on the telephone with you sir thank you so\nYou're you're you're always to kind of gross but thank you\nWell I you know I was you know I have to show on her and it you know it's your radio show and you've always been wonderful and thank you always taken care and everything that well I just wanted to clear one thing I'm already and for full cop so\n[laughter] Chris drinks is special coffee though\nA little cafe copy of the world just say well a animal a Geisha being comes from Panama infrared coffee is you know is is better than roasted so\nI I don't know that some day I Will try some and I will let you know\nThank you [laughter] so um I don't want to keep it because I Know I have just a few minutes uh I always have thirty seconds in my head just to keep mindful show I'm having a lot of issues I have the new iPhone ... s I'm In love I Can't put it down good\nAnd I am the airports and of course but I'm getting a lot of I I think that myself apple tech support\nThe apple stores uh\nWe've all exhausted trying to figure out why I keep getting and she was keep getting distortion using the Arab ...\nUh with the iPhone mostly in not in music not anywhere else just in the call we've done everything from shutting off why fight to we shutting them re storm doing everything and I figured\nMaybe yourself maybe that chat room maybe someone out there might have an idea as to why but a lot of us are facing the same it's\nSo there's two there's two different Bluetooth profiles away ah when you pair Bluetooth you choose a profile the one you used with music they actually several of the most common is called eight to deep Peters also ... he's a fool frequency luscious sounding Kodak\nBut there's also a Bluetooth headset Kodak that is terrible it sounds like a phone call because there was no need to use more bandwidth because well that's how phone calls sounded a and they do sound clip being distorted and and and scratchy\nFor want of a better word um maybe more maybe maybe more so you know I mean that's what you sound like you're on a phone call right now right ah one of the things that's happened though especially um on smartphones these days\nAre many carriers support I at least Eighteen seeds you mobile I'm I I I don't know about the other support we called wife by calling which is all of a sudden the call and you may have made a wife I Columbian stunned to hear you know full frequency phone call like the persons in the room\nOr when that happens I always get very excited about that and somehow those airports I think seemed to convert seemed to handle it so I'm not sure what Apple's doing in terms of profile but normally when you use Bluetooth anything there's different profile depending on how you're using it and when you're using a headset profile\nTo anything there's different profiled depending on how you're using it and when you're using a headset profile you know you wouldn't you wouldn't want to listen to music on the headset profile that sound like a phone call so I'm not\nSure if that's what's going on now there are I'm\nIn and scooter exes mentioning his ... he had said there are headsets support HD high def voice and I would imagine that what they're doing is is flipping over into eight or you know in ... some sort of a a too deep you mode\n... you would think that Apple's air pods would be as good as it can get\nA but I'm not sure\nExactly uh what Apple's doing overall and I haven't I haven't heard that you've seen people complain about this and the forums and so forth\nOh yeah I've done like you know mainly all I always make sure that if I asked a call that chemistry kind let me on today but you know I also noticed something else I Believe or at a five point zero but they're using for pointe shoe I Believe it is yeah that's it\nThat's exactly that's got to be ... um yeah why not what's going on there apple so I let her going out to the company to say why is it your behind the eight ball where we're not using the latest and Bluetooth\nTechnologies airing calm and this is a I think people sometimes think Apple's going to be attacked leader they're not they're tech follower they never want to be the first one to use any technology so it took them forever for instance to use 'em NFC near field communication is well all the other phones are using touch to pay and\nYou were able to tap I'm On a Bluetooth devices to pair and so forth apple only\nStarted doing that a couple of generations ago and even then only allowed at for Apple particular uses apple pay and specifically\nAnd only recently have they started to open up the NFC a PI so their weight behind same thing with wireless charging same thing with a lot of things and so it's not at all surprising the airports would not support Bluetooth five\nApples are funny beach because of course they count the fact that we're we we develop the W one ship just to make sure Bluetooth sounded better and worked better actually they didn't say sounded better I think they only said worked better on the air but\nEverybody thinks there's an air pods second generation just around the corner maybe they'll announce it on Tuesday although I'm not seeing the rumors of that uh I Would I Would really expect the second generation and until then I don't think the airports are the best Bluetooth\nHeadset you can get a Bluetooth to me is really troublesome it's one of the reasons I'm Still angry that apple and Google and others are dropping the headphone Jack really bugs me of the of the four phones in front of me only one has a headphone Jack ... nine really drives me nuts 'cause honestly wired is still better\nYou can always sound better and it's not going to drop out and it's not going to have problems\nYeah I've noticed that yeah so blue just one point the rails on things and well yeah I'm with you but you yeah\nI'm apple apple will adopt which is five later\n[laughter] when we don't need it\n'cause when six comes out which is five ah is fairly new uh ... it was it was uh the phone supported by the way um they have Bluetooth five in the ... everything from the iPhone up so they started that last\nYear um but I guess they didn't you know maybe they're ... came out a little earlier they were in developmental earlier and they didn't feel like well we're going to wait and make sure it's all good it's just apple and I I don't think people\nBy ... you shouldn't buy apple to be on the cutting edge the theory\nThat apple lives by that most apple observers say apple you know actually in bodies is we're gonna take existing technology and make it work better\nThat's where the you know the W one ship in the air power in St Louis because we're not going to check which is five big blue do to make it work better\nUm\nYou you you iPhone is not by any means cutting edge technology\nIt doesn't support five gee for instance uh although no phone yet supports five you the only one I Know it was the Motorola\nAh um as it would be a busy\nPlaying the Motorola Z three which has a doesn't really support five ... but it has a place you could snap on a mode of mud that will give it five gee if that ever comes around\nApple won't do five gee first they won't do any technology first but their theory is but we're going to do it better so you might as well way I Wish apple\nMade an iPhone that was three hundred four hundred dollars as well as always expensive what's cause and that could very with great happiness recommend just don't even consider any other phone just buy an iPhone but honestly they're they're so expensive in fact all of the apple stuff it's so expensive there are better Bluetooth headphones out there\nIn fact I'd love to hear from you which ones do you like a scooter ex Lexus plant products\nUm I think they're better ones that will sound better

saying that he condemns the historic evil of anti Semitism Trump is decided to go ahead do with the Illinois political rally deceiving he's had considered cancelling it because of the synagogue attack\nAnd so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem\nMore than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms\nWhich means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer [noise]\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's kinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing delve into research because they know what's so effective they don't need to get everybody demanding\nA prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a significant number\nTo make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is and let's also underline this point Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs in that off\nAnd New Zealand and that's it every other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice and said no we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained a license to health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an editor this practice because they've seen is just inflating drug prices and steering people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum and we're not that powerful sorry [laughter]\nI Can't change that momentum so we've got to drill back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also\nPeople need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that\nWell there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore the cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers and on all the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person\nAnd I would also encourage people to wait till they were elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try\nTo bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid of these direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected backing to Laurie useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son what ... what are watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nBest thing you said was that [laughter] was gosh I Can't get past you have a new explained that to your side anyway the best\nThing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money go into the ads and so don't mind them change your mind don't let those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact don't even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nWith David Lazarus from Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son when he Diaz says family radio\nWell I Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances [laughter]\nBut [laughter] [laughter] okay\nCorey with us on the car coward show whoa Corey how you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you\nGreat thank you [noise] Corey you've got something that happened in your life it's not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately a those after my wife says uh my wife's dad passed away\nWell I'm very sorry about her loss\nThank you\nSo how can I be of service in this situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our auto insurance 'cause we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while the kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage\nSo we're going to be adding a six sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh\nOh I just add your wallet just take that not even stab your wallet a lot\nYou know 'cause that's what happens when you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes you know we're lucky enough so that we didn't have to buy a car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny of the cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that my wife but that was the one of the first thought so had along with um raising our deductibles\nYou know I'm a ... fan and raising the doctor most okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to okay but that helps\nAnd you were five hundred now so\nYeah it's a raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred or claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway no because the insurer will just eat up on premiums so you want to avoid that and then how old are your vehicles\nSo our oldest vehicle as a ... for\nYou only want to have liability on that one\nYeah but that's okay that's what I was thinking to the other two are neuro we have a two thousand Fifteen in the car we just got his uh two thousand and fourteen so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the yo for if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the more but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most time for sure\nSure you in this case there may be an advantage and talking with an independent agent\nOkay you know something people really don't do any more but there are agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies and they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older it was a lot of young people I have no interest in becoming\nMost of them are older\nBecause a lot of young people have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations I'd done with new drivers were teenagers what's gonna be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nSometimes depending on the state and how rates tend to be set in the state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner that vehicle so if they are and being on a separate policy and then in other places it may be better for him to only be named an additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to him\nPerfect that's where the independent agent become so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some what are known as direct writer companies are ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and so the agent will not be able to quote those but don't have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some phone number is already from friends that have gone down that path but it seems like it'd be very helpful to have some specific a self us\nAnd you got to make sure they're not what's called a captive agent for example State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what are known as captives they only write for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nRight sort of independent agent okay\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nAn

great thanks how are you are too\nYes I Am thank you\nSo you've got a question for me that how you doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer the question\nThey may help in the long run I was just curious about the question concerns about taking Social Security is a sixty two\nAnd possibly investing that whole mail as opposed to waiting for the higher amount a later age I feel like the right of investment you probably would be\nBetter off than waiting tools a sixty six and four months so it seems like a whole chunk of change and the government and all and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nStunner is at what investments earn today what savings aren't today it is nearly impossible for someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in\nWhat the computer to advantage is to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur your cost of living adjustment of space for the rest of your life on a higher initial amount\nSo and also there's no tax you are going to do\nOr waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to laying right now at age sixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money\nIs when you take it and in my case you know at age I'm going to take it\nToo late\nAge Seventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent products me extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to ah hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it\nSo you gave the ah you gave the analogy of sixty two and your retirement age would you say sixty six years four months is that what she said\nYes so if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nI plan on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I'm Still feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's going to stop me soon so\nProbably a good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me to eleven years to regain the money that I let go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but the big problem with um retirement years his later and retirement\nWhen we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work we may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefits now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother\nIn January my oldest brother will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us know ever and he will be at that time Seventy two\nSo you know that all we are not a genetically disposed to live long as guys in my family so it can you imagine I'm underweight delayed Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nThe mother that's over Ninety and she's still chicken so I\nWill say in your case there is a direct advantage to waning because what you really concerned about his way down the road so I
