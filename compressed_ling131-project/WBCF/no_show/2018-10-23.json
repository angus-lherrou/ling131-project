people\nYou know I'm a I'm a conservative so I I really want it to stay neutral along along this whole matter just protecting schools yeah but if the political uh and and now I'm at a political ah I'm getting drawn to our side because I just want the school safe and our teacher say right\nNow I'm with you it's a Republican he's done a ton to try to fix it tech fixes what you should use her bronze winter I'm watching the debate last night and you were mentioned by round as soon as the former congressman the Republican running for governor\nI'm you've met with him extensively he wants to fix it he even said your name and he said your daughter's name and he said fix it\nHas the Andrew Gillum or his campaign reached out to you or anybody else other than those who are politicizing this has he wanted to work with you to fix it\nNo it hasn't been any Democrat that are reached out to me to try and fix it because\nThey're only agenda is gun grabbing it's not the howling in heart and the schools how we're gonna make entry points how we get a mental illness it's all about grabbing guns and it's just a distraction of what we can get done or if they work together but evidently we can't work together\nSo I Want school say ... and that that's my attend the Joe ...\nDemocrat who's challenging a round of suits as soon as the Republican or for governor the governor's office is going to be open to manage I'm going to be because Rick Scott who's running for for Senate\nGillum last night didn't sound to me you do look to me like he was willing to say I will removes got Israel if I win\nScott Israel can all screwed up it was it was a complete mess with the sheriff in Broward County and then he went on CNN and talked about how amazing his response was this guy has to go when I talked to the same as last week and you know there's a he said yeah I Would have to review with him and possibly make a change their\n... what would give them do as far as you know you live there to to change\nUm the safety aspect the dangers that our kids face in school\nI'm Glad you asked me that show because I listened a last night in that debate and he had both a\nRunning last night about about school safety and when it\n... is about school safety in Parkland he knew the issues he brought up superintendent once he brought up the promise program he brought up the sheriff he brought up the you know those leniency policies that led up to ... or ... ... and so he knows\nAbout what happened in Parkland get all he did all he did was ask him a while he was mentioned uh the n._r._a. right you know\nThey kept on saying that the Centers for some reason and we used to see you find that you've been saying this was somehow bought and paid for by the honorary he didn't answer the direct question whatsoever on what it is he's going to do to make schools safer and in fact he he he didn't really comment much on the legislation that ... got it done\nExactly Joe so that that's why I reach out at an even had any democratic listeners out there I urge you you want your school said okay and if you want to change\nOh just vote guardian line in this race it's so important for the state of Florida that that we had a governor that that's going to make a difference that don't look at what happened and what went wrong and try and fix things not a guy that's just going to be like every other politician that comes to Parkland\nAnd wants to just blame guns if it was just a gun I I Would agree with them but I Know otherwise Joe I don't know the entity that sale\nAnd I know so why if you're a Democrat don't just vote on the line right here and brown this time or wherever you are Florida\nI'm I'm Talking to every Democrat out there looking at that what what ... says his answer was last night he knows what happened in Parkland and and get on this just quick to point the finger at the end All right\nYou know I think that it's a it's a it's a selling point because again be survivors Rubin so incredibly political since February that's all they talked about is the ... the ... he was embarrassed to read in ... to make them go and get it being a rated Mitt can kill anybody I mean the n._r._a. and I've never kill anybody don't ever plan to unless of course they have to defend my family my stuff\nOn it because the inner ear exist that doesn't mean that is why we have school shootings batch ridiculous in fact\nUm when you were watching it last night well let me ask you this because a lot of people watching and I do have Democrats in watching listen but they only watch or listen to see if they can't find something instead of going to attack having said that\nWhen you got to get it was wrong to say that this did anybody disguise you straight up his you and I are ... you know screw year this was a direct question did they say we need your help to help him win or did they say Ron is really concerned about school safety what did they say\nOh I'll be the first time I met Ron was at a Republican dinner and he didn't know I was there an Enron started talking about accountability\nAt a local level are holding fishes officials accountable to hand holy accountable so that really interesting because since my daughter's death Joe no one's been held accountable except that one in ... right you know all the people that dropped the ball do their job\nThere is no remorse in Broward County it's business as usual so I listen to it she didn't know I was in the audience that night and he spoke things that really makes sense to me right so we got\nTogether in DC when I was on a trip and we spoke about accountability with the FBI and he wanted to introduce me to them\nWell just about accountability with the FBI and he wanted to introduce me to the people in the FBI to get a fair or their questions answered why all those leads that that would have said my daughter\nTo what really what it was about solving the problem\nYes it was nothing about his race\nPatch she that's amazing to me because Gillum you're right only ... is going negative and we're going to re going negative because you know the interesting things around as soon as would be a good candidate I think so too um but but he doesn't say anything about fixing anything and you're looking at a garbage running one of the most dangerous cities in in the state if not the country when it comes to the murder rate per capita\nYou can I was listening to degrade each other for ended up in Polk County a great guy and he asked that was in he said the crime rate in Tallahassee is thirty four percent higher\nThan the crime rate in Chicago wow that\nCome on man and got a guy up there who who is\nThe the things that he said last night first of all look what he was running against Trump and not just do this and I as a guy who lived in Florida for Twenty one years of my life my mother still lives in my my ... my sisters still live there I have a great connection to Florida I don't want to see a guy who wants to raise everybody's taxes\nWho who is running a city horribly he's city is under investigation one of his closest friends is under investigation I mean it doesn't make any sense to me as I was watching it last night he was very well schooled on what to say in how to say it memorized them pretty snappy lines\nBut man it seemed to be about negative negative negative whereas I bought the seat was saying here's what I Want to do for the state and here's what we have to do together\nSure how can a governor alert federally on a federal level\nIf they did was trash or president do for that and that whole debate you know the thing that we need federal funding for our mentioned that red tide Enron and wants to get edited and he's going to work at a federal level what\nHow scale I'm going to work just anything in this state federally when he he's looking to impeach up a great president you know\nIt doesn't make a lot of sense of ... republic you lost his daughter metal in February and I must be high school I'm a idiot use that website Philip running what is it Americans per class dot org\nYeah ... ... and you know Joey at Parkland or about a week ago yeah a friendly or Nancy Pelosi games\nWhile wow what a follow up at is you know it's kind of sick cutting coupons or parading these idiots through that school as if somehow ... that's going to solve the problem means he blows used do nothing to solve it Andrew Gillum has done nothing to solving schedule still has a job it kinda makes me sick maybe\nYeah so I came here talking about background checks or to make more background checks you know what I make it harder to do\nBackground check the background check when they're shown and even on this idiot because of the promise program she's not smart when it comes to what she's talking about but she knows that the left wing you know lemmings will just buy it back to the problem right\nThere is no background exactly right it's a problem but she's just a a you know looking at an agenda of guns at ground check because that's what she's going to come in all is not the real issues and that but the unrest and so he can never have a background\nAndy we always appreciate my friend which started getting very soon\nGeorgia buddy back after\nThis new Joe packed shows decorator\n\n\n\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well

dollars reward for ... and up to five million dollars reward for colleague I'll buy tower the where did that come from top\nWell John this is a good example of what we talk about talk about these are kind of veterans who ... who can just sort of keep operating for many many years and stay in the game despite being relentlessly hunted by the U.S are allies because ... and how it up a coffee are both I'll ... veterans from\nTraining camps pre nine eleven in Afghanistan so these are both these guys attended offer which was okay this primary training facility in pre nine eleven Afghanistan\nAnd so their Journey Through jihad starts all the way back then and ... actually was again a fight very early on by al ... as the guy who should be groomed for a leadership position he somebody who they they very early on thought you know sort of had that potential and lo and behold today these are two of the most senior guys\nIn Yemen they've now leading okay there may be paid so now you know a lot of times you hear people talk about ... pie that's OK and rape and it's as if it's an affiliate of al ...\nA lot of times you hear people talk about ... pie that's OK as rain but it's as if it's an affiliate of al ... well what we've said all along has no it's not really an affiliate look either it's just all kinda\nBecause guys like this are groomed all kind of veterans who have been putting these positions Toledo kinda globally so they probably are ... they probably play a role in actually all kinds of global management team making decisions around the globe now\nA creepy of course came to fame because of the um attacks that they tried to plant against the United states\nGoing Christmas Day two thousand nine or when you had the this underwear bomber on Detroit bound plane and you've had a series of other mostly failed plots\nSome inspired like dollar sign at Fort Hood ah which was sort of has some sort of inspirational connection minimum take a pay for the most part ... piece plots against the u._s. has failed however they have taken advantage of the war in Yemen this multi sided conflict and they've expanded their base\nInside Yemen and according to a un report that came out this last summer they now have somewhere between six and seven thousand fighters in Yemen Andre ... command so these two guys who um the u._s. ... releases rewards for increased the reward for one of them and actually released a new or work for the other one\nUm these are guys who likely have thousands of fighters on under their command\nOf the consistent nature of your reporting over the years suggest that title looks upon its personnel\nAs interchangeable with other personnel do they move them around in theaters to learn networking Tom do they have a a a chart a personnel chart that says let's training here let's trade him there or is it hit or miss well\nYou know we don't know exactly what their personnel policies are we can only track these guys and show when they pop up somewhere and say that there's probably some thought behind doing that and what we've seen is not only traffic from Afghanistan Yemen and back through the years of course going only back to the Nineteen nineties\nBut then you see guys go from Yemen to other places so we've track them to the Sinai we tracked him to Syria and Italy province attract in the north Africa and Libya and you see these guys go out of the pie and they serve leadership roles in other parts of the kind of work elsewhere\nSo looks to us like this a creepy serves not only is part of the senior management structure within al ... the top leaders but they have guys are they groomed go elsewhere to sort of continue on with that role elsewhere\nAnd the fact that they move them around is that a promotion can we tell do they have levels of trust and command authority a ... would be a a comparable to a colonel or general can we think of them that way\nSo John it's amazing you're asking this question because\nThere's not been any work that we can detect to actually map out what their human ... organization looks like in years and there's never at least publicly US government is not tried to even explain what the management structure of all kind of looks like and yet when you go through their primary source\nStatements and literature you go through other pieces here and there you can point out and show that they do have a man and restructure that's in place despite the relentless post nine eleven war has been waged on them\nThey still have the management structure in place to this day and its opaque they don't they don't put on or turn on line to explain it to everybody but you can pick up details here and there for example you know I mean I was out here of course the emir of okay well you know he has at least two deputy mirrors by the way who according to the UN or in Iran and helping and lead the charge for all kinds of globally from Iran\nBut then you have guys like this in Yemen who are fighting the Iranians his wife gets all ... complex\nWho are also probably part of your head of senior management team you start putting this all together you can see there is a a sort of a human organization they're from top to bottom and yet there's been very little done publicly by the U.S government to explain to since nine eleven members an island of ... report gave a summary of sort of a basic summary of the commission structure\nThat have these different entities within all kind of worked or to guide the organization internationally we haven't seen updated version of that I can that I can point to any way since two thousand four so that tells you so how how out of date or assessments are is\nYour measure of al ... is it showing cohesion ... is there some change in its confidence level can you tell them\nWell you know it's interesting last week General Dunford had a very interesting comment this is the type of thing that should be everybody's ears perk up when they hear this\nHe says that they've got new indications are new evidence intelligence that al ... is\nAble to communicate more readily and manage more readily across the globe it's sort of infrastructure in place\nThis is like this is sort of a key tell because there's been a lot of what we call disconnect the dots announces through the years to try and explain away all ... to try and say that has there is no cohesion there is no global network and play and here's yet another comment however from U.S officials saying no there actually is\nSo some cohesion here and there is there is some coordination across international boundaries we think that that degree of coordination equation is actually a lot more than even what some people have said but it's it's interesting to hear General Dunford a very senior level expressed that publicly chosen something got them some assessment God told them that said oh look out\nGeneral Dunford is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of four star a marine general and he leads the effort to defeat the gal ... so when he comments as Tom says look out Tom just one of the foundation for the defense of democracy this\nNational security report brought to you

digital experience I'm John batch\nRally Republican ... Fox News presidents on the Houston taxes to support Senator Ted Cruz\nIs just seen as the people of taxes are going to re elect a man who is become a really good friend of mine you know we had a little difficult [noise]\nActually if you remember the beginning it\nWas a love Suzanne president simpler bitter rivals in the presidential race with the president nickname include blind hand president mocking Democrats would their predictions in the mid term\nMember about a month ago right they were talking about this new senator\nCruz is up on his Democratic opponent ... run by seven points in the latest poll or President Obama meanwhile sent part of today in his Atlanta campaigning for Democrats thousands of migrants from Central America and continue to make their way to the southern border of the last even asked president some threatened to pull funding to those countries\nHow these defense ministers and our secretary of defense\nThing called these demonstrations by the navy part\nI think that there'll be some huffing and puffing on the part of ... at first because they won't let this go\nBut uh you know within a month or two maybe several months and things will be back to normal the reason is when the United states shows strain the Chinese back off um and so there's going to be a little bit less huffing and puffing than you'd think\nYou know so far China's been quiet about this transit or I'm waiting in the next several hours to see what Beijing says and we'll get a really good hint of where they're going because if we get a relatively mild statement that means things will settle down if\nThey actually are belligerent um you know I trust that the Trump Administration will meet word for word and that's something that we need to do right now to show Beijing that we do have the resolve\nSaturday Gordon is ending on the wording the communication as you mentioned but we're all skin the Chinese regime attack the United states has interests in a tit for tat sort of way in a in a new in the streets or anywhere else\nThey can do that anywhere on planet earth any place in space you know the euro versus not off limits um and so you know we're going to see a broad base challenge um and they will do that um see jumping has nowhere to back down he owns this controversy with the United states\nIf he is seen to cave in um he's very well may not be living so um you know this is going to go on for quite some time that is um but seemed to the gym paying is whether he's an aberration or whether he is the ... result of Chinese communism\nWe've got him for a little while and we've got to make sure that he understands that he cannot get what he wants\nThe Senate these chop cotton and six point five percent that's the official number GDP said to be the slowest in the decades since the great recession of two thousand two thousand nine whatever the real number is there is a contraction of the growth in China it depends upon\nThat means unemployment does Xi Jinping does the standing committee do they have a response to this\nWell there are only response John is to do what they've been doing in the last several months which is to stop their de leveraging campaign pile on the debt\nAnd hope that they can grow their way out of this which of course they can't because even if you believe their official GDP number of six point five percent growth and and you shouldn't but even if you were to believe it they're incurring one and a half times as much as they're creating nominal gross domestic product\nThat's completely hum a losing proposition for the June paying it just a question of how long he can hold on he can hold on a long time but he's making the inevitable crisis bigger so they don't have any real solution the real solution of course would be to reform but see jumping doesn't want to do that\nSo he's just going to take the country off the cliff with him\nThat he's going to Gordon how about the capital of slows you talked about before yeah\nUm well there hasn't been very much in the way of capital outflow since September or so of two thousand six team because the capital controls right now or Conan the ones that are announced and the ones that they are effectively enforcing which are unannounced\nBut I think we're going to start to see more money come out because there's a real change in the Senate and China it's gotten quite dark um\nAnd you can see that of course with the falls in the stock market and in the currency\nThe only reason why there was a rebound um today was in China\nWhich was actually quite a strong rebound and the Shanghai composite wasn't because the Chinese authorities were making these statements about how great the stock market was\nAnd they probably were also buying as well so you know and under those circumstances it's no longer a market um but you started to see I think a real pessimism because people are understanding the consequences not only of slow growth but also the challenge ... siege and paying as opposed to the United states\nAnd the American response the thing that's different Thaddeus is the American response\nDoes the renminbi go to seventh or did they touched that that that live wire\nYou know I think so John you know if you'd asked me two or three weeks ago I would've said no and I probably would be wrong um because I think that they're starting to believe that they cannot indefinitely defend the currency I thought that they were defending six nine um but you know they went through six nine so I think I was wrong on that\nAnd you know of course the only time will tell but I think that they eventually after all that what they should do John is a big one time devaluation shocked the markets punish all the speculators but they're not smart enough to do that\nAt one time devaluation ... what would that look like\nDo you know going to eight or eight and a half to the U.S dollar um from six point nine three which is where they are now and then that really shocks everybody and it stops the slow erosion when you have slow erosion you have the central bank\nI'm starting to spend foreign exchange reserves to no good and and that's what we saw last month you know twenty two point seven billion dollars a decline in their foreign exchange reserves\nUm and it didn't really do any good John So I think they need a one time big ... I think most analysts would recommend that but the gym paying is not willing to do it because that that admission that his policies haven't worked he can't make it an invasion of that sort\nGordon Chang the Daily Beast that he's McCotter W.

tweets\nThese last days certainly the president of the United states has made it very clear that he wants to make this he is making this a partisan issue saying the Democrats want this the Democrats are behind this and other remarks pointing to the Democrats\nHe's also the president and his aides at the White House are saying that they are unknown middle Easterners and the character\nJohn I Begin with you list care of that looks like a problem for the Democrats and I want to look at the Senate races\nArizona which is said to be close Texas not close but certainly better Iraq as a premier candidates for the Democrats Montana close Nevada close Missouri I Can't tell Tennessee I Can't tell but certainly leaning Republican\nDoes the caravan change any of those states for the Senate and does it change the house seats that are at risk in those states job\nWell it's an awful visual because I'm Democrats are almost paralyzed from commenting on this because you know there's a sea of brown faces and even black faces in the care of him and to go criticize it doesn't say that we'd have to protect our sovereignty is too risky politically incorrect messed\nUp Trump and the Republicans I can guarantee you're going to have commercials for the last few days with the campaign which will future quotes from all the leading Democrat starting with Kamala Harris from California enlisted before and saying we have to abolish ice the immigration service and then there will be the pictures of the hordes climbing\nA I sat next to someone at dinner who's from Hungary very knowledgeable of Hungarian politics during the migrant crisis of twenty Fifteen\nHungry was able to stuff Ninety nine percent of its immigration problems with the fence\nA and he said I Believe that this could do to the Democrats this fall with the migrant issue to Angela Merkel which is painter as powerless and unwilling to defend the sovereignty of her country\nDavid Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said earlier this month we ever arrested almost one hundred people highly linked to terrorist groups specifically ISIS I don't know the facts in Guatemala\nThis group specifically ISIS I don't know the facts in Guatemala but the suggestion is that the White House is linking this to ISIS a does this change the face of the election in the Senate as you measure it David\nI don't think so but that's only because I think the Senate has already in a really good spot for Republicans now I I Do think it's possible this message could have an impact in Arizona and Nevada um most of all possibly Montana Texas a secure I think Tennessee isn't a good spot\nUm and I think just Republicans in the Senate in general are are in good shape and they're only competitive house each really that could be swayed either way is among the states in Nevada but I Do think it's smart messaging by the president a look at your base another reason to turn out gives them another reason\nTo get ginned up about the opposition party and in mid term when you hold the White House the hold all balance of power what you want to do is try and convince your voters little they don't show up bad things are going to happen and that's really easy to do\nWhen you have no power as bad things from your point of view are already happening\nSo your show up to vote to put a stop to them and that's the president's doing with this message of the you know the one counter here\nIs ... is Democrats are not playing ball they're not engaging hears a Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement after that Trump tweet where he said Chuck and Nancy call me we can\nTalk border security and they just turned it around to health care which is where they want they used to be a but but the other thing\nThat I give Democrats have going for them in this regard as President Trump\nIs in control of national security and he has his disposal the power\nTo stop migrants at the border and so it's not a situation I think this would be more potent like national security wasn't twenty fourteen when Senate Republicans and in fact House Republicans were able to run against President Obama's\nHandling of ISIS when he referred to them as the JV swan and diminished the danger that they posed in the middle east into American national security in general this is a case where\nA President Trump was warning of this while I think it's a good election year message down the stretch ultimately he's in charge which means he can implement policy to stop this and that's if Democrats really getting the English and they can say look\nYeah President Trump has the power to deal with this we're not standing in his way\nSaturdays don't they have some type of obligation at least in terms of messaging on this I mean\nI don't know who's behind this march I just see a bunch of people coming to the United states for a long time for the mid term don't the Democrats at least have to say something on this will be the 'cause Jon talked about a David what can they say about that David\nI I don't really think they have to say anything about this and in fact I think at the same way I think it's more for the president push this from a political standpoint I think the best thing Democrats could do is say nothing\nYou don't anger your base by by by trying to outflank trip on the right and you don't play Trump's game by looking weak and looking as though you hope that everybody shows up and and and gets into the country\nSay nothing the most I Would say if I were a democratic candidate is it I was a I clearly for border security and Mrs President Trump's job deal with this because he's the president\nAnd and that's what I think they should this John\nI think that's a good strategy accept that there's some of the leading Democrats who earlier earlier said this time to abolish ice so if they remain silent\n'em and they don't repudiate their previous position or they tried to model it I think that just gives turns the debate away from health care which is what the Democrats wanted it to be turns of immigration\nWhich is a mixed issue for Trump but not in the districts are Republicans after hold on that is a base turnout model\nKen we agree John that this is a this is about as hot as it gets as we watch these videos so we don't know what's going to happen the next two weeks but they're marching marching

[laughter]\nI Know that my friends did because they all took the obligatory selfies with the sticker that said I voted for the doors have so long the oath and and what are we going to see what this mid term elections I can tell you my friends\nIn a couple of different places said they thought it was brisk and this early voting was bigger than they had ever seen you know it's always my hope here on America Tonight and I've been doing this show we're celebrating ten years that we would see a ton of people vote either early voting absentee or on\nElection day because I think it's the most powerful thing you can do if you want to wind complain\nAnd freak out about what's happening in America or applaud that your candidate got elected well go invoke\nGet involved in starts locally and then it goes from their here's where the president had to say about the midterms in the Democratic platform\nAbout the midterms in the Democratic platform\nWhich means\nMassive tax cuts there again

congressman from Ohio with TOP Media news\nBob so you might have heard when I said that um my ... told me and and honestly it was about a dozen people now where they could vote early and they did they saw that a lot of people were out so maybe there's some hope that people are either upset happy\nWhatever it is a or have a certain candidate in mind that they're going out there in voting I think it may be a good sign because we traditionally haven't seen that right\nThat's right Kate and I think a part of the excitement of the terms cover all in all the things that have happened ah you know the big um merry go round up a bit formation maybe has stirred up so that people will be out\nA rising new voting a little bit early this year\nYeah and it's interesting so when you were in Congress and you talked about this getting elected when it was like the process you know when you get down to the nitty gritty does this time of year so like if you're if you're a dinner\n... ... who are being a ...\nYear Ted Cruz in there and cruises the incumbent and you're pushing for that Senate seat or you basically not sleeping at all\n[noise] oh you are I mean is ... you know just you asking me this question brings back twenty four years' worth a\nMonth before and the campaigns and you're waiting for the bomb to draw up and you've got to be out there uh I I Know seriously of samples of friends of mine who ran and about two weeks before\nThey work but not that much in one of them lost by four votes on one of them lost by one vote so [noise] you know you you hear the stories but you're always out there right this is to\nJust get out and you can go time if you're really serious about your race absolutely\nSo as we motor through this here in America tonight with me Kate to lean celebrating ten years and before that I ... I spent a week but the border patrol and I saw what was happening with the people it was sad was happening for the innocent people and it was sickening the other things that were going on like these crazy rate trees\nBecause of the predators and how they went after\nUm some of the people they were supposedly aiding and getting across the border so anyway here's where we are now the Washington Post CNN the Associated Press and other outlets covering this journey um\nAre saying that you know now you know there there was a smaller care caravan before reach the U.S border earlier in the year and it just kind of fell apart\nSo there were people that crossed the Guatemalan border into southern Mexico this weekend\nAnd they say 'cause there's reporters there in the middle of this that maybe they're estimating but maybe it's you know five thousand people or so and they say a lot of the people are fleeing poverty organized violence in their home countries all of that and they're traveling to gather\nAs they cross some of these areas because of the drug cartels and the gangs and they want asylum at the border or they're trying to cross into the United states illegally and it's just math my migration especially pouring out of Central America so\nIs it five thousand seven thousand I mean whatever the numbers are this is something I think we're probably going to see happen more and more and here's what the president cautioned against when you talk about ah this caravan and the characters that could be mixed in [noise]\nSo of course he's getting on a helicopter but MS Thirteen is he saying you're gonna find everything are defined MS Thirteen et cetera in the middle\nOf this and now what it's become is whack a mole and they're trying to identify who could be in the middle of this is there's somebody trying to come through that could carry some bomb or do something at the border or just\nAssimilate and get into the to the country 'cause we've heard those stories before it of course we know that it's um [noise]\nBut it certainly has happened and speaking of weaponry this is certainly a huge story\nWhen we talk about the um Russians and the nukes and treaties of the past and expectations of where they're headed and why\nAsked and expectations of\nWhere they're headed and why they're not working and this is interesting because it was such a big piece of so many presidents\n\nSome things that um [noise] as a kid this is something that I Know that I had in social studies or whatever\nHistory where we would talk about reduction of nukes and what was happening on the other side and all that kinda stuff so we will jump into that but we're still in the middle\n\nAnd what the thoughts are on the caravan and as an evil to push the people out how do we streamline this what are we did\n\nAnd dancing around all the same issues let's go to John in Seattle Hi John\nI knew it [noise] yeah I think this country's been pretty ... called the year's low mhm I hear you I got ya oh okay okay I'm\nI'm there has to be a point where [noise]\nYou know we we can't just taken more and more people I'm sure it should mean something you know a lot of people in this country are given a lot to uh [noise] you know the stuff that's gone all over the world and make life better for a lot of people do a lot of different places and\nI think there's a point we're a country ask are and it's a character who they are what they are like I said I Do think we've been very generous oh through the years but\nYou know what I was born there was thirty three billion people on the planet now there's one billion people on the planet [laughter] this is just there's a lot of rising expectations all over the planet and still are cold you know there's just so many resources on so many\nWays to develop from the quality of life but [noise] you know I mean it's tough times you know these people are common was\nYou know pretty bad conditions but I mean there is a poet or citizenship to\nBe important as much as trying to leave the people suffering oh what do you say\n\nJohn I think it's a good point thank you for the call it where I think is you're right we've come to that critical point again and why are we here John where here because of the reasons I said we have laws on the books they were completely\n\nSo GW tried to on it and there was massive up\n\nAnd and this was a guy spoke fluent Spanish and had certainly a decent relationship\n\nAnd it never we can never get this right we never could get it right I again I think is because people would be infuriated than awful things started to happen and as you say then we would see that there wasn't talked about a lot but\n\nDrain so the taxes will go up in parts of Southern California than we would find drug runners and tunnels you know the other evil side of it the gangs the the um\nHorrible side of the loose border I caught the loose border because when I was with the border patrol\n... there was the easy part of getting people when they crossed\nInto El Paso from water as\nBut then there were this bars places that were out in the middle of the desert where it was easier to get by but then so often they would find people that were murder that just be dead bodies they couldn't even identify them\n... and some horrific things have happened to innocent people on that side as well so\nWe'll we cut off the eight I mean this was the president saying it's going to begin to cut off aid to countries that are in any way associated with the caravan so what does that mean then they stopped the people from going because right now there's so much corruption and places like Guatemala and El Salvador\nThey don't care or they were just people ... are sneaking out and whatever they're jumping on the trains doing whatever they can in this case it's a walk but if they're not going to get money that I think they're going to do something about it but what does that look like what what form in other words\nDoes that take a hen I'm I'll be curious to see honestly what it what happens what kind of pressure is put to put on those governments and\nWhat they how they end up responding to to their people I don't want to make sure he squeezes and because I talked about the you know talked about things getting in things\nWe used to worry so much about nukes that was all about you reduce yours will reduce SARS you take a few way we'll take a few I can they reach us can they not reach us I mean how many times was that discussion going on so the president is withdrawing from the intermediate\nRange nuclear forces treaty I talked about this on our show the other day and just to continue the conversation I had a conversation with somebody today and they thought it was good to push the issue because they said listen is much different than we are talking about\nYou know and applauding President Reagan and what he did with\nGorbachev and that I N F treaty in eighty seven

insanity we just cannot support this we just cannot support the amount of people and we certainly can't\nUm stop everyone at the border because of the size that it's growing too whether it's five thousand seven thousand or whatever it is it's a mess that's for sure I think the president saying withholding money will make a big difference hopefully the innocence won't get caught up in the middle of this although I\nThink they unfortunately will well yeah we were just talking about that and it you think of Honduras and etcetera and there are some horrible I mean I Can't even describe the conditions that I've been told that that are happening and some of these\nIn some of these countries remember we took the show to Ecuador and when I was there I had to have 'em guard with me the whole time and my brother was scared to death I he's like this manly man and he never worries about anything they remember him saying to me proof of life and they'll think of you and they'll look at you as a talk show host and\nData and I actually 'cause I was in some poor depressed areas and we brought that back to you how sad it was but in these cases yeah I mean\nIt's true it's gotten that much worse so we are at that point because nothing was done before now we're at that critical mass point of\nOkay so I'm really what are the sizes but how do you make sure you don't have the worst of the worst in the crowd how do you ... the the years\nUm is it an exaggerated amount of people that are strongly that border is it bigger than what's being said I mean we're going back into the numbers game again and I can remember\nGosh at the beginning of America Tonight when that was the conversation how many people were in the country illegally how many how many how I Would just became like\nThis almost like an episode of our we can count how many and there's you know it's not a turnstile and that's the idea because we have no idea what the count is we don't we have no idea\nAnd the

see that they were talking about that the cups break pretty easily\nAnd that it's irresponsible and that they're spending that much on the coffee cups so somebody needs to make coffee cup that doesn't break or handles and break as easily so we don't have to spend thousands of dollars to\nReplace it [laughter] I guess um and this and seriously this is a true story\nBuying replacing special mugs because they can re heat liquids aboard these air fueling tankers and flight and then that's what the whole thing is so they\nThey have to figure it out and replace them so they purchase a bunch of

though frankly Pam their earnings report hasn't been that bad\nTo sort of tease out what we're seeing right now in the markets it's bringing tables and ... the editor columnist and blogger at ... am life go on the Bloomberg so let's just start with the market action right now the NASDAQ leading declined lower two point four percent declined so far I'd say it's fluctuated a little bit but the loss of seemed to be deepening what's driving this right now\nWell as much as anything people are realizing that some of the concerns that had been really around all year whether you're talking about higher commodity prices you know higher labor costs higher transportation costs the effects of towers\nAre really coming home to roost for companies and it it's an issue in terms of their ability to sustain earnings growth into the fourth quarter and beyond\nAs the effects of last year's tax cuts kind of wear off you know bear in mind\nYou look at the absentee five hundred at twenty four percent earnings growth in the first and second quarter is you'll probably get close to that for the third quarter by the time you get all the results in\nWith the you know the question is what happens after that and to what extent does profit growth slowed down you know the kinds of issues that investors happy to work for\nUnderstood days but what are we seeing seeing specifically that gives rise to those worries right now I mean in the earnings in anything in particular that's going on\nBut you got caterpillar talking about how higher costs for freight and materials partly because of the towers are going to hurt results down the line going into next year you have three am\nCutting its annual earnings forecast the third time this year and there was a company has certainly affected by those kinds of issues so you know they're they're out there they're having an effect and you're really seeing investors reacting to them in a big way here\nWell Dave ... just a little bit more on a divergence in the marketplace because United Technologies posting results and stocks moving the other way people are buying it so it's not as if it's just a monolithic market\nOh absolutely not him I mean what's interesting is you've had five companies and the Dow Jones industrial average report today I mentioned two of them already caterpillar and three and the other three are higher United Technologies up one point seven percent were wrong\nUp two point six percent and McDonald's with the biggest gain and and that group and one of the biggest the absentee by a hundred overall up five and a half percent\nAnd that came through even though they're USA store sales so you're talking locations\nUh open more than a year now just to touch the growth didn't quite measure up to the average estimate nonetheless that earnings median projections are also revenue and that was enough to send the stock up on a day when a whole lot of other shares appalling\nI guess the I mean it but the reason why I started with the NASDAQ and that is leading the declines Amazon shares down at three point seven percent apple shares that more than two percent what's driving that well it may be just simply\nA case that these stocks have done really well on the way up so you have a down day and they they disproportionately get ... on the way down\nI mean because those specific examples it's not like you can point to news that's out there\nI mean if you were talking about let's say chip stocks\nI mean and chip equipment stocks that might be a different story we're seeing and was backing away from some of those uh specifically you had already is estimates on video which does graphics chips are folks did on ... on gaming machines or they were caught at the at least the the students were cut UPS they're concerned about how it's going to take\nMore of their leaders gaming ship the technology to really going to be rolled out there so that stocks down about five percent applied materials are among the trip equipment makers down three point seven percent that's going on a kind of backing away and say\nWell it looks like companies really aren't gonna spend quite so much on their own networks rowing cloud computing which involves the Internet's the put them all together\nAnd you can understand why these why some of the technology stocks are falling now others it's more just do you call them high beta when the market far they fall more\nWhen you want to know where there is buying there's buying all across the bomb and like you say go treasuries the thirty year is trading at three point three to ... percent it is up\nMore than a full point it is up one and six thirty seconds taking a look at the ten year it trades at eleven of well three point eleven and a two year trade to to eighty five so a lot of buy in the treasury market\nToday yields are dropping the most since may and Dave this is really interesting 'cause this kind of counter is what we saw in the past few weeks that people are wringing their hands saying you've never getting sell offs in the ... and and equity markets we're not seeing rallies\nIn the bond market which you normally see so it doesn't sort of act as this balance and the sixty forty way that people have been counting on today this shouldn't come as a relief\nWell that's one day I mean\nAnd you do have to look through the stock market to and see that\nThe more defensive areas you're talking about the kinds of shares at relatively high dividends they're holding up better than the rest\nOf the U.S in the five hundred utilities index for example do change that real estate health care a consumer staples food beverage tobacco all relatively high a dividends and you know they're they're not getting hit as hard as some of the other groups out there so you know kinda fits in the bond theme was well\nI just want to add that we're looking at oil and I'm looking at oil prices declined two and a half percent right now west Texas intermediate sixty seven and a half dollars for a barrel and also looking at goal going the other way gold is higher by one and a quarter percent trades at twelve hundred and thirty seven

political\nRisks a or the political benefits to the president for taking these positions [noise]\nWell it's very clear ... the over arching trip to the overarching strategy that he's pursuing and the White House has calculated that whatever damage they do it's much less than the potential gang\nWhat Trump is doing is really trying to mobilize his core supporters um they may only be about thirty percent of the electorate perhaps a little less\nBut they tend to be older and white and more inclined any way to turn out in a midterm election but their enthusiasm\nIsn't nearly as high or at least it wasn't at the beginning of the fall as the Democrats who were I'm anxious to try to sort of punch Trump in the nose and elect for women elect more progressive into Congress so he is doubling down on these issues\nThat are very important to his core base and particularly the ones who are higher propensity voters like immigration than a century of sense of cultural risk for Americans\nLike trade 'em like law and order like uh being pro law enforcement\nAnd the calculation is that how much this may antagonize the anti Trump people their enthusiasm couldn't be much higher than it already was their propensity to vote couldn't be much higher than it already was but by having him go around to all these\nHigh visibility rallies and hitting these very passionate issues he'll bring up the enthusiasm on his side and bring up there a propensity to vote\nHe looked forward time earlier this year as the president might not be able to bring up immigration without having to deal with the ah very thorny issue of the separation of families\nNow that that was something that hurt him badly particularly among suburban women a and a married women her off in a swing constituency in American politics um and that is a risk that by bringing this up he'll bring up memories of that but\nThey they sort of are in the strategic situation which they are and they have a set of problems and they're just going to pursue the strategy that both\nThe president thinks is gonna be the most likely to succeed but also one that kinda fits the president's personality and style and the president's personality and style is to be aggressive and use his ability to promote himself and his celebrity as a political tool\nAnd this is actually you know we haven't talked about this but I've been reading some polling storage saying that the presidents of polling numbers are actually a for him at\nHighs for so for ... in in his term [noise] um what's ... what's that went down there resolve this speaking is that is that the health and drug is number so\nI think it's partly the speaking but it's also like he's getting stuff done I'm ... you saw his poll numbers go up with a tax plan that admittedly Republicans are not campaigning on they're finding is somewhat unpopular but at least he got something done for those people who wanted\nBut at least he got something done for those people who wanted corporate tax cuts in who really believed in a more supply side economics cause that is important constituency in the Republican Party likewise getting Kavanaugh confirmed\nEven though it was a messy process and\nThere were as you know accusations about Kavanaugh and you know sexual assault he nonetheless got a fit conservative justice on the Supreme Court that was very important to another constituency another large an important constituency in the Republican Party\nAnd he showed them that he is delivering for them and that they're\nSort of bet that among a Christian conservatives that I'm a\nBacking a price divorced um you know obscenity using a politician would um it rode bound to the benefit of their interests but starting to pay off with the judges and with the particularly the high visibility Supreme Court just\nJudge so to me that kind of makes sense when you accomplish things than your popularity goes up his popularity still well below fifty percent but it's it's it's showing another part of the Republican base that he does deliver for them\nLike turning Bloomberg News White House deputy team leader thank you yeah politician who's the president said he's doing what he said he he promised during his campaign so\n... what's his poll numbers coming up on Bloomberg Politics policy power in law the Harvard race bias suit continues as it seems destined for the Supreme Court but first we go back to Bob mode for check on the national news buff\nJulie the plane tickets lawyer said in his opening statement that affirmative action wasn't on trial but the plaintiffs want to eliminate all considerations of race in college admissions so how do you view this lawsuit\nYeah [laughter] and you know the goal of the ... I Would say a really at the heart of it they are putting a preventive action on trial of very much so\nHarvard said the percentage of Asian Americans admitted to the college has grown by twenty seven percent in the last eight years the Asian Americans make up almost twenty three percent of the year's freshman class what is the strongest point you see Harvard presenting in its defense besides numbers\nBut probably continue I said if the disclosure that I served as a consultant expert other case on the side of Harvard [noise]\nUm I think the strongest point that they could make a formative action um health Asian American by opening the door to different types of Asian American applicants um and also give institution the ability to look beyond just test scores than GPA's\nThe plaintiffs the applicants who said they were unfairly denied admission are not being called by their attorney to explain their position how unusual is that in a civil case and Mike the defense attorney call them\n[noise] yeah I'm not sure whether the defense plans to call them um [noise] you know I'm not a legal expert I Can't speak to how common are uncommon that is up but it is interesting you know that the plane to themselves um wouldn't be called to testify\nLet's try to put the suit into context the use of race in college admissions has been under attack since the Supreme Court upheld affirmative action without ... in ... where does it stand now as far as the Supreme Court is concerned\nThe Supreme Court has continued to affirm the legality of race conscious admissions and all that means and the context is just\nBeing able to understand a student's race ethnicity and assessing their application and there are potential contribution to the um [noise] to the student body in terms of um well they contribute to a third of a diverse and I'm vital student body\nAnd so it's absolutely nothing like quotas it's absolutely nothing like caps on any groups just because those things are illegal\nNow there was testimony today about Harvard also trying to maintain a ... from the from the plaintiffs from trying to maintain a socio economic\nBalance as well and the the concept of legacies getting an extra step up and donors of you know the children of donors getting an extra step up in the admissions process came up how do you see that\nThe admissions are complicated um yeah I think that they do occasionally undermine equity and within college admissions and so they should really be given a really hard look at 'em yet be really looked at 'em with a critical eye [laughter]\nUm but very much I'm like uh the admissions definitely a different thing from affirmative action\nIf if the plaintiffs got their way Wendy it wouldn't the admissions process only be based on grades and you know scores in the SATs\n... they'll I'd only harboring would continue to do and other institutions would be able to do some level of a holistic with\nContinue to do and other institutions would be able to do some level of a holistic review or they could look at other potential factor as they would very much they'll look at the essay or things like that [noise]\nUm but very much a student's race or ethnic uh students read ethnicity is you know potentially a very big part of their life story and they might not be able to access that information so\nI think one writer and the New York times even call that I've had Shaw a threat of censorship right unions are able to showcase right there at the end their culture and how those experiences have potentially affected them\nIt when I was looking at the the different kinds of evidence that have come in at the trial I noticed that they had what they seem to be attacking is one part of the analysis which focuses on the individual so the interview the student activities report and\nThat it is there any question that that can be allowed in as part of the determination of whether or not to accept a student\n[noise] um you know I think all of the higher obligation it's very much weight and I sat in um you know informing the admissions offices um assessment of he didn't so really I think anything is fair game\nAll right well this this trial is is still going on and it's going to be probably into another week at least thanks so much for joining us that's Julie park she's a professor at the University of Maryland

Wilson is our stocks editor at Bloomberg they're both here to help us make sense of the markets they want to start with you so ... what are you saying is this an earnings story today what's happening\nIn large measure it is because there are enough disappointments and enough concerns out there to take down stocks broadly\nNo if you go through the individual numbers I mean there are definitely some bright spots let's put it this way today is the busiest third quarter earnings season for the Dow Jones industrial average at five companies reporting cow already mentioned the two disappointments out of that group caterpillar and three and\nA cat it's all about a rising costs\nFrayed materials stop me if you've heard this story before nonetheless it's really coming home to roost so you see that stock down seven percent at the moment\nYou know similar story Brianna they're cutting their earnings forecast for the third time this year they came up short way short on profit relative to what analysts were looking for\nAnd the stocks down five percent so you know those are sort of the marquee names and then you go beyond that you see in the United technologies up two and a half percent were rising up three point three percent highly at San hose up five point eight percent so they put it all together it's not that everything is terrible but there are enough disappointments\nYou know beyond the Dow stocks right to uh to really come way on the market\nHere is there's something to be said that when investors are reacting to companies specific story try as three and they've got some problems that they're cutting their profit forecast again you know when when you look at caterpillar which has been kind of a multi year\nStory the ... trying to get itself back on track and then you have the United technologies that you know okay and that's just like what am I here waned when investors can separate the good from the dad I don't know what does that say that the overall market environment\nI mean it's it is interesting too not just look at the headline because other areas that are up today are some of the areas that have just gotten totally covered lately you support the homes rallying the law you our home builders have gotten crime\nAnd the thing is it's not like they blew the doors off but there gets a point where the market gets so beaten down\nAnd so like you're jumping over a one foot hurdle night and that's all it takes and I think we're ... may be assigned with some of the home builders there's just been so brutal\nThe caterpillar charge is really something though because it looked like it had been doing well and it's basically down around twenty percent since October third it's pretty as I say they're lying on a straight line down now it's often lows of the day maybe it wasn't quite as dismal but to some extent I mean like you know they\nThey're going to be a bellwether for the global economy and there's only so much they can do in right now people are kind of pessimistic about a lot of stuff and until that changes or\nCaterpillar going to do their business is selling really expensive stuff to industrial stuff like\nThat and you go and you care about what they have to say because they have their own and you know group of economists who are looking at the uh the world and you know issuing a forecast ideas and guiding their team and so when they come out and say things you can only do set up and take note one thing\nI Want to know so they ... their recent peak or was October third which was the same day German Powell set out said that the fed was a long way from neutral shows you want to blame the logo fan for the stock market sell off I Would use that as a\nPoint of a local fad president\nSay I'd like to say I think we got to wrap it up a load trucks that it's not going to get any better than that day Wilson has stocks editor Bloomberg you'll be back with us with your chart and stock of the day later on in the show and Joe was in the markets editor for Bloomberg sending you off to make some television would you miss coming up at four pm\nWall Street time actually do the bite yeah let's do that I like this when Fifteen billion Fifteen\nBillion today so the ceremonial opening at the Fifteen billion dollar I thought the picture that citizen day break a on a terminal today's ceremony on opening of the Fifteen billion dollar thirty four mile bridge linking Hong Kong can a cow and Gen high across the math at the Pearl river\nSo now you can just drive across to Macau to gamble it's the world gets the crossing opening to the public eye on Wednesday tomorrow and the ferry ride no longer standing between hung on gamblers and the nearest casinos actually do that it is that they do you think about the traffic they can get into that you know get in there\nYes actually did that it is a big deal about the traffic they can get into that you know get in their ... and that's a market that every uh gaming CEO talk about all the time it was a strength to it has been a strength of when and weaknesses Caesar's\nYeah exactly can go back caterpillar front and center of our story where it says the chief financial officer just saying we can't just grab that fast forever I Want to see if I was\nLike whoa that's why the ... moves down sorry we're just getting started on this Tuesday you listen to Bloomberg Businessweek live from the Bloomberg interactive brokers studio All right let's get some world and national\nNews that we turned about moon and our eleventh Rio newsroom have off the streets and Carol thank you there is growing global condemnation of the murder of Saudi journalist ... the latest\nFrom the G ... and the European Union in the strongest possible terms says the statements that she seven foreign ministers say explanations for the killing leave questions unanswered\nAlong with ... she's senior industrial Allen said Bloomberg intelligence both in our Bloomberg interactive brokers studio Joe let me start with you so caterpillar what happened\nWell I think to to give us some credit over here to to Karen who who said or out of here down no matter what these guys do it almost seems like the markets are going to like it and so when they came out with their earnings today the showed slightly higher on revenue slightly higher and higher on the PS but of course they didn't raise their outlook for twenty Eighteen their\nShare buybacks aren't as big as everyone expected and so they're taking quite ahead and I spoke to the CFO after the earnings call and said well nobody asked you directly why are you getting penalize so much in the market today despite saying but things are pretty good a caterpillar and he admitted listen\nThere is macroeconomic uncertainty out there and the ... the market is nervous and well we're not being impacted directly by the things that are out there we believe that maybe indirectly this might be the case of why we're getting swallowed up and all of it\nBut he also that you can't go that fast forever yeah it is a really amazing gum and yeah and I said yeah I mean you said it right and said you just can't go that fast forever and pointed out when you were looking quarter to quarter of a quarter for third quarter we only grew Eighteen percent margins\nAre sales or versus\nGordon Moore last third quarter was twenty five percent and and continue to tell me all McCall twenty Seventeen was very good and so you know it's hard to build off that\nI just got to say I kind of love the honesty but you know Karen I Am thinking that the PR consultant sort of like behind him or anything like that are related to that high watermark what's going on a caterpillar we had been talking about a cat\nFor many years the U.S some of the bad acquisitions and money they put out for a boost Cyrus and so on and so forth as the big kind of being\nAll in on mining um I don't know do you think investors have it wrong\nAnd and these in in a cyclical group they always a anticipate and and uh this is more than I Would have thought for sure um cat had some very late cycle businesses like mining like some of the energy related stuff\nUm you know that's forty percent of the company and it's really just kind of starting to get kicking what probably will slow as construction um\nAnd the other thing margins are extraordinary and they're still more to go um but they needed to raise and need ... I think if they raised they still would have been down state and you know didn't raise enough it's just that kind of market people are very worried about the tariffs it's having a they have an increasingly big impact\nOn on cost uh not everybody can get price increases to offset Europe is definitely showing slower Seinfeld oh cat didn't see it but some companies did say it still does just nervousness you know and\nAnd so Joe you Karen rightly mentioned terrorists rightly mentioned this idea that this feels like a broader story it take us inside the hall like well what were the questions like in the in\nThose contacts yeah I mean I think they were just trying to get someone to admit a caterpillar that you can't just look at caterpillar in a vacuum um and unfortunately or fortunately or however you bet the company I'm\nIn this isn't this is an executive ... now that are relatively new two years and they're really sticking by their guns and to the book and they they said back in their investor conference last September\nHere's what we expect in terms of revenue and we're doing all these ... within the company and they continue to point out listener backlogs we're not giving like double order backlogs like we did in the last time that we had a downturn in twenty twelve\nUnfortunately everybody kind of already understood that and just kind of reiterating his points doesn't really seem to help the case at least when it comes to trading on the stock\nWas there anything in the earnings release that you didn't get answered\nA you know it's funny I'm not that it matters that all but there are in their in their um guidance it really wasn't a race cars there was a sixteen cent tax benefit that nobody even talked about because given it to stop down as much kind of doesn't matter really yeah but that was that was one question um I think and\nUh you know I guess China they answered and and any other questions and I think this was a good question they kept a dollar a dollar spread on the ironing with one quarter left\nNow do you do the math they are going to probably get to the high end of that that um but\nAnd you said that as you said they want to just you know they want to set the goal and not be adjusting at all the time they said look you know and they're right if they had gone narrative fifty cents people would have said oh my God they lowered the high end of the range so they couldn't win so they kept at the same way about a minute left here I like caterpillar\nAnd I were the high end of the range so they couldn't win so they kept at the same we have about a minute left here I like caterpillar because they do work around the world they play into sectors that kind of tell us what's going on in the global economy Fifteen seconds joke what did you get from pat in terms of what's going on in the global economy\nI think the last point which I assume out terrorists the CFO afterwards\nHe said a hundred to two hundred million dollar hit you only announced forty million in the first in the third quarter so that means Italy's sixty million they said yeah and I said so are you going to say it could be less than a hundred ... million they said no we're just sticking to it will be the pretty much the very bottom in low end of that which tells you that they're still doing All right this is the way the mark attract\nA percentage of revenues it's not that much care and just quickly Fifteen seconds what did you get from\nCat about what's going on the global economy it looks good every region was really you know on on the line however I didn't get that feel from three and so it kind of matters where where you are and we didn't get into that so um you know we'll we'll touched on that little bit later on 'cause the

we're not campaigning in them we're not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied on the generic 'bout\nIn and all I can tell you is I I look at the issues that are going to matter ... things happening you see this a little bit with Stacey Abrams\nOr in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise
