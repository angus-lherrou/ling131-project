I wanted to look at that you know that I was twenty\nBut same circumstance that you get one mile man medium didn't see eye to eye but\nEventually I worked it out before we you know he passed on but yeah and my mom was left a widowed so that's why I stayed right and it wasn't until my sister\nHad divorced and she moved back here whether you know that's why I stayed so long but it's true what they said I think a lot of these people are seeing that every marriage is not I don't even know why anybody gets married anymore because it doesn't last so that's my opinion\nBut no we broke up what you said how old you are when you moved out how old were you\nI was twenty eight\nOr twenty twenty and what have you moved out of twenty you because you won't get along with your dad\nNo no I I I I stayed because I was in college I had to live\nUnder the under their rules writer I liked it or not right okay so I was forced to swallow my pride but then being my dad started working it out and then that surely he passed away when I was twenty six at that point you know my mom was widowed by herself I stayed with her and tell my sister got divorced and then you know she moved back in\nOr you aren't monitored not area you know oh yeah oh yeah well not remarried already for thirty five year yeah thirty five year\nAll right so you're saying the difference between our generation to generation now is that today they're saying why even bother because nobody stays together but but you obviously you're an example of somebody who does\nExactly but now that everybody shares our beliefs believe it or not especially the millennials especially the Obama ...\nWhy don't I think they are taught not to because the belief system used to be pretty universal in this country suddenly we're raising a generation of people that just don't even have that same values as do it's weird it's Charles things for the phone call it's very odd to me it just ... we're we're in a different place now let me go to a Cody Minnesota Tony what's up\nHey how's it going man limited dream dude what's up\nYeah gets comments for yet so\nI'm I was thinking to myself and kind of an example you know before I really wanted to really meet anybody I wanted to figure out myself first right you know go to school start a business is\nGetting a good job of that stuff move out kind of get settled in and then start looking however it while you're starting to see a lot of millennials snow and myself you know you have all these apps on the phone all the dating apps it's like you can get shop you know for whatever you're looking for you can go on a date um\nCan meet somebody you know and you can decide yeah this ... this person's not and they kinda just move on and it was interesting is that actually after I got all off of all of this crap I'm you know I met somebody organically and um I'll probably marry this woman\n... what does organically look like in twenty Eighteen how do you meet somebody off of digital ... solution kind of\nJust like your I Would say like just through your friends you know somebody who knows somebody else who was on you know one of these dating apps and they're just kind of striking out or you know they're just\nLike a kind of get to play it and you just kind of meet somebody who has gone through the same thing as you write like well let's get off this crap let's just go out together and have a good time and see where it goes so it\nKind of have to go you kind of have to go through\nYou know going out I'll tell you at nine times out of ten of millennials they've been on one of these apps for some period of time and after they kind of experience it and realize that there's not much good stuff out there they get off of it and then they just need people the way that people used to me you know a few friends hanging out um\nWhen that's the tried and true way and then my opinion\nI Gotcha and I hear you and I think that people should do it organically like that you actually meet somebody face to face\nOr you meet somebody you work you meet somebody I mean it used to be a church right or or you meet somebody ... you actually meet somebody you get to get to you know to see the look on their ... their face in their expression when they're writing to you or or ... you know you get to hear the sarcasm where you get to see the way they smile or there's a twinkle in there I just it's the old way of doing it\nBut I guess in today's day and age when of course I've never been an exit dating apps but you could swipe one way do you like the person's wife the other way to get rid of them I mean it's it's it's it's kind of ... and\nIt is I don't know how they do it I don't I don't like that I don't know how you date today doing all that I'm On social media and again shopping [laughter] no I don't like it\nOr who who says that that pictures real anyway well shop couldn't meet the person looking at and what will happen right actually\nMeet somebody and then figure out of your attracted or if you like\nTo have you on your ... that's an I imagine a cup of coffee or something it'd be Cruz's old fashioned I D I like it\nWould be very quickly go to a senior Wu accuser city and Patrick ... got like a minute maybe haven't\nGotten our Joe thanks for your let me ask you about you know I I was ... I was born in eighty one I've been married Thirteen Years ago my brother was born in eighty eight I'm going to say somewhere between Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty eight we started telling kids that you can get participation groceries and sports life\nAnd your your work doesn't matter for an outcome so they have unrealistic expectations of what their new place to look like and they just moved up their parents to LA until they get what they think works and it takes 'til they're twenty eight or thirty eight that's what effect\nWill clearly in your house that was the timeline I don't know if that's the timeline everywhere but I think that makes a lot of sense to me there's something has changed\nTo where you know ... it went from practice as hard as you can and you'll be able to win a trophy and whatever sport it is that you chose or you know a few years later it was just going to show up and if you don't get a trophy all yell at the at the coach and shoot a lead something there changed as well that could ever want to do with it\nIt is I edit a nine point one pack Senate eight nine four one Seventy four seven what the hell's going on with the stock market we talked to a regime that associates Doug ... when we come back and we drove ...\nNineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet and in that regard I have to tell you this is really profound to thanks [noise] first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in in income or into a household and then what goes out for ... like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income go into debt service has the lowest level since the mid seventies\nAnd household networks in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion all time high yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nBut it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales we've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat\nThan they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash 'em but you know what the media does the media has to find a ... if it bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's why they're leaving with it but when people generally watch it when you when you talk to your investors the people that that you work with\nOr do they call you immediately say oh my God what do we do\nOr did they say wow this kind of crazy going to go out to eat now\nYeah so I you know what I mean nobody causes nobody calls me with their dinner plans [laughter] I'm gonna I'm gonna from now on with the British it call 'em so I Do get\nSome people are concerned of course in that apprehension that's obvious and makes sense logical also get folks on the other side that are looking to do some buying but\nLet me give you a little perspective so the market bottomed in March of oh nine so I was following the meltdown of oh eight and nine we have had this ... this will be the twenty third but we've had twenty three now correction sense over nine five percent or more and they average I sent this out the clients this morning and just to give some perspective [noise]\nTwenty three times since nine that what we're going through right now is happening average decline as nine point three percent were down about six or seven now um but even today Joe I'm now seeing on my screen as I'm watching a in real time we're starting to see some of the stocks the leaders\nAh which were technology and these are the names we all know Amazon Microsoft Apple Facebook companies\nUm we're down early today than down hard this month but now starting to sure I mean Facebook as an example and this is not a recommendation on Facebook but the stock was in August\nThat over two hundred and ten dollars a share\nThe day is traded on the one fifty now it was read earlier down on that day but now it's green Microsoft same thing it was lower early today now that's turned up so it looks like we're starting to see a little bit of selective buying\nThe average stock and this ... needles moving but the average stack sense to sell off happen is down about Fifteen Percent well\nPretty big correction yeah now here's the thing to you mentioned this it kind of in passing is too expensive is it over done the market is trading at about the price earnings ratio which that's just simply the price divided by earnings about sixteen probably right that a sixteen point to sixteen point three\nThe twenty five year average sixteen point one\nSwitch right words to throw them\nYes yeah you're not cheap so it's not like oh nine when everything was on sale but you're certainly not at twenty three twenty four times what you're saying he's were forty percent overvalued now we're smack at the twenty five year average right now\nAnd he's a dog I Would imagine director and senior vice president Raymond James and associates a always incredible knowledge let me ask you something off the beaten path and and you know were Twenty one years no do you and told me that I'm not as smart as you so you're about to prove it here um\nGas partly what I Do write a\nGas prices go down we're happy gas prices go down because the price per barrel goes down so we're happy with the gas pump the price per barrel goes down with the stock market generally speaking goes down and we're all supposed to freak out be angry that that the stock market is going down so\nAgain maybe maybe this was completely outlandish\nShould we get to the point to where we don't have these valuable resources like gasoline like liquefied natural gas like going to blame you know I'm I'm utility but we all need\nMaybe we don't have those on the stock market and the reason why I say that is we're happy when the prices go down with the prices will go down the stock market goes down is I Would guess and it could be wrong but it's rare to see the price per barrel of gas go down and the stock market go up\nSo how do you feel is somebody who does this for a living and you've done for as long as I've known you when you do it very well how do you feel about those being connected is that right just to have gasoline per barrel on the stock market or not because again it seems to be the opposite of what I Want I Want lower gas prices but I Want my stocks to be well\nYeah that's an interesting question so you you really can't a separate those for a couple of different reasons a number one is you have companies like\nChevron and acts on as an example yeah I'm right there publicly traded so they're going to be on the exchange just like home depot and apple are going to be on the exchange that\nThe commodity itself um oil in this case or natural gas as you were mentioning those are the importance of course it until\nUh in this case or natural gas as you were mentioning\nThose are the importance of course into a lot of different products right and so you have to have a market price and you know if you look at commodities you can buy cattle hogs oil and natural gas platinum played in whatever it's all out there with a\n... I Want to I Want to I Want to interject this though 'cause I I see where you're going and it makes sense but like you brought up apple let's talk about apple I've got an iPhone or I Want to go by the new iPhone right\nAn apple stock dumped today Fifteen Percent they're not going to drop the price of the iPhone tomorrow because their stock price went down but at the price per barrel of oil goes down to the stock prices go down to those oil companies I Am going to pay pay less for it at the gas pump\nSo I guess my question is is it okay but what we actually pay us consumer seems to be directly tied to the price per barrel which is for some reason in flux because of what's happening we stock market\nMaybe I vote is going to change price because apple danger lost money today by phone is the iPhone that's what it costs that's what the plant is right\nYeah okay so the or let a lithium battery\nLittle smarter than you thought I was ...\nIt actually makes no sense whatsoever and I'm trying to [laughter] come on who they are really only a ruby back home\nCome home yeah yeah yeah so at this year's us dissect the iPhone for an example we all know they have lithium batteries yes so let's see him as a commodity right um so that's going to trade up and down just like crude oil\nThat's part of the cost structure for Apple now they might do things to hedge that\nInput cost if they think lithium prices are going to run away to the upside because they don't want the iPhone going for um a thousand twelve hundred just because the battery went up by two hundred by right um so\nIt's a hard question to answer I think the short answer is no ah oil is part and parcel to the equation\nAre both just as the raw commodity and then all of the ... of that which are directly energy companies but then more broadly two plastic on an iPhone right uh well guess what that comes from where oil right so it's just it's it's just there\nWas an apple is in effect that I think the right answer is from the dumb guy perspective here the right answer is apple already mark set up by a hundred percent so if they're only making Ninety five percent markup I think they're still going to be okay and that really is true it cost them exactly half\nOf what of what they're charging for an iPhone so I guess where you've got that kind of wiggle room you can you can survive in the next time we speak give me your favorite let's talk about why\nThe price per barrel of oil is it lower for us specifically when we're exporting now more than we've ever\nExported and we're actually exporting now more than we're importing out a great question from a call yesterday who said if we're we've got all this oil why we keep on exporting it let's just keep it refunded ourselves and I know that it's a it's a global market that's why but maybe you can break down exactly how that works next time can we do that\nYeah you bet that's easy All right it is um duck or it's not easy easy is not easy for them for the layman over here\nAll right it's Doug handler he's the managing director senior vice president of investments Raymond James and associates Doug always rate knowledge thanks man\nI tell my pleasure back after this will be Joe pack so stay right here\n\n[noise]\n... yeah [noise]\n\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone else Felix lead built this lead quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the answers to match your body type\nAnd sleep references to the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper like a plush or for bad which he looks there is no more gassing or confusion just go to sleep dot com slash packs pigs are too many sleep quiz they're going to match you to a mattress that will give you the best sleeve\nOf your life you'll excuse even split the mattress down in the middle providing individuals support needs and feel preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty and you get to try out for a hundred nights\nRisk free right now he lives is offering up to a hundred twenty five dollars off all mattress orders get up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off at Hewlett sleep dot com slash bags that's yielding sleep dot com slash P.

Sebastian Gorka is the author of why we fight his new book defeating\nAmerica's enemies with no apologies\nDevote himself in the book to foreign affairs this is a man who came to us because of the violence of these last decades he was in hungry on the nine eleven attack and he's here now as the national security strategy dumb Fox News although the author of why we fight but we turn to\nPartisan politics in the United states because we've got days to go to the mid term\nThere is an advantage to the Democrats there's always an advantage to the party out of power in the White House it the ... mid term that's political science especially in the house of representatives following a close election which was twenty sixteen\nYou make your case you choose your candidates you take it to the people and you vote on one particular day however\nIt is impossible to ignore a remark made by a former attorney general at a steamed attorney as far as I can see Eric Holder\nRecommending that Democrats in these closing days of the of the campaign kick Republicans said I don't make any sense of this was he being clever does he do this all the time Eric Holder seems to have forgotten the responsibilities he has as a former attorney general\nA job the only attorney general than American history to ever be held in contempt of Congress\nBut the real cold or a man who while all of the sun in general publicly said\nI Am proud to be President Obama's winning by a that's not a kind of statement we expect from the scene yet Laura ... an officer of the the president so I I think it's fairly clear Eric Holder wasn't having us anything we didn't know when when\nWhen you said if your enemy is down you just kick them because what have we just with this little off\nThe metal they stalling reputation with twelve is on the federal bench\nIn the space for one week going from having a book lists rectal than being accused the bidding multiple rapist to drought were women when he was in high school what Eric Holder was talking about it my my fear is\nThat the ... the new law what we saw on Saturday Rick ... presidents\nIs that the ... the new law what we saw on Saturday with the president Shockley righteously declaring drop\nThis kind of a nose and us from the White House or the my expectation was maybe the Democrats are looking at the mirror and say okay\nWe went to her about according to Eric Holder the worst is yet Rick I'm\nNow here's the puzzle sap that house look very favorable for the Democrats and that what that is what you expect to pick up at the first midterm uh the first president say as a first term of a new president the Senate does not looked favorable for them that probably has to do with the cabinet story we've seen\nNumbers moving the Republican way in Nevada in in Montana in Missouri in North Dakota in Arizona and we've seen numbers move in Tennessee ... the Republican way in the Senate but not in the house so\nI'm exasperated to understand why Eric Holder and also Mrs Clinton\nWould use language recommending not just incivility but aggression aggression towards Republicans you win on election day you don't win intimidating people and this idea that you take it to the streets with pay\nOr what looks to be a subsidized protesters that that's not the mark of somebody who has confidence that they're going to win at the back of the ballot box\nI it's just a function I I Believe and you're right or Hillary Clinton said it'll end that that we will be have all fell off the we win\nThat's not the American coal pack that any kind of social contract that I've ever heard of at least in the representative democracy or republic so yes I I think it's very clear that this is just what happens when you're all policies\nRight at the ballot box but you still the mom to be in power whether it's this much and innocent man so that you can maintain control of the Supreme Court to turn it into a law making body or whether it is doing the kinds of things we saw it on the streets of Washington D.C.'s\nI return to my Republicans\nTo say that violence is unacceptable violence you win at the ballot box you don't win in the street you don't win by confronting people in the subway or at the coffee shop you win at the ballot box and any ... any Republican who thinks that violence is going to be successful is foolish I ... I\nDon't want to I don't want to associate with them that's a pretty simple thing to say and Mrs Clinton and Eric Holder could say\nYes but it's not our job you're absolutely right this has to come from the leaders of the Democratic party we have to do this\nFrom the ... but they're not going to say it when you have the leading left wing media talking heads saying well it's not a mob really being chased out of the restaurants are creating a situation where Iran ... wife mouth so she has to sleep with a loaded\nGun ... bedside and of course this is let's not forget whatever you think of Rand Paul's politics this is a man who was on the baseball field as James Hodgkinson they Bernie Saunders all it was firing his rifle and trying to kill\nAll the Republicans got shot the baseball game or most succeeding in killing Representative Steve ... so you know there's only one side of the political landscape critters normalizing violence or allowing it to be used as a tool without college\nAnd it happened to be the Democrat Party John\nFinally just have a little fun here at the end let's be positive Kanye West in the oval office today was was you can't produce that that just got to happen that that was that was his turn right there at ... I'm Still trying to figure out what it meant but it certainly was happy to watch\nYeah I I I'll tell you what it means it means that\nI don't know who it is where the bills signed the new head of the press and admitted to the White House or whether the president himself the White House has internalized the most important message with the late Andrew Breitbart\nThe politics is down the street from culture Kanye with one five minute cultural inject\nIt more than any political tone it through the Republican Party is I'm\nThe last two years so uh yeah it was history and it's a very different kind of history but it was politics as much as it was culture\nI liked the laughter sad I liked the laughter in the ... miles in the oval office even even the troubled media who don't seem to understand that we're enjoying ourselves and our prosperous time were laughing I saw them all laughing\nI I ...

of Panama City in Mexico beach as a category for Fox\nWell John I wrote this this essay at National Review online a which appeared yesterday in response to a series of opinion pieces that have come out recently that was arguing that we were we were doing wrong by making investments in increased capacity meaning growing the size\nOf the Army Navy air force in the navy and in fact these uh these other voices were arguing that the money would be better spent in in investing in increased capabilities the more high technology and my argument was that was strong civilian leadership we can do both and in fact we must\nSo the U.S military has a broader strategy of both attempting to preserve the peace that currently exists which requires that we have capacity to have presidents and all the areas where we have interest\nWhile also increasing capabilities are so that we have a war winning capabilities when we need them and so the argument I make in here is it's possible to do both that's it's possible literally to walk and chew gum at the same time\nBut I think that there's been sort of a series of false straw man that's been thrown out there that attempt to say we either must do one or the other uh and I think there's some other political um you know arguments are in the background that money would be better spent in other areas\nOr that the physical environment is getting too constrained with rising a debt and deficit but you know we're in a great power competition and we need to make the right investments to be able to survive within that competition or we don't we lose we decline\nAnd therefore area denial so we have the ships to do it you know two eighty three fifty five what were we put another three fifty five so it can deal with the Chinese aggression\nWell again we need to continue the investment in these high end destroyers which we just purchased a I had more over the next five year but we also known by need to buy those forget so you and I discuss on many of them what\nAbout air frames Jerry what what would the navy need to deal with the Chinese threat\nFor the navy needs to make it a significant investment in modernizing its carrier air wings in order to get additional long range or aircraft back on the carrier deck and now I have repeatedly called\nFor significant investments in unmanned long range precision strike platforms in order to have the aircraft carriers be relevant\nUp against some of the new modern standoff anti access systems with the Chinese and the Russians are employing and right now we have not done that so that is an area where the navy needs to make a substantial investment to bring new capabilities on the carrier deck in order for that the aircraft carrier or to continue to exercise influence in the future\nHowever the Decatur incident uh we're not going to build a fleet overnight do we have the capability right now to deal with the increased ten grand aggression in the south China Sea or in any of the passages in the first time and change\nRight now we're holding our own but just barely a so the Chinese are building up rapidly and in fact in in just a few years they will have a larger navy than we do a a larger navy that's not as capable but the problem that we face as China only has to be great\nOr over ... in one area of the world right now which is essentially the western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean whereas we still have to maintain security everywhere in the world that we have interests which is broadly everywhere\nSo uh our forces are spread thin we need to build up as rapidly as we can unfortunately right now the Navy's buildup plan to three fifty five does not get us there until the twenty fifties and that will be far to a\nFar too late Jerry Hendricks captain Jerry

I Know the the reason for you because politicians are cowards and they want to keep the job of the time you tackle a serious problem\nIt probably is still a problem because there's some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well that's what the get elected for was to tackle these issues\nNow I see that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study by Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude is published by um cowed her books subtitled but last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us today\nOf a last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight my pleasure good to be with you Jim absolutely are your thoughts if you would on on the\nWitness trend really began and and how it has managed to avoid being challenged in court because to me it as it is a uh imminently challenge a bowl of there'll be such a word\nBut it's it's a very much challenge a bowl and I hope that this book will encourage the court to start looking at this issue but it really began I think in ... what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties in about Nineteen twenty\nWhen there are many social and economic changes going on in the country and the people\nWho are then progressive is led by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt\nThought that the constitution was just too rigid to deal with all of these problems and so we had to make some major constitutional changes apply to a lot of smart or a ... ... people who had no interest in a particular issue but we're credential than an intelligent\nAnd we make decisions on the basis of what is best for the country\nAnd they thought of those people as it ministry leaders and officials of the government they wanted more such people to be put into place in the federal government and make many more regulatory and administrative decisions that was how it all began\nAnd uh it has developed since then through a whole series of decisions made and made in the government and made by the people in some cases when they elected Woodrow Wilson is president so that\nCall us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about a hundred and thirty year victory mountains covered crossing permission and conditions people

and elsewhere but the three letters or a good place to start of essentially writing general outlines of laws and letting him the the agency's fill in the details right the laws\nAnd uh so I'm going to be done about that uh we have a call from dark who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison than the good evening doc welcome\nThank you for taking my call is ...\nJust a weren't too quick questions for his ... just set aside less it of course there's always Mr Austin where you see this court has like a President Trump on her opportunity under justice Gorsuch cabs cab at all and if there is no justice appointed us to a second dropped or what your does why it\nJust you just court filing turning back to the out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future it out or what are your thoughts are that sir\nBut you did you have two questions that that was just that was\nYour what you should accord going on to these justices and are you all over the future that we could turn back the tide of I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good of butter I Do see a going in other words I yeah I Will go to Jim Cavanaugh tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial fortitude\nYeah I actually think that this is very very hopeful\nI at in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kevin ... there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this position\nI'm the one that is most important here is one called ... that Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nDeclared that the lower court had to defer to the to the interpretations of various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely and so\nThat that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress or to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there\nHe's a constitutional list he's a text you list\nJust just like Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned\nAbout this question and now he has four other justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton expected them to take when he rose that ... that federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA while it it's a remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face the voters the courts don'ts\nIt's chicken but ... it's understandable they have to face with voters the courts don't what what are they so reluctant about\n[laughter] [laughter] I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nThey don't need support from the public good I mean if we don't even associate with the public they they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton was right and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThat judges lifetime appointments in this democracy um why shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches\nIn a democracy the elected branches the president that Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking\nFor the people the courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that\nThose decisions in Nineteen thirty five and the effort by the president after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court\nUm they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is a reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nWell we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota tonight good evening\nEither thanks for taking my call sure [noise] yeah I was going to mention I just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] but uh your guests mentioned was I think you know he said that a\nRepublican or a democracy and agree with that and I agree with you know kind of the time frame on each side of the problem started you know it's also around that time learn from what I've read where\nYou start became you know people started calling us a democracy and not a Republican I since then I've heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean look at one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's why although and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where those technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nOr we can even talk about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works or anything you want to add to that the Peter\n[noise] no I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatives I'm afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people governing through\nA legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so\nConservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThat democracy that the founders didn't like was democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in in some kind of um con or a conference or director but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the ... good idea that's right\nBut we'll we'll get we'll come back to that it's time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon in ... Missouri hello Sharon the\nGo ahead yeah it's kinda damp and Mr ... maybe I Am right off base back um\nDairy and movement could have a constitutional convention and ... are the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one that we had guessing that term limits for the legislative branch and me reigning power of\nExecutive orders as the president now if that is Dan\nAnd the legislature cannot I guess you have to worry about running for office and is there like it when we did that\nThat balance so that the courts possibly would any stat that kid that plate a little bit more because it's like to have to take more responsibility All right\nWell the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the courts actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself the ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for them just to pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions they're happy to be made\nFor the non coming up in a break that doesn't move here so we will apple pie on that thought when we come back in the moment\n\nTalk sports Ninety seven one FM W.

things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nIt it's in that in fact that's what we're talking about them that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress it\n... it or a ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough than you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary into Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nPresumably that was passed Gary into Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nGetting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get off on your your I agree with\nAlmost everything your guest has said I'm a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my my uh on yes and\nI think it really is we're getting into some addicts federally\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time to ... to explain it on your show but anyway um and then the\n... the main thing is that I Want to call about is the constitutional convention and that that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go off and right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without actually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThen most of the major changes that need to be made right now being term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress be at a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as exist has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used today we're all amendments start with Congress then we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBeauty let me add one thing they're ... and I think much of what you said is something that I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because I think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these bureaucracies\nHad but how do you ... how do you persuade short of of of some method of of of course\nUh uh how how do you persuade the uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they have gone down for decades and which they're quite happy with I mean so they're not just suddenly say gee Peter your rights so you're gonna\nHave to arm twist these people are going to have to drag them and I don't know how you do that just by saying please read his book is a great read but I don't think I'd want to do\nLet me suggest this and I I I agree that it's tough but we have five members of the Supreme Court now who are who are willing I think to take exactly the position that I'm advocating in the book\nAnd in fact judge Kavanaugh now justice Kavanaugh said in in a decision in twenty Fifteen when an agency went beyond what are the ... the statute authorized\nBut he was overruled at the at the court where he was serving but he said look when an agency take steps that are not authorized and its statute they have to go back to Congress and that's exactly what I Am talking about and I think we have five members of the court now who are willing to do that\n[noise]\n[noise] news talk more than one WDC radio\n\nNews CBS News on the hour resent us by liberty mutual insurance I'm Jim Taylor

I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I I I ... the the young people I Know by by that by my definition I'm Talking about a\nA parent's today's parents who are generally of course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not this category uh I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and yes that includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself up dusting yourself often end the whole learning experience is there any kind of a\nOf originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I've ever actually met a helicopter parents much less a lawnmower parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily reading analogy I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six into two thousand was Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to step away from that was probably the last four years\nI we get calls from parents go what do you mean my travel got us thirty on their cats go well I Can't even confirm if your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose any you

worried I thought you were a doctor uber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nA might have but I understand this was her first child\nHow 'bout that gray is is is a very ...\nAnd you know at first child you know they are at the store and they are in the living room they spent their pacifier out you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes before he can put it in a back in ... by the time she has her third kid you kind of dusted off it doesn't matter you know we're talking about\nThe third kid she become dusted off it doesn't matter you know where they get up out of gathering dust off their mouth [laughter] so so do you get more data that'll change how well she ... she goes by and they was doing oh\nWell All right now the ... and why is it yeah going going way with the author\nOr remind her that you know you you raise a child and spoil the grandchild or if you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah they have a common enemy [laughter] okay\nA little cynicism there for the program at the top in Port Angeles Washington good evening I'm\nOh gentleman a a well one of the things that generate show adopt their mom just the amount of legislation that's out there that you know the seat that the CDC the child to fill up the people\nIn a in in the communities can get word of something in your your child got injured or you know did you leave the play in the yard and this happened or the charge if the the car seat issue you know you have the right one for your head at at that age right there there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that\nYou would never even dreamed of as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my church is right\nAnd and my parents never would've dreamed you know that somebody would have a handgun\nAt the state or local level [noise] ah so that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering that used to write on the trucks predators are fifty three Chevrolet pickup truck and hang out with the truck\nYeah we can't ride in the bed in the truck now yeah exactly no I Know\nAnd and and and and it doesn't do the things that I could think of you guys go out ... ... ...\nWell that's what I hear your thoughts are Tom ... extent it has a government if not impose this on us at least encouraged is\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help and right and and what happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out\nThere and they raise this think and they stand\nUp in front of a school boards and governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things and post now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I I don't disagree with\nThat but you know uh I've\nBeen involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of people\nFollowing a pediatricians word to the ladder on a first child or something and the pediatrician assumed that oh you know they're an adult they'll they'll know the kids hungry you don't wait three hours to feed on even though I said you know they'll eat every three hours and all of a sudden you get child protective services involved\nIn it because you know the kids take being taken at the hospital because hey crying all the time and the other they think oh they're not feeding the kids\nAnd the mother is like no I'm seeing them just like the doctor told me every three hours\n[laughter] and it's crazy [laughter] it's scary for new parents especially young ones\nAnd uh they\nThey follow those rules and and what happens with kids they hit the public school system and they learn\nHey as your parents do this child abuse of your parents do that and child abuse and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook that says ... really you can do parents you know what you can\nWell a suffice it to say we somehow it Dr Huber managed to be here and I managed to get here and and the people in the audience managed to get here a\nCourtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess that the the old methods at least a do not to cause a ... a tremendous a fatality rate among young people that might be some

people died so far the coast guard\nIn Florida has rescued forty people in a sense of two hundred plus observers\nBecause there were people trying to ride it out that even more on boats et cetera\nSo

America Tonight close your eyes and imagine right now your house disappears before your eyes what does that feel like\nPretty much Michael left Mexico beach and shred completely shredded some of the photos and the video from there are\nI Would say shocking but we've seen this before\nIs very different and very personal though when it happens you good news is so many people came together including a hospital there where they got the most serious people out in other words there was a man who was waiting for a heart transplant there was a woman who's about to give birth\nAnd they were able to chapter chopper them out of the area thank goodness but it was a real kick in the stomach catastrophic damage six people at least I think there could be more killed by hurricane\nKick in the stomach catastrophic damage six people at least I think there could be more killed by hurricanes Michael one of the four most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the United states\nSo this wasn't oh\nLook pretty bad boys some of those trees were been at this was bad when we say ... for\nOne of the four worst hurricanes of all time you know we're not fooling on this one and the descriptions of it looked like a bomb we've heard that before when there's been catastrophic damage after tornadoes and other types of wind storms but boy nothing like this and you see the aerial views a thousand people I mean\nJust impacted plus with\nTrees cheered off tangles of power lines in the streets boats piled up like they were ... votes in a bath tub thrown upside down just things you don't normally see frankly and\nThe administrator of the FEMA so it it was like William long\nHe he thought he saw that you know what this isn't going to be put back together overnight it's time to be put back together next week the week after that the week after that this is the long haul that's what it is\nAnd then the storm moves up toward the north so there's power outages in Virginia and North Carolina about a hundred and forty five thousand Virginians didn't have power according to the department of emergency management\nAnd when we see something like this you know it makes me think of when people would make fun of me I'm In the ten years I've done the show you know we'd be talking about emergency go bags and things you had to do\nAnd sell it on the show and people will say oh come on really do I really think unless you have to have emergency kids are you really doing that and the answer is yes\nBecause imagine this is going to hit landfall what are you got packed up what about your documents 'cause wanted shredded like tooth picks you're not finding those bills you're not finding stuff that you need just fine to to get through or what you have to get through\n... and you're not finding it and hopefully you've got it written down somewhere and that's basically what it looks like it looks like people are just trying to piece things together I mean people lose all their belongings like that KUHF you're just stuck you know somebody said when they were asked about why didn't you get out\nI think are not even part of the equation off is terrible I have enough that I Know you cannot bring back a life in some of these cases of twisted sick\nDespicable inhuman act\nSo I think it's warranted of course if someone shouldn't receive the death penalty and it has been investigated to within an inch of any possible evidence that it would be the best case scenario since Thursday\nThe Washington and people are listening to us in Washington Washington Supreme Court declared its death penalty unconstitutional\nAnd um it's the twenties state to band or since banned anyway capital punishment the state's highest court didn't rule the death penalty illegal in of itself but rather the way it's been carried out so\nSaying that it's and it's arbitrary and racially biased\nA lot of people who are legal scholars say that this is the latest step toward the continued abolition\nOf the death penalty that this move\nAnd instead you know having these life in prison sentences is going to become more of the rule and the exception you know we've seen other legislatures turned things over court six hundred New Jersey New York\nAnd there was a nationwide moratorium on the death penalty that was lifted in the mid seventies so executions actually peaked\nAt Ninety eight Ninety nine but they've declined since that twenty three and twenty Seventeen Eighteen so far this year\nAnd it's the dilemma it's the moral dilemma it's the ethical dilemma it's the legal dilemma it's the wrestling with it it's people who disputed it's see because I'm open minded and look at all sides of it and I get that if you want it\nTo look at all my ideologies they well they don't match up and I don't care because that's why I say I don't care if you're left of left or right of writers somewhere in between or you say I don't need a label I Am who I Am and I vote for the person that I look at the issue\nAnd so for me diving deeper was the norm in my family and you made up your own mind whether people agree with you or not in your own family or outside of your own family\nI think the good thing is in the places where it slowed down when people were deciding the death penalty and the harshest punishment they could decide they ...\nPenalty and the harshest punishment they could decide they really took things into account let's say\nThey really taken into account now one of the big argument that I'll get is well it's supposed to be a deterrent but isn't really a deterrent how's that deterring heinous crimes because we're still things terrible things happen\nAnd I guess it depends yeah and it also depends on your philosophy sometimes religious belief\nCome into play are you an eye for an eye curse and do you really feel that way I just know from myself personally having covered crime a very young age and seeing some on believable a brutal things happened to completely innocent people just throwing their families\nMaking\nSo many wheat uncontrollably and bringing them to their knees like I've never seen before in my life and knowing that definitely they had nailed the case shut that this was the way to go and does it bring relief because it brings\nUp a a rapid\nLose then to tie up for the family know because once somebody is taken away you can never get them back\nAnd it doesn't necessarily have that feeling maybe some would say that but I think most it's the opposite they they say they thought they would feel\nThey would feel relief but they don't necessarily feel relief so where this goes is going to be pretty telling him pretty interesting I think\nI'm politically speaking ties to the past\nThat kind of thing but the fact that\nThe impact of the jury's decision as to impose the death sentence if there is a racist hate to it to the practice of it then no a African Americans make up about Thirteen percent of the U.S population they account for thirty four point three percent of the defendants who were executed\nThose are clearly statistics from death penalty in Information Center I'm Seventy six percent of the victims in that case\nAnd the cases that resulted in execution were white so this is where some of this discussion also goes to attitudes and numbers when\nAll of that and region and\nWhat the what\nPreviously was acceptable not being acceptable now I think it's always worth the debate and to have a discussion and look closer at it\nBut I think we're going to see that fall it's interesting because in ten years I think we're going to have legalized marijuana and every single state taxes maybe the last to do it I don't know but\nI Do think that's going to happen because of the money that's being made what it's doing for the states there are some really crazy things you have to deal with when you're talking about marijuana and legalizing it but I Do believe\nBased on what we're seeing with candidates companies in the even\n\nIn ten years\nI think it's legalized in ten years and I think there's so many other issues that we dance around or we talk about that it won't be any closer\nTo any sort of a solution or maybe even not even a compromise and the death penalty will be one of those there's still be unless it's a Supreme Court ruling there will be hold out and there will be\nOther states that will say no thank you\nAnd there's pressure to do that too because of mistakes that have been made and I get it\nAbsolutely\nIn the meantime you might not get what's happening with the market and I've got a bunch of emails from people talking about that asking me what's going on with the market you stuck on about finances I of course I'm\nNot a mistress the stocks and would not offer free advice I have tried to school myself in it yes we've had people on but I Do know this and I made some call today and we talked about the interest rates that's part of what you're saying\nSo the Dow down again NASDAQ down at the tea down and the question is wow the Dow drops five hundred points\nIt's sliding what's happening sliding five hundred and forty six points over two percent at close what does it mean it's another bad day huh that idea of the market correction decline of ten percent or more from the peak not out of the question\nA lot of senior investment strategist they're saying that at some of these big fun\nYou know in those corrections happen almost every year\nOne is probably unlikely to mean the end of that celebrate the bull\nLet's not celebrates the bulls aren't running any more I think it does sound effect but how far back and what is what stocks do that tech stocks they're really getting hammered and that's part of the Chinese tariffs story because of the concerns about that even\nJack Ma

sixteen\nEverybody got it wrong are we going to do that again here in twenty five days\nWell let me thank you very much has to do like to be with you or me let me tell a little different story though about that night I'm early on in the night we said and and I said\nThat it was a contested race and one of the things I think\nThat ... to a lot of the surprises in twenty six and when people were looking at these national polls and not looking at a at some of the state the state that put that race well let's let's get let's get into the president now we had a lot of national polls out there that say the Democrats are odd and that's that's fine and good\nBut his race is going to be decided and about sixty house districts about sixty at\nGetting the foreigners they already why it was one example of a district I Need to pay attention to\nOh well I it's hard to just one because there are so many that these are relatively large number but you've got a district outside of Dallas and outside of Houston you've got a handful of districts in orange County California\nYou've got to district in New Jersey eleven in northern New Jersey and I describe those from coast to coast because they're not your typical battle ground places\nThese are suburb suburbs of major urban areas where you've got slightly more affluent voters you've got a lot of voters with college degrees those are the kinds of voters the Democrats have been trying to pick off\nOr typically may vote for Republicans for Congress maybe this year they switch that the idea that behind their campaign any way so far\nWe see that being somewhat effective we see the Democrats as having a slight edge to take back the house\nBut and that's been moving over the summer butter I caution that go ahead\nMichael and Anthony I Want to ask a they ask you to make sense of this for us because of course you're the author of the book where did you get this number of pollsters guide to making sense of the world can you make sense of the midterms force if we were to wake up the day after what do you believe\nThe composition of the house and Senate will be\nWell here's the key thing that I think maybe your listeners will appreciate normally the party in power gets credit for the economy and does better when people say the economy is good right now we've got economic confidence Hi we've got an astounding number of people say the economy is good and yet\nThere is a third of voters who said that but they are voting for the party out of power they are voting for the Democrats because they do not like the direction of the country\nSo that things aren't as well correlated as they often are one big reason for that and that they don't like the president's performance in particular they gave him low ratings they don't like the politics they continue to see in Washington\nThat split between whether people vote on the economy which would have ... or whether people vote on wanting a change again not a voting against the president at least symbolically is the key one of the key dislike of groups there\nThe president at least symbolically key one of the groups there\nAbout a third of the electorate and that will determine what happened in the sky and these competitive house districts cash\nAnd say thank you so much Anthony ... of course will be appearing on face the nation as we move closer to the elections or you could hear a face in Asia this week on Bloomberg Radio I listen to it of course Sunday to two PM in New York Washington DC and now Bloomberg one of the six one\nUh Boston Newberry port let's face the nation the Sunday to Bloomberg Radio ... pin on CBS Sunday Morning\nCan I ask you a question just because you know you follow what happens to markets when they're sell off some big moves hire at what point do you believe the industry has to contend with its own and things yeah so\nI ... well they do they do every day but there's points where it gets excess it's sort of like we are our study didn't catharsis in our weight loss study than you for yet another asymmetrical\nCatharsis says a lot more weight or more velocity the the first to rebut of catharsis is uglier than the first two rivers of euphoria but nevertheless yeah you get all ... up and\nYou know where you go I can tell you I'll give you one example\nI the clearest memories of sitting in a busy famed bistro like restaurant uncommon haven't Boston a million years ago\nAnd I just sat there and listened to the roar of optimism\nDid one on all the statistics put you somehow lost the game that's that Tim Murphy football what happened\nWell I think I think he's exactly right and I think that's why the are the\nStatistics are for you know what is true but a bit of an anomaly statistically you know

P. Morgan Chase Wells Fargo Citigroup all those shares are higher\nAnd then what you may be seeing as much as anything is sort of the the flip side of the last couple of days that I say that because you know you look at a technical indicator called the Tour de moving average which gives you some sense of what the markets trying has been\nYou know we saw the U.S and the five hundred fall below that average for the first time in about six months and you look at where the index is today and it's just above that readings so a bit of a of a report\nOn it saying it perhaps are we are we blaming the computers right now is that what's going on people are saying look at these tactical indicators and the computers are the ones that are selling low and buying high at\nThe very least it as something that you can use to figure out whether stocks or cheap by historical standards and I say that because\nYou look at this moving average and it's just been steadily rising over time and that trend do you have to figure at least for the moment it's still intact\nAnd so you know that you're thinking than what we've seen in the last couple of days provides an opportunity and I will tell you about another technical indicator from yesterday it's called the tick index it's based on New York stock exchange listed shares\nAnd it got to its lowest reading since the flash crash back in twenty ten so you basically had investors throwing out pretty much everything\nAnd that's unusual so people look for that situation to reverse itself and we have seen that to some extent but with today's recovery\nLet me just give you this ah information at this comes from J. P. Morgan Chase they did a study looking at the various types of trading stocks\nAbout ten percent of total trading volume in stocks is done on what they described as a fundamental discretionary basis meaning some person is making a decision sixty percent of trading\nAnd stop volume in ... in stocks is passive or want to invest in quantitative investing that ...\nPercent is there any way to get a sense of on high volatility days whether that ratio shifts more toward the passive and the quantitative trading strategies\nI Do not know the answer to that what I can tell you is that day before yesterday we traded I think somewhere around Eighteen and a half billion\nShares that was not as high as we had previously hit this year I think we traded over twenty billion shares twice\nYeah I'm looking at eleven and a half billion in NY\nNYU and the way I Want to start adding them all the ... yeah but right but you see what I mean in other words it's about trying to find out how much money will move a stock a certain percentage either up\nOr down in price and at least according to this analysis sixty percent of all that trading and trading you know the price at the margin is set by that ... you know buy and sell moment sixty percent as automated\nRight and where that comes into play as who's really setting the price of the star right because\nYou know if when you talk about passing investing that's exchange traded funds it's neutral bonds that are tracking indexes and so the buying and selling their is based on perhaps people getting into or out of out of the last couple of days presumably more than anything else\nA safe trip funds UPS so you know you have that sort of mechanism going on now it's not like you know the picture of the two of the day moving average is necessarily going to influence that\nKind of training when you think about quantitative trading do basically running data and figuring out you know whether to buy or sell based on that you write as these indicators that come into\nPlay and I and I just want to offer a footnote I'm not describing this as being high frequency trading high frequency trading is a subset of the Koran and pass some strategies and some estimates are that high frequency trading is about fifty percent of total\nWell I Know that a Bridgewater actually came out and said that they have not been trading active land there well known quantitative a firms so you know just to sort of at a fight that point\nQuantitative and high frequency or not the same thing I wanted to raise the point where some of the flows data that we got overnight\nThere was seven ... seven billion dollars with John from corporate bond funds is according to a PS are tied to lay the banks America and this was a record one week out flow from that credit uh funds and I find that's really interesting 'cause he did not see a commensurate outflow from stocks funds even though\nThe volatility with much more pronounced they're to me this is important they sort of indicates that either a credit is no longer leading\nCredit traders and credit investors are following the equity markets or they see some issue that perhaps equity markets will have to register further down the line\nIt may just be as simple performance issue I'm looking at the ice shares core us aggregate bond ATF one of the more active ah exchange traded funds in that area that took her as a G G\nI mean this is a a fund that has not done well this year just looking at where it's been yeah lower by as much as it about four and a half percent so\nBy as much as it about four and a half percent so if you're not looking for bonds to give you a losses and that's what's been happening here you know there's the concern about what's happening with deals that you don't earn a whole lot\nBurning corporate bonds relative to treasuries and so there there are a lot of reasons to zone underlined or what we're seeing in bonds relative to stocks\nTables and thank you so much

from our uh by by phone and Shannon I'm is anybody at the White House in the administration trying to walk this back\n[noise] uh no not at all um I mean it's something that the president said a couple of times and now he\nUm ... for doing a rally earlier this week on Wednesday came over to reporters hum to someone on prompted we asked about the stock market and that's when he um decided to go into the attack on the fed [laughter] so it was a deliberate intentional and then he repeated the remarks the next day\nSenate if anything does this make the fed may be pushed back a little\n[laughter] well I mean traditionally the fact that they are very ... ... you know I get a political you could say it's not known for responding but this is sort of a test that the institutions never been under and so I thought there could be any sort of response um you know at one point\nThe president seemed to suggest that he wasn't going to fire Powell hum button he can so you know raising the question of\nWell what control does he have and and and in some cases where he doesn't have control over a situation like\nWe've seen with the attorney general me could fire but politically it would harm him you know if he can't remove someone who doesn't have control over an institution a you know Robert mines and other example then he gets a tax them repeatedly so that could be a pattern that we see play out here as well\nBut what are the politics of the president's attacks on the fed\n[noise] well I mean there is in ... in his base that day you know the anti establishment\nType hum wing ... you know that we would like to see the fat abolished they'd like to see the IRS abolished in this very sort of libertarian\nI'm part of his base that has been a talking point that's been under the surface for they they don't trust the fat they don't think you know it ... it should be um you know they should have any role in government or monetary policy\nSo I I mean it could potentially the plane to that wing hum but also it provided a good explanation for the the big huge stock market drop we saw that day and instead of\nUm attributing that too um his policies on trade concern about those issues um or other markets structural issues he chose the fat as an excuse for why the stock market going down\nSince this presidential pressure began a has driven Powell or or any other policymaker had anything directly to say about what the president said\nNo not really I mean certainly again and the feds an organization that kept me going that way and that much to politics so for the most part they've been staying out of and\nWant to talk about your story about Donald Trump junior hitting the campaign trail this election season tell us about that\nHe has become a very powerful circuit out there for Republicans hum while he is controversial and um you know draws a lot of criticism from\nSo and um you know draws a lot of criticism from Democrats from a very moderate from now on the members of the Republican Party run\nA he is a big attraction I he's raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for candidates and some of the tightest races out there\nUh for example he was just in Texas a campaign for Ted Cruz rated five events in one day and raised almost half a million dollars for him and he he brings that sort of star power that few people in the Republican Party other than the president and arguably the vice president also have\nThat can really draw out Trump's base of supporters and try and get them energized about this election which for many Republicans isn't energizing are are motivating them as much as it is Democrats\nVery quickly as he'd been able to not only energize the base but the brought in more money\nWell he certainly had a I mean just the tally that we were able to put together came up that he had three at least a million dollars since June a for Republican candidates and um you know and the big scheme of a campaign dollars that's not an enormous amount but for one person to raise\nA that is and especially and some of these tight races um where there is a lot of democratic energy or he is important tool to help offset are just sort of counter that fundraiser that's happening on the Democratic side\n... White House reporter thank you for your time so many of them\n... calls you power in law the SEC pump the brakes on a White House push for fewer earnings reports but first let's go to Nancy alliance for ... world than national news NC\nI'm In the short answer is no it doesn't the ... group and the market that has followed the least are the smaller companies\nAnd so it is up on their reporting requirements then you may will be allowed them to um go down certain path\nAccording to estimates from\nThe Bloomberg beat the ... the last sentence again\nYes I'm Sorry so that it could allow them to go down a path hum of not disclosing issues in the company that they shouldn't and so I mean there's a great deal of solicitor snus for smaller companies\nBut when you're talking about disclosure I Wonder whether we should have a different strain large and small companies it is a burden on companies but disclosure is what makes the markets wrong\nAnd makes the U.S capital markets among the best in the world so I'm not sure it's a good idea to cut back on disclosure\nOne of the reasons people said they should cut back on disclosing is that the quarterly reporting undermines long term planning and in fact Clinton touched on that\nUh in his comments afterwards do you see that connection between quarterly reporting in long term planning disconnect rather\nWell ... it's a little bit like the great pumpkin and the old peanut series that you keep looking forward management complains about short term ism but then\nCorporate management is also the group that is fostering the short term is um when they put out\nA quarterly estimates here's what we expect to make ... here for this core or for next year now in part they're feeding the base this is what the analysts want\nBut also to that you don't have to manage your company for short term is ... most investors are in the market either for the long term or what we see with the high frequency trading firms\nThey couldn't care less about next quarter numbers they want to see what's going to happen in the next day or two and so this idea somehow that management is being dictated to by the markets I I really think is a a\nA misunderstanding but it does let them complain about something and they can always point to someone else and say see it's all therefore fault not our fault\nThey're also providing more than the FCC requires them to\nCertainly and ... you you don't have to give estimates um and I you know everybody points to Warren Buffett as the the ultimate long term investor\nWarren Buffett says here's our bottom line look at our asset value um when you see it go up we are doing well when you see it go down we're probably not doing well but live with it and should companies get away from giving quarterly estimates that that wouldn't be a bad thing although the analyst won't like it but\nYou know sometimes you just have to go forward and say we're the best people are running this company and\nIf you don't like us either sell the stock or throw us out\nHere last month for the first time the FCC announced a penalty against five companies that failed to have an auditor review their quarterly financial results would be the SEC doubling down on the concept of quarterly results or was this just a coincidence\nI don't know if it's a coincidence\nIt's just a coincidence I don't know if it's a coincidence but it is\nSending a message that the natural result in in the quarterly financial statements which are not ordered it only the annual financial statements are but you do want your auditors looking at them because\nThese are the numbers that every one is supposed to rely on trust now I Know companies will some times put up their own metrics or say well look how well we're doing\nBut when you go back and look at the financial statements that is telling you important things like cash flow and whether you ever rising expenses\nAnd so I think that message the FCC is trying to send their is don't play fast and loose with the most important set of numbers that are out there in the market this is what analysts have to rely on investors have to rely on\nSo the or is this the last we'll hear of this for a while or do you see it rearing its head again\nOh we'll come back if nothing else we know the president will tweet um and if someone gets his ear like hum as reported I think in the wall Street Journal the former CEO of Pepsi said well we don't like this quarterly reporting and so he can put something out there is\nA it it will come back we might well see some exemptions for smaller companies whether that's a good idea or not is a different issue but I I don't think the idea is dead but\nWe're not going to see major changes here this is what companies are used to do I think they're going to continue to do with\nThank you Peter ...

Dave stocks editor at Bloomberg\nSo Joe we were talking just before we came on the air a little bit more ... more momentum it feels like today what are you looking at\nYeah absolutely I think if you look at what really got crushed for between October first which was the pig\nAnd earlier this week it was those momentum stocks where's those stocks that hedge funds loved to own\nAnd they outperform yesterday and they're holding up well today's today's been kind of ... so it's not like it's been that great we started off really strong than where red very briefly on the U.S in pay and we bounced back a little bit but the leaders once again are some of these momentum\nHedge fund darling and I just sort of like\nHave a few that I watch it any given time sales force dot com I'm really got clobbered earlier on them I'm up three and a half percent today that's often ties to be clear as much more earlier but it's clear also what's leading the way and people are sort of buying back some of those momentum names\nRight S. and P. as a four tenths of one percent but the NASDAQ up over a one percent and I I Would imagine a lot of those names jogging about sales force included are are are more tech heavy right\nAnd I was just the empty un ATF the momentum stocks Egypt or up one point three percent\nTarget date come on in here what are you looking at today says that much calmer market although as Joe said bouncing around a little bit on the U.S and pay\nFor those financial stocks and the ... between the largest ah financial companies and those regional banks you were mentioning\nReally does stand out though I'll say that even if you look at a J. P. Morgan Wells Fargo city group ah they really had their ah best performance of the day early on I mean J. P. Morgan now lower by one point eight percent\nCitigroup Wells Fargo barely hanging on the games so it's not like the reception that greeted their third quarter results when they came out as really lasted\nSo what's more striking is what happened with PNC financial now down about six and a half percent and how other regional banks of the gun along for the ride you look at the worst performers and he has to be five hundred\nIs the citizens financial hired and bank shares key court regents financial US Bank Corp zions bank or all down more than three percent wow it's a lot\nYou know yesterday it was funny we were talking a lot about a currency seven does emerging market out there and see that we're doing really really well\nI look today doesn't look as crazy as well yesterday you still have the south African Rand in there but we didn't have the Turkish lira or the ... time pay sound something the other things I think standouts even currencies we've really been focused on the equities so far\nSo really interesting dynamic that I hadn't realized as I hadn't really thought of yesterday until we talked about on TV\nThose EM currencies again yesterday the big ones one thing all those countries had in common big oil importer weakness late late yeah an oil strength of course a exacerbate their current account deficits\nAnd so when you get the weakness that is sort of a cue to pile back into turkey and South Africa and India that is the ... in Argentina of course none of them have much oil all have to import a lot of oil down modestly again today to kind of like the perfect socks for them if you get a little bit of a balance and risk appetite\nBut without a bouncing oil\nThen you can sort of the green light to buy something like the south African Rand\nAnd the lira obviously people looking at today on the news of the Turkish has started sorry the U.S tests are being released by Turkish authorities after being convicted but that are clearly seen as a positive development politically economically and from a currency market perspective said Dave just going back to earnings for a second\nAs you look out um\nDo we have any sense as effectively one day and what sort of earnings season this is going to be\nWell I mean one thing you can say is that the track record of ... five hundred companies in beating and was sororities estimates is already kind of setting up here\nUh latest numbers indicate that people are looking for a twenty percent increase in in profit and that includes actual results along with estimates for the companies that have come out\nYou go back to the end of September that was Nineteen and a half percent not a surprise to see that happen at least the way things go in the past five years now to talk about that more next hour with my charge of the day I Love\nHow you set up your chart of the day for the\nMoment at least you can say that the trend is intact\nOf companies coming out ahead of projections even with the concerns that are around about raw material costs in labor costs and transportation costs in Paris concerns me those issues are going to be out there but so far they have not to sort of deterred uh companies from coming out ahead of estimates\nDave I Wonder if you talk to send me are traders instructions on the desk one of the things that I was thinking about is it the friday and are you comfortable holding on to some of the Sox given the volatility that we've been seen as we head into the weekend\nAnd I wonder for starting to stay a little bit of a small pulled back as people maybe starts clubs out on position\nThere is that I mean certainly with all the earnings coming on something like fifty four companies in the U.S and five hundred next week a bank of America Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley noble among them\nYou know there's a lot to look forward to and perhaps that's a reason to back away one day that was interesting earlier today a Marco ... who runs macro quiet him into rivers research at J. P. Morgan\nHe referred to systematic selling\nResearch at J. P. Morgan he referred to systematic selling done by a quantitative investors and so on his be most of that done\nWe'll see if it's right and it may well be playing into sort of the renewed a straight that we're seeing in stocks in the last couple of hours or so a lot to look forward to hear\nA lot to look for to indeed we'll look forward to hearing more from you Dave Wilson coming up with your charge of the day which you mentioned a at that is at the bottom of the next hour job wise though we're going to send you off to would you miss coming up at four pm Wall Street time in the meantime let's get\nA check on world and national headlines with Nancy lines down in our Ninety nine one newsroom in D.C and Thanks Jason\nI'm Flora was still a war worry for the facts\nBut overall I Would say that they're well position for the fourth quarter a pre storm a revolt and into two thousand Nineteen\nParticularly a three way too low and grow flown quality or additionally a rebound in the capital markets are backing abhor towards week uh were kept the performance and um after a worker first half of the year\nI Wanna get into more of the lung cross and alone quality quickly can can you explain for us a little bit sort of why we're seeing\nThe share price reaction today is it because things are okay and they are and but but they're not good enough I mean why are we seen sort of some of that declines even know like you said things are okay\nSo if we bring the drivers to a broader measure you know top on grow for or net revenue for single digit\nTop what do they I don't think any adults is significantly racing they're hurting so much for free um you know so again there was really nothing to get too excited about the bank\nHas relate to that they're also a stock will not clean Provo return vehicle they won't be the next two years and what I mean by that is they're very significant to grow by that happening\nBut an investor cannot look at the like the utility or comfort or staple and say I'm getting a two and a half three percent you know I'm an\nActress getting there after ten years kind of going the way back from natural crisis\nSo Arnold come on in here because one of the other elements we want to make sure we touch on is the regional banks and specifically PNC was the name that everybody was looking at a this morning stock getting hit pretty hard what's underneath that\nUh well I think you know it's it's got a really high quality problem where um you know they trade at a very high multiple on the equity side kind of close to the two times tangible book\nI think there's a lot of expectations going in and uh and I think the two places where there are concerns are are\nA one expenses and two is alone grows so let's talk about one gross um [noise]\nYou know any bank can hit their long gross numbers if they can you know ... you know a lower their standards and just extend loans to whoever but\nYou know he's really known as as the one who's really cautious you know that they have their metrics that they need to hit or or you know ... to make a loan so um you know they said competition has increased um and and so basically they can you know slightly shy of\nWhat people were expecting on on loan growth\nAnd you know we talk about some of the competition aspect later but then on the expense side and expense side as well they they said hey you know there were a little bit over what people expected but\nYou know they argue hey you want us to stop investing in digital you want us to stop investing in cyber and we can do that for a quarter to but you know eventually down the line\nWho are going to get killed so you know for me looking at it holistically hum you know from the credit side or the credit stories actually really clean across the board writing and all these things coming in with a ... maybe\nYou know slightly lower than expected alone gross mistrust you more on the side which which is what the regional banks are are known for you know for some consumer and so that's why I think you know the whole you know a TV W you know regional bank index which is more regional thing is is getting hit you know\nYeah it's interesting I was I Can't they can't be deli regional index and then a\n... just sort of bank index and they're both off on and on my face this year to date about seven percent can add is there anything that stands out to you as we talk about long growth inside of the quality of loans\nI'm being that you see as really prudent in terms of not sacrificing the quality of loans just in order to growl that really being prudent for when the credit cycle turn\nOn the results today I Would I'm Morgan clearly have put quality in some cases sacrificing grow\n'em there isn't that the stress and the story of the portfolio from the commercial industrial won't portfolio author or so there's not any contagion from global rough about Seventy five percent revenue project Morgan\nCome from Europe and North America

the performer\nThe first woman says those stupid F ing white people they're going to know how it feels they deserve this wait until later this is about a half hour before the shooting begins the second woman like shooting fish in a barrel are you getting this baby I love you know the woman that says are you getting was babies standing with her fun\nLive streaming from the back of the concert what's going on\nNow while that is not conclusive proof it's decidedly suspicious and has not been followed up on a couple of other things that that that came out of that and one of 'em want to go to next since we're kind of on the timeline issue so this takes place\nTwenty one twenty nine twenty PM ah and now\nDuring that period there is no information as to what\nStephen Paddock the shooter was doing in that room now he was already located in the room from\nFrom where the shooting took place at three two one three five\nAnd three two one two three four of the two rooms that he used any building up his barricades nowadays for Iraq he's clearly in the final stages of preparing to start shooting\nSo at Twenty one thirty six oh nine thirty six which is what sixteen minutes or so after this bail 'em hey incident he throws the dead ball now the salt kept track of by the hotel so they see when rooms or access to win the dead both has thrown on their on their inhouse computers are so we got the door access security broke I exactly right\nSo at Twenty one thirty six he throws the dead both to three two one three five now this is very important\nTen minutes go by in the middle of those ten minutes to construct against\nAs we've discussed before there was these were connecting rooms three two one through five and three two and three or four were connecting with an interior door\nSo that once you fight or was not opened precisely ten minutes later the dead boat was thrown to one tree for\nSo for that from the inside so that is absolutely conclusive proof of with no doubt whatsoever because one two three five three she wants to be ... I was not opened again\nThat interior door was used to throw the dead bolt on one tree for war there was a second person in there to do it there is no other way so that interior door\nFast forward a half hour or so after the shooting ... dead the police breached the door to three two one three five\n... dead body evade themselves the police could not get into one three poor they tried to get through the door couldn't do it and had to breach the door so that they can enter one tree for\nDead ... on the passage door between the two rooms was dead bolted from the one three four side now we know that\nPrior to the shooting that door either had to be open so that bad it can go through in lock the one three or four door to the hallway\nOr somebody else was in that room it has to be one of the two there is no other way that has to be investigated following up on ... in that room to another interesting point out of all of that to computers were found\nOne of those computers had a a a a hard drive missing that that was removed from it well\nWhy would you bring a laptop to the room to do is shooting that already had\nThat hard drive removed that doesn't make sense so it's logical but that was removed at the time and somebody took it away\nBut that I mean I it's hard to prove things like that but it's interesting little side as\nWell if I mean if if he knew that he was going to conduct they attacked obviously he was willing to give himself up so why try to protect himself if he knew he was doing\nExactly it just makes no sense for us to have played out that way so there's a lot of questions I mean to make the statement in the police report that there's no evidence is a false with there's clearly evidence and and the evidence wasn't followed up on\nAnd let me come back to one other point that we've discussed previously and that's Bryan Hodges these strikes and that in the several hours following this the mass shooting\nClaimed to have been in room three two one two three four\nAnd this is by a a multiple social media posts that were made then following up on that because of those posts a he was interviewed numerous times on mostly Australia and a media and during those interviews claimed that he was in that room correct\nThat had been his radio and television interviews that he later did more industrial you\nDown interesting point out of all that he claims to be have been in room ... three two months before\nIn room three to one report or another pair of gloves found these were initially reported in the in the initial police report but we're not reported on that's been dropped out of the final police report ... interesting aspect not panic himself when his body was found had gloves on\nAnd so what were those second pair of gloves doing and they weren't brand new gloves unused that are like smashed down from packing he's er gloves that had hands in them and then we are dropped on the bed and room one one\nThree two one three for ... interesting interesting but certainly evidence of a second person being there I don't see how you describe that as any other way than the evidence isn't conclusive no but you start stacking these things up and there's a lot of questions that are not answered [noise]\nPassed this mass shooting with fifty dead people and over a hundred wounded according to the final police are still the largest\nMass shooting in American history ever and obviously the families of all those who lost lost loved ones and as I\nWant some kind of closure and wants some answers and his report in giving them very much it is\nNot giving them what they need this in the closure cannot take place until all these things you and I are talking about a run down another final area out of all of this it's kind of this kind of interesting on this is how the police to source some of the information that's come out that they they they can identify a motive\nAnd that they don't think it's political but two things I Want to say about that one [noise]\nPanic started buying all these guns that he used in the shooting when Trump was elected\nAnd over the eight months or so put all of this arsenal together was used during the shooting an interesting quirk of timing that that is not given any significance to\nThe end the concert itself to was widely regarded as as a country it was a country western a concert that was widely regarded as being full of Trump supporters whether that's true or not doesn't matter it was\nA concert that was widely regarded as being full of Trump supporters whether that's true or not doesn't matter it was still regarded that way and a very reasonable for ... to regard is it that way as well so\nThis source that says that that\nSteven panic was not political is his girlfriend Mary Lou Danley match the source now the police referenced his family members but all of them had been strange for men for mostly for more than a decade so they didn't know and set in their reports they didn't know so the source of the information saying he was non political was only Mary Lou Dan Rather was\nWidely believed to be the more radical leftist up to now now they're very interesting point about merely Danley we've talked about Brian Hodges\nAnd how he claimed to be in the room the shooter's room treat you once before he was at least on that floor as a guest and his own right and we're supposed to have been checked into three two one two nine which three to designate floor one indicates the hallway and then his room was to nine and it was three or four three plot\nSo he was very near where the shooting took place why would he have not been question just anyway but he was not having been somebody supposedly on that floor\nAnd then later to claim to have been in the room so Brian Hodges is just strictly in\nBryan Hodges claim in his own information talking about himself he claimed at one time to work in a casino called the star casinos star gold coast casino which is located a gold ...\nNow very interesting Mary Lou Danley who's been widely reported to have also been a dealer at the casino\nAlso said about herself that she previously worked and the star gold coast casino\nNow I Do to flee looked up to ... the star Gulf Coast casino and it's in an area of the strip cocoa coast and there is precisely one casino there and that's the stark casino there are no there are other casinos but how far away and things like that but that's the only casino in that location now for Brian Hodges and murder damning both claimed to work there in the same period of time\nThey would have known each other it's a small family of dealers that are there and they all know each other from their shifts and so on it would have been very difficult for them not to the least known each other by sight\nAnd then later interesting Brian ... shows up were married ... Danley is now dating a PC than panic so that's never been investigated either how can even to this day we be it's a situation where Ryan Hodges has not been questioned by authorities now how can that be\nHe's just there's just too many links to the shooting\nFor him not to be questioned Brad thank you so much for coming in today thank you so much for giving us the sort of one year update or as far as the anniversary goes and I I certainly appreciate their work appreciate said and I'm hopefully that as we drive towards the truth\nOn this it'll lead to closure for those that were affected by this horrific tragedy I pray that takes place thanks so much thank\nA new poll is addressing that it it's a very close race between Georgia gubernatorial candidates Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams W.
