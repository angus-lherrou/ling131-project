because of this ... because as I was I I Would have said yes there is a lot going on a lot to get to want to grab a phone call or two off the top here um and then we've got the just the stories continue to come in about how\nYou do you think Jerry that people in\nThe news media didn't pay attention to the moving of our embassy to Jerusalem in Israel should only be new yes because they're actually what they do they keep on interviewing Israeli people\nYou know dignitaries of sorts and rabbis and they think that they're going to talk badly about Donald Trump President Trump is the one that move the embassy to the rightful capital of Israel, Why why do they think that Israel doesn't like Donald Trump what are they stupid\nI don't know why you're doing that does that make sense to you would you think that it's not really is really has a problem with Donald Trump I I don't I never thought that\nJust doesn't make any sense actually now I I thought they had a brain but then again maybe I was wrong it actually improving but I was wrong and so it's a ... go ahead\nI was gonna say you know I was really interested in the mainstream media especially after the synagogue shooting in how they were going to a\nBrain that I guess and I heard in reports that this guy was a big anti Trump guy he was not a fan whatsoever I was watching ABC or when the last two days and not one time that I hear them say that\nSo they held a decision because of the second amendment said that people have the right to protect their homes to themselves and their stuff they have that right inherently because of the protections and the second amendment without the second amendment in Washington DC a human being still could not own a gun to they're going to have actually put together\nIn their houses keep that in mind you saying that the second member means nothing I'm here to tell you it means everything if it meant nothing we wouldn't be having his argument\nWell that's the thing we were arguing over over the crowd is the government's left us I mean they they left the crowd is we're over here arguing\nOver now we're not we're not even when I thought I'd powerless and I've got three handguns I've got an A R Fifteen I don't have crumbs I have guns that can really stop somebody from doing something bad to my family and to me\nI cannot development well it\nDepends on on how much of it depends on how much of the government are they doing it ... it depends on how much the government is doing it how much that government uprising and tyranny is really doing and if people like you and me and our entire communities rose up of course it would mean something read the whole idea where to start with getting rid of the second amendment\nActually made the point moved from the beginning but I wanted to have the discussion with you or you haven't gotten any\nWhere it would be very honest with you\nWell no I I appreciate you let me on the air to talk about it because I mean I don't think enough people don't understand how the second amendment isn't that much power and that the\nAnd the second time it actually ... about the art and art art that they're actually wrong\nAnd has a lot of power I just give you a prime example of elder decision but you did but you chose not to listen to Tony appreciates let's do it again I Do appreciate you wanted to mix it up I like that\nBut the whole idea that it doesn't mean anything is wrong I think his point was the government has so much overwhelming force it doesn't matter and I hear what he's saying and I hear where he's coming from I'm not going to buy that because there were three hundred twenty million of us\nOkay and and there's a government that's pretty big but it's about two and a half million people\nAre and when you break down what the armed forces are and I think a lot of people in the armed forces would leave the armed forces if the government ever said go kill all the people take their guns um but we we certainly would have a fighting chance because of the second amendment open ever comes to that I don't see that happening but the argument that it doesn't mean that you're going to the shooter doesn't ring true for me it\nEight nine four one ...

D. M. I. in very good art Rick talked to me\nWell I'd like to speak a little bit about the last guy the guy is in the exactly what I was calling about Nash the spirit of the second amendment as was ... by our founders back in the game was must get your hand grenades people leave that part out\nTo spirit was that the average everyday citizen would have the foot soldier could carry into combat that ties directly into us keeping ourselves from having a over ... radical government\nWell I think that's also that's also an incident Scalia said in his ruling he said um that if you are I I've seen them in several interviews of course before he passed but he said the way I see the second amendment is if you can carry it\nIf you can keep it and you can hold it you can bury it then it's covered by the second amendment so when people say tanks and ... teams everything else they're not they're not talking to a second language\nThat's absolutely true of foot soldiers can pack it on the battlefield the average everyday citizens can't possess that includes night vision that includes body armor illness the list goes on the shoulder can have it the average everyday citizen can possess the bottom line\nDie brother I appreciate your legs Edmund ... see a a sandwich Edmund\nWell it sounded like at men okay shrimp did had been written there you go I don't imagine into Eddie\nProbably just don't even though you're saying Edmund it's a editing nine for one pack Joe ... outcome terrible habit migrant story we come back with Joe ... show Steyer guilty ... stay with him on\nAdd to that the fact that a lot of these migrants are not all of them had been offered refugee status in Mexico they haven't been offered refugee status and the Mexican presidents like offering the sort of welfare and free crap jobs and they're like\nYeah yeah yeah\nWe're just gonna keep on going so it's not about that I mean that that exposed a lot of what's really happening here when they said no no thank you there's not really about just a better life not really about a job is not really about getting some food and getting a a better place for your family you know this is about getting here\nThat's what this is about and that really exposed them or editing nine for one pack Joe ... going to go to the phone lines going to be laundry and Kermit in Missouri hermit what's going on\nA ... living grain or are you going to go\nBut I Can't answer because she's still my line old am I supposed\nTo say [laughter] I can use that one beer short time listener film without it a few months ago cool what's going on\nAbout talking about the second amendment or the last guy was spot on where we need to be carrying you know weapons comparable to military style weapons because you can't defend yourself against the military with the shooter or one round and magazine and\nPeople have died at the fact that we didn't get invaded after Pearl Harbor because our society with armed or are they\nTalked about invading the U. S. and their general advised not to because they said they're the Bush or gun behind every Bush yeah\nThat's absolutely true why do we keep saying the shooter can you in the last caller stopped seeing the shooter my ... shooters or a good what else\nI I said that because of him and that's what I'm saying I Know if we're if we're limited to one round at our magazine or two shot there was no way we can defend ourselves and gets or or adversaries or our government right\nSo that is the reason why we need to have large caliber weapons and magazines comfortable to the military\nI Gotcha I hear you and I appreciate you I'm All right let me go back at it and say hello and welcome to a line for its Michael in Mississippi Michael what's up\nOn good love your show bank you\nAre in a fight the last caller that was all talking about doing away with the second amendment yeah\nI'm a retired at thirty nine years ... ... ... and they take that away from us and our tried to take it away I'm right like all say a civil war right here mess in the United states\nWell I I Would never be successful to take it away and it was ... it sounds like there's a big push to do it but it's a it's a very small minority of people I was just going anywhere man\nOr you know a while back somebody I think it was all ... or ... was asked the guy I bail where there's a clause in a second man she was all use that to take the hand guns are way\nYes you can't put a clause of the second amendment a list of states all agree to change the constitution and that wasn't going to happen\nFast right and uh\nOh the more you know I Believe if if tall voted for Trump I Believe in you know and uh if ... ... ... natural powers and\nArrest everybody with at had anything to do with uranium on\nI think that would shut the whole life down\nOh I think I Would just I remember just riled them up even more to be honest with you if he goes after the Clintons now which I think you would be the the OJ should but if he goes after the Clintons right now\nBut it'd be forget it I mean that you're going to see an uprising here like we haven't seen the very long time you're already seeing it because the media is freaking out but if he wants to bring indictments and they have people like did the rights I'm all for it but this is going to be some elongated investigation\nHe's going to be doing himself but he favors now I don't want her to get away scot free I Want that entire thing to be exposed but um I I I don't know the\nThe last thing you want to see him do it started to lose my executive powers and go after this thing when he was doing so well in all of his other duties we don't want to give them something to focus on to be honest with you on the left I I actually was Michael I appreciate your service I really do appreciate what you had to say but ... you know investigation after ... after\nNow we're gonna impeach every body now are going to do it enough\nLet's take away the BS for a second and realize how successful this guy who's been in fewer than two years in under two years with this guy who's done is startling\nWouldn't get new unemployment numbers this Friday but you can own numbers are crazy three and a half percent GDP four point two percent you know the the previous quarter I mean that's nuts\nThat's unbelievable unless they're going to use a okay well the focus of his presidency wasn't investigating shouldn't do this no we need to rise above that and say look at how great he is doing look at how what are standing in the world look with our economy is doing\nI think that's the smart play here it's like when people used to call in because they wanted to give me the reasons why they believed to bedrock Obama was born in Kenya and I'd stop them and I'd say stop it\nI don't know where he was born you don't know where he was born gotta burst says Hawaii then I got another ... says Hawaii that people who say they were witnesses of it and and he's the president so let's not\nBut people who say they were witnesses of it and and he is the president so let's not hang our hat on vat\nLet's focus on what he's doing in the job and his job performance was so bad\nThat it was easy to talk about what it was he wasn't doing for this country\nYou would you you could focus on this fantasy about him not being born here or or\n... dispersed stimulus forging numbers stimulated the other thing and all that other crap or you can charities and the job it's our job to make sure people understand how bad he is at this\nAnd that's what I was important people to do so I'm not here to say get away with uranium one I'm not here to say get away with wrongdoing and and horrible things what I'm saying is you want to do that in the background and not publicize it maybe\nBut in the foreground in the forefront we must keep and the president must keep\nPromoting the positive things that are happening and by the way if negative things start happening all report them here but so far so good when it comes to the economy when it comes to national is a which is a good thing when it comes to our standing in the world when it comes to trade nothing but good so far

shooter at the ... attack in Kandahar where did he come from does this look like an al ... trained outfit or not Taliban ... outfit or and is there a difference good evening to\nJohn yet you're rushing out of it and the Taliban operate and we believe they trained gather we know they fight together on the battlefield that killed her\nArgument here in southern Afghanistan certainly in Kandahar Province\nHis argument for the most powerful figure in southern Afghanistan certainly in Kandahar Province a key provinces in the country the pace of the Taliban\nSo uh what the Taliban did was they infiltrated this assassinate he's known as ... to China and he became a bodyguard for the governor of Kandahar who was also seriously wounded in this attack\nAnd a vehicle trade him and he said the Taliban released a video of him speaking\nOf talking you know without fighting the Afghan government and within interspersed in this video is him training at a Taliban training camp and as your listeners know we talk about these Taliban camps all the time they're often ridiculed by some saying you know the training is Mickey Mouse or whatnot but when we\nYou know when you have an attack of this level of sophistication that are almost killed general Miller that wounded a senior general Gerald being the commander of resolute forces or U.S forces in Afghanistan\nAnd you know we we can't dismiss what we what we see on these videotapes of the Taliban are preparing for the U.S departure and they're going to go at the Afghan government full tilt when the U.S goes\nThe logic of this attack bill is that it could have gone forward and any moment and that they chose the Taliban chose to launch the attack when these senior American officer was president I guess at that point that guarantees that it makes it into a global news\nAbsolutely so yes I mean I I Would guess that the journalistic who's the chief of police in Kandahar he probably was one of the two prime targets but

type of job they're doing is even a minute with Paul DeMarco\n\nI'm John ... del Rosario and Tom just some of the foundation for the defense of democracy they are senior fellows\nThey keep the long war journal which is an excellent way to watch the transformation of Afghanistan in the coming months and years\nThe U.S has been bogged down in a combat that is very difficult to summarize since the attack on New York and Washington within a month but here we are asking ourselves how is the Taliban doing as it advances district after district bill you have a a report\nThat half the Afghan population lives in districts that are no longer in government control\nThat he is a way of talking about how ineffective the central government is in ... uh in alliance with the U.S and our allies are partners they're a articulate a little more what does that mean they're outside of government control what does it mean for their lives and for the future good evening again\nJohn first break down the numbers I mean we we estimate that nine percent\nOf the population live in areas that are controlled by the Taliban and another forty one percent are living in areas there at\nA certain percentage is controlled by the Taliban is controlled by the government these are typically the districts that where most of the fighting is where the Taliban and\nThe Afghan military or going\nWhat would it be like for that we want to be you want to be very clear we can't say that the Taliban in contested area that that is when we kind of consider a no go zone\nYou know in a contest area that that is\nWe kind of consider a no go zone 'em again this is\nThis will be the most difficult probably even more difficult than in ... that are in areas under Taliban control um areas under Taliban control you're going to get their ... to you know whipping and you know they're they're all the craziness they're Islamic law that we've seen over the last several decades\nI'm In the areas that are contested\nUm you know you could be living in a town in in a contest that area that may be under government control or influence and the next town over as hell is Alvin in troll there's often a lot of fighting in between these areas you're ... if you were living in one of those areas that might be government control you're fearful that the Taliban could be coming next\nThe next day that the Taliban are coming to tax you that the Taliban to come to do all of those horrible things that the Taliban does and you know what we're trying to show people here is\nLooked at the situation in Afghanistan is far more dire than the U.S military the U.S government is trying to tell us they are trying to paper over this situation so they got a peace deal with the Taliban but the numbers\nWhen we analyze the situation we can't come to any other any\nLet me underline that bill that President Trump made a speech I Believe it was the spring of Seventeen talking about his commitment to Afghanistan and at that time we believed they were going to extend\nTheir ... extend the deployment of us troops and our allies in Afghanistan does it still look that way given these retreats\nIt it does and what happened is you know the president said we're gonna we're gonna make the Taliban were in a beat them to the negotiating table by eating them into submission to the negotiating table instead were beating them up and running quickly to it was within six months they they basically dropped\nThe idea that we can cause a military defeat the Taliban and just decided to do negotiations um by all the indication droplets out of Afghanistan before the next election\nNext presidential election and I suspect that's what we're going to be and you know I just think if that's the U.S policy we need to be very clear about what is going to happen to Afghanistan when the U.S leaves\nYou have a map long war journal I recommend everybody go to the map you get it right away they break it down into government control contested Taliban control and unconfirmed mobile\nAnd it very much looks like they're surrounding the mountainous center of the country I see them particularly dominating the area around Capitol is that the way to read this man\nYeah that is I mean look the Taliban controlling and test numerous districts in the province just south and east and north of the capital and I said look if the if the if the U.S wants to cut a peace deal with the Taliban\nLet's let's say the Taliban you know decided hey we'll make some agreement as soon as U.S forces are gone the Taliban are going to turn on the Afghan government they said they will share power and I think when you look at the geography if you look at this map and see who holds the upper hand here in Afghanistan\nYes and it's not just around ... certainly dominated around Kandahar which is the main\nUh trade route and also smuggling route from Pakistan and the Baluch area and then all along the Iran border look at that bill all around Iraq all contested by the Taliban as did a lot\nOf effort in the west and even shocking is the north in the areas that you know really should be the former northern alliance strongholds right at the various confess that it's it's very concerning when you look at the end it hasn't changed for the last year was the Afghan military has not been able to be back without\nTom I Want to go back to Iran because we talked about Iran working with the Taliban does that does that leave out al ... or is al ... an agent some ... in some fashion about this around the Taliban relationship\nWell two things real quick John you just picked up on something that's very important which you noticed that the the territory along the Iranian border and part of the explanation for that is that Iran according to multiple pieces of evidence now is actually hosting called on training camps are sending fighters into western Afghanistan and take over that turf\nAnd part of what you've seen these ... these nations that came out last week we were talking about the first segment is that Iran is actually even given the orders of Taliban commanders and some of the in some instances according to the U.S Treasury Department this is very interesting and it and it was amazing development the EU has already see that are trying with the Taliban in these operations\nBut it does involve okay that answer your question because of course the army's closely allied with al ... and then I'll kind of has its own agreement with Iran that allows 'em all kind of fighters to sort of transit Iranian territory they move funds communications\nAnd other sort of vital assistance Ryan territory in a kite is imbedded in the Taliban insurgency so they are also deeply involving\nCentcom becomes is Tom when they put out

I saw that that mean that that sounded like panic garden\nIt it sounds like panic especially because if you did this a year ago you would have a one point five percent transaction feel the black market today that transaction fees five percent five percent John\nThat it had a garden there is no way really the only alternative is for the last of the United states to prop up the Chinese economy has a very time they're stealing technology they're putting in barriers against free trade and blaze\nAnd basically Being American tell us country and they will still continue to put forward threats such as we've heard correct\nYeah I I think so if that is in a situation where you've got an hardline state you know China's moving from authoritarianism to totalitarianism you've got a leader who is in secure who is got great ideas like Mao Saddam\nThere there are no good solutions they're they're innocent nothing that outsiders really can do except to try to contain and bitter apart from that um we are helpless to you know we're ... we're we're just witnesses watching a slow motion and sometimes a quick motion tragedy in China\nOne more detailed garden about these threats from she and why way are they sitting at a tone a scene for everybody else as they speak around the world are we going to see this kind of bellicose tantrum\nFrom every trade representative every diplomat are they all on a leash now does speak poorly of the United states and Europe\nI think that uh the tone in the jumping is set really means that every official is going to be really difficult to foreigners because\nI'm to actually have a nuanced conversation or a friendly conversation with an American or somebody else\nIs very very difficult in these circumstances especially when you also consider that see jumping is tightening down controlling turn away so you put all this together and it it just shows that China is going in directions which are extremely disturbing and the best that we can do is just pay attention to this because if we don't pay attention John\nI'm the worst outcomes will almost certainly occur\nThat is one more question quickly because the rest of the world seem to understand is finally\nI don't think so that is I think we're coming around to a better understanding of China but we are still willfully behind developments internally which are getting worse really by almost the day but certainly by the week\nIs Caitlin ... garden that's who wrote the piece in foreign affairs which I recommend do everybody Caitlin is an associate professor of Caitlin challenging associate professor of security studies at the Edmund a wall school of foreign service at Georgetown\n... essay in foreign affairs is adapted from China into nuclear assessing the risk of Chinese nuclear escalation in a conventional war with the United states\nInternational security spring twenty Seventeen and the short answer is yeah yeah\nNo I Know they will go nuclear\nThey taught they do not have the forces that Russia managed over Seventy years to offset the U.S forces\nThey is an asymmetrical confrontation led by an unstable leadership without legitimacy and a man who's making flat right now against the United states of America and declares himself presidents for life if that doesn't sound like a thriller first got there what does I'm John bachelor with that is McCotter and garden ...\nThe Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government secrets\nBut the United states has master hackers to the best one of the CIA cyber age who defies all notions of what a deadly\nThat's our hackers to the best one of the CIA cyber age who defies all notions of what a deadly spy looks like in fight\nFormer intelligence agent Eric Anderson's page turning new thriller the tables are turned in big power cyberwarfare Eric ... new novel from done books is bite B.

I think it's a split screen election in part because where I think kind of back to where we were at the beginning of summer which is a house that is poised to flip to the Democrats may not but I think it's it's it's sort of headed there on a fan of that is not going to and you have two different battleground Syria with a\nA suburban and next door to the battleground where Indians of Trump or\nAre mixed at best to very poor and voters interested in and making changes for all sorts of reasons ah and then in the Senate you have a very pro Trump Republican battleground bunch of red states where Republicans are poised to not only keep their majority but add to it\nAnd so I think things like the caravan may be a helpful in the Senate races where we know the Kavanaugh episode woke up complacent Republican electorate and got an energizing the caravan of certainly not going to be on helpful\nUm and it may be helpful in some of these races\nCertainly not going to be on helpful um Anna may be helpful and some of these races although I don't know if Republicans need much more help in the Senate races at this point I don't think it's going to\nBe that determinative if at all in the house and I think part of that as they are now so many competing issues\nAre that are helpful to Democrats or helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and then I think they're going to overtake the care of an issue but in part it's just because we have two different battle\nAmish fund the Trump voters and twenty sixteen were not routinely people that the Republican Party counted on

thing about the caravan is about driving out the Trump votes shining that you know on President but I don't know timed for relaxation the country is still in danger and that's why Trump uses such Marshall language even the\nTone that would seem inappropriate after Pittsburgh he's trying to basically say we're still in a war footing which means we have to demand sacrifices from you go vote\nThat is you have a question a general we're talking you're obviously it's a mid term it's a base election both sides want to turn their supporters out are you seeing any single issue that has really swing the independence one way or another\nDavid\nI don't know if we're seeing a single issue I think ultimately Trump is the factor and were trunk can be helpful and John mentioned where he's going to be traveling\nFrom is helping to turn out his base and what we're seeing unlike a year ago is very little separation between the Trump base and the standard Republican base and there's little separation between the Trump based on the Republican incumbent\nTrump didn't always get along with but does at the moment I think in the house it's working against Republicans by and large you just

just so many house districts are competing for because of all this\nAnger and a mixed that has been motivated by a a rejection of Trump but that's what's making it very hard for for Republicans in terms of the house fight John\nYou know the first billionaire president ever elected as apparently encourage lots of other billionaires to go take 'em down a Michael Bloomberg was obviously running for the Democratic nomination won some scallops of all he is dumped I think in the last day or two six million dollars any single house race Dana Rohrabacher is in California\nIs now I think the most expensive house race in the country almost thirty six million dollars spent the amount of money that his poured into this widened the playing field that David mentioned is just astonishing we've never seen a party control Congress\nAnd be so swamped in terms of resources out by the opposition party which is a minority\nOr it's almost as if K Street stressful donors are irrelevant these super PACs are by the way Democrats by the way no longer complaining about Citizens United to drill notice these super PACs and these billionaires are dominating the playing field financially in this election pop the Citizens United is not benefiting the Democrats about the Republicans\nAnd John six million dollars from Bloomberg uh one district\nIn one district because he wants to house that's it\nHe wants credit for turning warehouse he wants to read it for carrying certain districts he wants to establish his bona fide he's as a Democrat\nYou saw him as a Clinton teased us again John today

above\nAnd this was an incident that may be may be will be enough of a warning for people\nThat we have to watch the business that we can't tolerate you know people getting beaten up because they ...

because of this\nWell certainly in Pittsburgh we met with the elected officials the police and others\nNo I mean here in New York I'm Joe I'm all\nRight so I'm saying that you know on the side and every place in NYPD course stepped up its efforts we have a meeting tomorrow where we bring everybody together to address this subject\nThat once and for all we have to make security a priority and while law enforcement everybody has its role and government has to help it's got to start with the community and help every community because the more we do the more the police can do and and that we fill the gaps that they don't have to do\nAnd this is it has to be a priority and the the you know it's expensive it's difficult when you have such a plethora schools in synagogues and other institutions so much infrastructure here but we have to find a way to improve that and that means it has to be societal because putting the band aids on is not enough\nQuickly or the Palestinians are threatening to reject recognizing Israel how do they put it now\nThat the ... central council met today this was a non binding resolution some people read it they shouldn't\nJump to too much uh but they were actually trying to say that Oslo has run its course that there there was supposed to be an interim recognition of Israel until the Palestinian state was established it wasn't establish because the Palestinians have been allowed it to be the damage has been negotiated\nSo they're talking about cutting security tides and economic ties based on the\nThing to Ninety four Paris economic and political and if this goes back and get actually voted on as a binding measure that will be very dangerous for now I think you know we've seen this before we see it as a\nBargaining chip um they um I don't believe that this that they will move to execute it because\nThey will lose much more\nThat is an American the prime minister of Israel made a trip to them on how it would go a great\nVisit very important in a very positive and because they allow that to be publicized even more and now they talk about it and they said that you know this the whole reaction in the Arab world to it tells you you know some of the change that has taken place\nAnd maybe the basis for further engagement that I don't know what a mine's economic another ties will be but certainly it's a he has tried to the ruler of a month to bring the Israelis and Palestinians gather\nA and we'll see whether that plays out the the other big measure was today in Abu Dhabi where the Israelis won the gold medal in the in the judo in the in the classroom judo\nAnd I'm at the grand slam that's being held there and they played for the first time that take for Israel's national anthem\nAnd the Israeli was recognized that Israeli flag on his uniform that was a minister from Israel there\nThey got around to a big round of applause from the audience and attendance at say after they finished playing Israel's national anthem you know this was a point of contention because in the past they they refuse to recognize the Israeli participants\nI think the way he has to be congratulated wanted help people will we

at gone there when she was doing a residency and they were all these people wow everybody who was killed it was awful\nThat it was awful so the reaction in Washington because there's been a lot of

that is and and now I'm ... and and as you said briefing first briefing we've seen in a while from Sarah Huckabee Sanders and I guess there's a word that the president and the first lady are going to go to Pittsburgh right on Tuesday\nRight well the as the rabbi at a synagogue city welcome other rabbis the city has said he's not but obviously it's the synagogues rabbi that important one\nYeah I'm In the meantime people are talking about what's happened with the three hate crimes are what we think are the hate crimes in the you know the Seventy two hours and the effect that might have in the mid term elections you you've been in Washington a long time what do you think\nWell I have been in Washington a long time but I don't really know how troubled lectures are going to be affected what we do know for instance is that everybody said Hillary Clinton was going to win and it was going to be a landslide et cetera\nAnd they didn't know and I and I want to teach us that the only real poll is on election day that we really don't know what effect is going to be a a well obviously have some effect and in terms of who votes and what they vote for but other than that I cannot tell you\nYeah let me ask you this question um you grow up in a family especially with your brothers\nWho you talked about current events everybody was active in what was going on in your community so I think that fueled the fire for you to do what you're doing it did for me do you think that younger people are more apathetic or do you think more will get out and vote and this and again speculating\nWell it depends I think that millennials have the lowest voting record of any group ever\nI don't tend to vote however generation is ... which is just now coming of age and they'll probably vote in the next presidential election we're probably won't be voting much in this election if any a generation Z\nFigure out what's your next move you know what what am I going to do\nI've had long discussions with so many people on the show about that as you know and will do more of that\nAnd I've had them off the air the last couple of days about what our house has any kind of house of worship what are they doing and it seems that if they don't have some kind of a guard\nSome have opted to have people who have a concealed carry permits for them but they are there in the crowd like they would normally be there are a member of the congregation\nBut they're armed their arm somehow you know they've they've they've got a weapon that if that were to happen they could uh you know they could fire they would be there so\nThat becomes the question it's a it's like the teacher question in Israel we know that is the teachers are what their arms and why are they armed their arms because it's too dangerous for them not to be because it's just the soft target\nAnd that's what places of worship are there are soft targets that is what we're talking about here on America Tonight\nWith me Kate to lenient I always say there's about what's going on in your backyard of mine and there's lots of conversation about that as there would be in and should be because there's massive concern over you know what um what's next what do we do how do we defend ourselves\nTo we want to live in the world paranoid no but do we really need to be wherever our surroundings answer to that question is you do need to be around aware of your surroundings but if I'm In Pittsburgh and I'm In a suburb but I'm going to an early morning service where few different things are going on in the synagogue\nI'm not thinking that this is right for um us being a target today that you know somebody's going to come in and they're gonna they're gonna start shooting and\nUntil somebody called nine one one or the SWAT Team gets here and the police get here we're basically sitting ducks and we had to figure out what we're going to do if we're if we're away from where it's taking place or we're just walking the dog running away or what are we what are we doing\nUm sadly that's where we are so if that's where we are then ... what is the action going forward what is it that is the the thing that you have to do or think about doing are having conversations\nIn these congregations anyway about doing just like they are in school sadly we know and just like they are in other places that should be places that are safe including your own place of employment how ...\nTo the places that are safe including your own\nPlace of employment how often do we see sadly that where somebody's disgruntled somebody from the past comes in whatever the story is and\nIn an instant like that everything changes and we've had that conversation with people who have been\nTargeted we've had three different high profile cases where people and the ten years have come on whether to talk about the um horrific\nFeeling it is when you were trapped and you know you're trying to figure out okay what's the next move in fact\nIf you remember one of the last people we talked to told us about\nBeing at that D.C navy\nYard when the former navy reservist killed twelve people in a mass\nShooting and then was killed by the police that was back in twenty Thirteen\nAnd that the person we talked to we just talked to about a year ago who was in that situation and everybody was ducking recover and running and trying to figure out where ... you know where they were going to go and how they were going to skate that and they were just absolutely stunned at a navy\nShip yard at a Navy Yard wow and so whether it's where you work whether it's where you worship or whether it's where you send your kids to school it is sadly what you do have to contemplate\nAnd does it mean be paranoid looking for your shoulder think the world is coming to an end no it is sad times it's sad that that's what we have to contend with because as a kid\nI certainly didn't have to deal with that many of you listening to me you certainly weren't thinking that and I was in that in between air to where we weren't it wasn't Cold War so there wasn't any of the duck and cover drills\nOr so we ... I didn't have that childhood where you were concerned about that you know you're concerned about the fire drills we had fire drills that's it\nThere wasn't any metal detectors there wasn't a concerned about somebody coming in with a gun kidnapping or somebody doing something else like that it was never a concern now it's not about is it a concern let's move the ball forward what do you want to do\nCongregations need to have those conversations that they have and with their\nFlock their parishioners the people who go there and worship um the the folks in the synagogues whatever whatever kind of worship it is\nAnd make that kind of decisions too we say as we are and just be more alert and do we have some kind of protocol to we have a guard duty have concealed carry\nThroughout the services where there was one or two people who are who are already have the permits for that and feel secure doing it we just don't tell people who it is because why would you do that just let it roll\n'em and that I think is what's happening but I think that's happening more than one would suspect I mean so you got to catch up with\nA sadly the reality of domestic terrorism\nAnd that and how it has altered our lives but to alter it permanently boy we sure don't want that that's for sure\nAnd the Pittsburgh mayor and uh the former rabbi at the synagogue thought that the president should wait till he's coming in on a Tuesday the Pittsburgh suspect says he prefers the term invaders to describe immigrants\nBecause he was listening to the talking points on TV apparently great\nAnd Robert Bauer is his name is complained about the invaders six days before the shooting is what he was saying and uh he he wrote on social media his social media gab it is that I've noticed a change and people saying illegals not that now I say invaders I liked is\nUm you know whatever it is he has forever changed the lives of lots and lots of families and\nYou know he minutes before eleven eleven days before he was writing all kinds of ah stuff about the caravan except for on on the social media site and then on October twenty seventh he goes into the tree of life synagogue\nAnd he wrote that post about invaders and said I'm going in and like in his\nAnti immigrant attitudes to his attack on the synagogue\nSo where yeah and apparently a the Hebrew immigrant aid society which helps refugees was one of the things that he was rambling about so\nUm that's what he said when he when he went in and and I mean just wow I'm I'm believable I mean just on believable as to what has happened\nHere but again\nWe're placing the hatred with love and replacing the idea of okay we don't want this to happen again and not\nDoing something more proactive I think it at this point that has to be that has to be something that's talked about in churches synagogues any place of worship whatever it is that has to have to have to be has to be talked about because if you\nCould be anywhere in this country that certainly was an area\nWhere you would not have expected that to happen was put it that way [noise]\nBut anything that the soft target is a wide open [noise]\nGo to the mail bag next here on ATM\nHis own room the one [noise]\nOne of the sea of radio\nABC News I'm Dave Schreiber agrees with President and first lady repair to visit Pittsburgh\nVisitors big met with mixed reviews maybe she's cheap one else corresponded jumping girl\nBoulders one progressive Jewish group in Pittsburgh saying the president's not welcome until you fully denounces white supremacy response to that the White House or the president has repeatedly denounced bigotry and racism in all forms\nAnd Sarah Sanders said the president is going to Pittsburgh to show support for the Jewish community and she pointed out that the rabbi from the tree of life synagogue has said that he is welcome to NBC's\nChief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl stronger deeper earthquake that struck new Zealand's north arm encouraging the nation's parliament briefly suspended a precaution no immediate reports of damage or injury magnitude six point one quake struck Tuesday Afternoon\nBut imagine you it happens instantaneously but it wasn't ten minute rampage and I know you described it as the first responders feeling just stick to their stomach and describing the scene is one of the worst that they've ever seen and of course it's that way\nBecause you have exploding bullets that are hitting these people in what condition or the bodies and and they're dead and you've got eleven people that died and then you have other people that were seriously wounded as well\nAs to move on to 'em some more emails\nThat are ... just spanned the variety of a couple of different things including this one this one is from ... who says\n... I Hope you are well in your world sister we need your voice the voice of reason and on and reasonable world the pipe bomber I heard that the the guy from Florida had more bombs\nThat he was ready to send to more people is that true well they intercepted thanks for that they intercepted four team packages and ... says are ... um\nBut they say that he had planned I guess from his rambling what he had written in what he was working on that he had a list of about a hundred people he wanted to send packages to when he was going through the list\nSo this was just a handful of the people on the list and we certainly have named them well known Democrats and\nHe told him as gators after he was arrested in plantation Florida that the pipe bombs wouldn't have hurt anyone that he want to hurt anyone but they were real I mean they check them out and they were not fake bombs they were real bombs and they would have been a danger to somebody if they had gone off\nThey think he made the pipe bombs in the van\nAnd they're saying because they found the equipment to stamp the envelopes the paper or the printer everything the powder all that that he needed to do that and hours before he was arrested is so strange he was playing doing the D.

editor columnist and blogger at him life go on the Bloomberg joining us now\nDavid ... looks like it is going to be another one of those days it starts Hyatt and those low I I Want to talk though a little bit about some of the earnings that we've gotten in particular General Electric\nBut it's a nice size earnings report come out I thought wow it's going to get slammed and then the futures market shares for up and people were saying basically cheering that perhaps this is ripping off the band aid and as bad as it can get and evidently they change their views what's going on\nWell look I mean we know the company's going to hold back some cash that otherwise would have gone to shareholders\nThree point nine billion dollars a year that's what happens when a company as big as the cuts instead of it in to a a penny a share each quarter from twelve cents so that's part of the mix and\nYou know you have to bear in mind that when Larry cocaine and the former CEO of dinner her to run GE people figured that he would straighten things out and\nSo the very least you can argue he's getting the benefits of the doubt at this point that\nYou know they're splitting up their power business there there's sort of separating the natural gas piece of it from everything else so you know it's all a matter now of will that strategy work but for the moment at least given how far gee is following a he's given a\nBeing given the opportunity to kind of proved that his strategy will work\nThey will send a conscious turn your attention at Chesapeake Energy and then you were mentioning it previously but you know very interesting that they're making a big acquisition and investors not liking the deal\nWas the biggest ever and and this is a company bear in mind that ah ever since all bring with Clinton who was started the Chesapeake passed away they've been struggling with that\nUh you know prices of of the oil and natural gas haven't always gone there way now you're seeing course to pick up and in those prices and you know the company's responding by trying to expand you know and they were targeting a a shell reason the eagle Ford that\nHas been a focus of some other deals as well so when you put it all together\nYou know it's a matter of whether this company is not only doing something sensible by uh you know deciding to lay out almost four billion dollars would assume deaths above his company ... horse resources development\nAh but but also whether it's going to pay off in the enemy which the wild horse shares up the two and a half percent Chesapeake though are definitely taking a hit here\nI'm actually talking about and get one thing that is interesting to me is how much companies may struggle if they do have huge debt loads and are unable to grow their incomes\nAre commensurate way I'm looking in particular age the Asian community health to a private hospital chain suggest reporting earnings\nThe results that fell short of expectations on both counts and both of these companies that are are really interesting to me because of their huge debt pile they're some of the biggest issue or it's in the U.S high yield bond market\nAnd an H H ca alone it it has more than thirty billion dollars to get out there so it didn't think that they're not meeting expectations and they'd already been beaten up just raises a question about their sustainability at a timeline if the borrowing costs are rising and investors don't have patience for losers\nYeah I mean that becomes a bigger issue or perhaps for a whole lot more companies but you know you think about the hospital business you're expected to be relatively stable and that's the sort of a environment where were you get these kinds of deals with that I mean we know that a CIA came out of a buyout several years back to go public again\nOr at the moment do we mean you you are kind of looking at a situation where where companies like this or are having to deal with\nYou know the issues brought on by higher rates and and there's no doubt that you know it's being reflected on what's happening in the bond market but was also happening in the stock market\nCan just throw your attention to a company maybe you don't know it but a lot of people do American Tower at that's the company based in Boston that if you're making a mobile phone call chances are somehow rather you're being routed through one of their towers\nCompany reported results that exceeded analyst as soon as the stock moving higher interesting because this has to do with five gee rollout soon as a result you're going to have carriers having to spend more in order to upgrade their networks and that means spending more companies such as American Tower absolutely\nAnd uh you know they're they're set up as a real estate investment trust so it's all about you know pay house\nRight you know the the the past the payment without having to pay tax at the corporate level\nYeah exactly and so you know there is no doubt that they have been a beneficiary over the years of a sudden the upgrading of networks and so on\nI mean you look at the stock going back to two thousand nine when this bull market began sure it's had some bumps along the way but it's been pretty much straight up you're you're talking about shared the low point uh we're just below twenty dollars and today it above a hundred and sixty right so it just goes to show you is you know that particular and a lot of working\nAt a lot of their business I Would I think might be fifty ... more than fifty percent of their revenue comes from outside the United states they got big operations in India as well\nAll right someone else that has been operations and if they stay today when they were poor and he says Facebook and I have to wonder if they if we've been hearing a lot of people say that\nThese Facebook earnings are the most important thing since sliced bread and they will determine the outlook for the entirety of the U.S market I mean do you think that these are overblown at this point or do you think that if Facebook reports really positive earnings\nThat in and of itself could turn around market sentiment\nI don't know about in of itself but she has to consider that you know this area of the whole Internet sort of complex you might say\nA has really struggled a bit in terms of their shares lately and looking at Facebook in particular you go back to a peak in July and the stocks down\nThirty five percent or most so\nYou know it's like people are trying to figure out what is this company now and what kind of growth can we expect from them given all the issues they're facing given the need to sort of step up hiring a police accounts and\nAnd deal with some of the post things out there I mean what does this business going to look like down the line what we've seen lately I mean invest it sort of questioning uh the growth outlook for Internet stocks\nLately I mean investors sort of questioning uh the growth outlook for Internet stocks in general so you know Facebook will give us sort of a not a concrete example of what is it that they're going to be able to deliver down the line\nTable ... editor columnist and blogger at ... go on at the Bloomberg I should mention\nThat stocks that turned a solidly positive now the NASDAQ up almost ... percent\nHas to be five hundred up about a similar ... challenged by just a little bit but certainly just another day of volatility when you see things swinging from a significant losses to significant gains right now let's head over to our studios in Washington DC Nathan ... world the national headlines sake I\nBelieve so President Trump says he's positive he can end birthright citizenship for babies of non immigrants and unauthorized immigrants born on us soil telling Axios it's in the process it will happen [noise]\nYes so one of the ironies is is because they've already increase the amount of auctions are quite a lot so far this year it's possible that um that at some point unlikely that at some point that the Treasury Department actually going to stop because they're already raising a lot of net debt so they're already raising\nBetween forty and a hundred billion dollars a month\nOf of dead and you know you you do the math if there's one point three trillion and borrowing\nThen you need to you know basically raised a little bit over a hundred billion dollars a month and and there are there are very close to being there so [noise]\nUm so our forecast is maybe we'll see a little bit more um coupon issue in this uh this quarter and the next quarter it's very likely that the Treasury Department to take a break from increasing auction sizes but they are already very large so it's not like\nYou know it it it's it's kind of like if you ... you know you say we always talk about saving for retirement right at some point you've saved a lot and because of the cumulative amount that you've saved you you may be saved enough this is in a way that in reverse\nIra ... is there a limit to how much money there is to buy all this debt because if you buying the debt that means you're not buying something else\n[noise] yeah so so that ... that crowding out that you're mentioning is a it it's it's certainly something that people are worried about it and\nI you know ultimately we wind up talking about things like bond vigilantes and it will people not show up to the uh to these auctions and when they don't then what winds up happening is the auctions will probably clear but they'd have to clear at higher interest rates\nUm it was it last week we did see some auctions that\nDid not have particularly good I'm good demand for them and uh some what we called direct deters those are those are not primary dealers but others who go directly to the fed\nA when a when these auctions occur and they stopped showing up but when they did you did see a little bit of weakness in those options so that's the real danger the real danger is not will we be able to fund is but it's at what price will have to pay\nIn order to fund these deficits going forward\nI also have to wonder Ira do you believe that the Treasury Department is being realistic with its financing needs because it's low balled what it would need this year\nIt actually came in and yesterday saying that expects issue four hundred and twenty five million dollars and marketable debt from October through December but that was lower than estimates of four hundred and forty billion dollars do you think that they had a political incentives to try to make it look better than it is\n[noise] um I I don't think so I mean they you know one point three trillion is still very big number for what they have the fondue here\nLike they're trying to make things like one way you do that again and one point one three trillion\nCorrect you can imagine one point three trillion anything can well\nWell it's it's it's a lot right uh we had in two thousand nine we had trillion dollar deficits right during the ah um [noise] er during the Obama administration and as a percentage of GDP this is on similar vein for that I think I think the issue is when when we had fiscal stimulus a decade ago\nIf we knew it was going to last just a ... a small period of time right that it was only going to be a couple of years and then the deficits would get better\nBut we're at a point now beach between tax cuts and a demographic so much so much more significant um increases to Social Security and Medicare spending that the chances that you're going to see significantly lower deficits as a share of GDP\nIs going down over time so the only thing that could you know is going to have to get us out of this\nYou know very high deficits as a share of GDP is going to be stronger growth\nUm so you know so that may happen in twenty twenty or twenty Twenty one but if you get a hiccup in the economy you get a recession and the next thing you know you wind up with a situation where you have already high deficits you can't fiscally spend your way out of that without ballooning deficits even further and it becomes a real it could become a real challenge to the\nGun Ira Ira the Federal Reserve is on track\nTo raise interest rates you can debate the reasons why some people say it's because the economy's doing pretty well others say that the Federal Reserve wants to raise interest rates because they want to be able to have the option to lower those interest rates if the economy slows\nTo have the option to lower those interest rates if the economy slows ... is that accurate\n[noise] yeah I I think so I think they also you know they're looking at a lot of different um and I understand but OK stuff that they think three percent is you know a lot of members of the phone saved at three percent is neutral so if three percent natural then you're still looking at another three four hike\nBefore you get to the you know what they would consider um inappropriate interest rate at the moment in the front end\nAll right we'll leave it there thanks very much Ira Jersey chief us interest rate strategist for Bloomberg intelligence and just

I've actually heard that race is really close right now in West Virginia and\nUm my wife Karen was just there campaigning not long ago we'll be back in West Virginia before too long um Morsi's running a great campaign has been a great attorney general for the state and and as a line completely with the agenda that the people of West Virginia voted overwhelmingly for when they voted to make\nA President Trump forty F is president of the United states in the state of Indiana ... Hoosier State of the you know well we've ah we've got a long tradition of uh of bipartisanship from the state of but um but again Mike Braun has run a great campaign\nBecame out of a competitive primary um and uh but he's he's pulled the party together he's got support from independence and frankly support for many Democrats who voted again overwhelmingly and twenty six teams\nOf for this president for this team I mean this is very much the message we're carrying everywhere across the country is that I'm particularly in the states that voted for the president voted for administrators is is to say that that\nWe've been able to do this much so far\nWe think we're just getting started and if we have more partners and in greater support in the house and the Senate or we really do believe that we've only just begun\nTo ask you about when and where Republicans are with one of the biggest issues on the campaign a cycle of this here I have two thirds of winning giving our click and partying unfavorable rating particularly suburban when I when I\nWalk I I have a long time ago trying to explain polls virtually every poll this time two years ago so we're gonna lose HUD and believe in\nVirtually every poll\nThis time two years ago so we're gonna lose I Believe in them look as if the president won a majority of women if memory serves and twenty six thing\nAnd I think it's because um he spoke to the issues that women and men care most about\nSafety and security at home and abroad a growing economy are opportunities in the workplace I mean uh unemployment for women is now at age sixty five year low\nIn the United states or we we've been advancing policies that that were that we believe are going to broaden opportunities for women in the workplace and um but that's a message that that we're going to continue to get out um and not only through November six but\nOver the next two years and uh uh I have to tell you as I travel around the country last last night in Grand Rapids Michigan as\nI Would say the crowd was evenly divided between men and women there's a lot of lot of passionate support from women and men across the country and we're gonna continue to carry a message of the results we've been delivering on the issues people\nCare most about and that includes the issues that women care most about I remember uh when I covered you when you were in the house minority in two thousand eighty thousand Ninety doesn't tend uh that was a\nPretty bad time for Republicans in the house the wives curious whether you'd think a ... if the administration is prepared to be to have a Democratic majority in ... on Capitol Hill\n[noise] while I eat when I'm Out on the road I remind people Jay because I remember I I Know you've you know before you were like a big deal at political\n[laughter] before before I had gray hairs grey hair [laughter]\nUm [noise] I I I I tell people you know I I was there the last time Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house and you don't ever want that to happen again I look instead of increase in military spending they were cut military spending instead of\nCutting taxes they were increasing taxes instead of rolling back the heavy hand the government they were growing government that tried to do cap and trade they gave us Obamacare causing premiums to skyrocket and choices to decline act as if it was a tough time and not politically it was tough time for the country\nUh and and I really do believe that\nThat message is resonating with people all across America we and has made the point we we know the historical trends I think um you know for for every first midterm election that there's been a Republican in the White House\nFor the last hundred years it's been tough except for two of them but I I think this was going to be the exception again I really do believe that because people are looking at the results they're looking at the record\nThey're looking at the contrast of a party that that means even I I read some democratic commentators who actually are writing so that the Democrats really have\nNo agenda except resistance no agenda as cooked except the structured and and and then our agenda is growth is jobs it's security uh it's it's a it's it's principled men and women on our courts at every level I think the American people see the results and I think they're going to say yes\nThat that we have our image or a or an even if they're already are one or two things they knew that it actually worked to get around it when you have been on the campaign trail only the ... and the elderly and kind of like their party had an accent where I can gather well\nLet me let me begin by saying we we had been working with Democrats on a lot of issues that was a prank it was just a handful of days ago that the president signed a bipartisan water infrastructure bill\nPassed almost unanimously in the United States Senate um this year it doesn't get nearly enough credit except maybe in play book ...\nUh [noise] we're the\nParty or how long has it been since Congress actually pass spending bills on time before the end of the fiscal year\nThe cars that did that this year that took bipartisan cooperation of took straw presidential leadership to say that I don't want to president made it clear remember last year he said he didn't want another one of these big omnibus bills\nThat he had to sign in one fell swoop and so in Congress and literally moved legislation in in in blocks and we funded to the federal government and and uh it's something to be proud of and it gives the evidence of the fact we're going to be able to work very productively with the Democratic minority in the upcoming Congress [laughter]\nAnd and and we're going to work with them on issues I I think I think a infrastructure\nThere's no question this is the American people elected a builder to be president of the United states of America he wants to rebuild America's infrastructure\nOf the president talks about a trillion dollar investment\nIn infrastructure and he's absolutely committed to working with both parties to accomplish that a vocational education is another one you know we've got we've got seven million job openings today in America [noise] we've got six million people looking for work\nUm the challenge we have in a growing economy an economy that's expanding last quarter three point five percent\nIs workforce everywhere I go I have businesses saying I mean we're hiring were expanding but uh and I can see some knowledge in the room with some business people in the room today it it's it's difficult to find people so I think I think there's room to work\nOn a bipartisan basis again with the Democrat minority um to forge policies or to to expand vocational education and that this is a president [noise]\nThis is a president who is passionate about working people he's made a tremendous connection to working people all across the country\nIs great admiration for people who work with their hands are involved in the building trades and construction and and the whole range of manufacturing jobs and then the president's absolutely committed to expanding\nVocational education are all over the country to support a growing economy one thing you're going to have to sell a Congress on moving to the space topic is the creation of the the space force which yes has drawn some skeptics on both sides of the ... so you still have your work cut out for you there how do you what's the argument that uh you\nNeed a new space force and you can't do it with an existing structures within the government already will space force is a part of the president's vision for really reinvigorated American leadership in space and so I Would say Jake and Anna first thing is to understand [noise]\nWhen we were on the campaign trail two years ago or the president asked me if I'd be willing if I was elected vice president\nTo share a newly reconstituted national space council of if you remember in in history up until about twenty five years ago the vice president chaired the national space counseling oversaw space policy side [noise]\nJumped at the chance um you're talking to somebody who Karen and I took our kids when they were little [noise]\nTo Cape Canaveral for vacation just so we could go see the rockets um when I was in the Congress I served for time on the NASA subcommittee the science committee and a attended several launches um with some of our\nMost know where the astronauts I'll always kind of the great privilege that I was at a a shuttle launch with Neil Armstrong and my daughter Charlotte so I I have I had a real passion like most people in my generation to who grew up as kids in the sixties and we're watching those black and white television for the inspirational power\nSo we cancel or holiday plant guy look this is um [noise] I Know you didn't mean to be lied about it but it's no laughing matter\nAnd I have to tell the American people the American people know that a nation Without Borders is not a nation they know that\nWe've got to secure our border part of that is building a wall having a physical barrier another part of that is making sure that our border agents have the resources and support that\nThey need another part of that is reforming the laws and ending catch and release changing changing the laws and considering changes like those we were talking about earlier it also means um internal enforcement and also a you know and also means changing the laws in the marketplace of the companies can't\nCan't profit so openly by having people who come into this country in violation of the law we've we've we've got to fix a broken immigration system that the president really does believe\nDid it all begins before to security first and and saying to this Congress that that that we need the funding for the wall we have to have the funding for the wall\nIs something that presidents have been saying for the last two years and um oh we're going to have that fight before Christmas arrives okay the last question in two parts to the yes or no answer and then we'll let you go because I I see a lot of departure\nHere I'm a ... do you support we're gonna have leadership elections in the house and the next couple of weeks do you support a Kevin McCarthy to be the next Republican leader [laughter]\nWell I support having a Republican speaker of the house and we know that\nRight [noise] which you know I was in leadership in the house I was there yeah uh I you know I've done a lot of campaigning\nOut there with Kevin McCarthy he's an outstanding leader and his son a tremendous job is majority leader of the Congress [noise] um you know there are also others who've expressed an interest in that\nHaving run for leadership position in the conference Iran wants to the last ...\nFly a lot [laughter]\nAnd then Iran wants and was elected conference chairman and uh you know I I Know what we'll just leave the decisions about leadership to the men and women who are elected\nA Republican conference but president are absolutely committed to do everything in our power in every hour between now and when polls closed a number of her six to make sure that they're voting for the next Republican speaker of the house\nAnd a lot of ... on the ticket in twenty twenty\nFive would be the greatest on her my life to serve a second term with this president and ah I what I can tell you is a you know to\nThe last two years has just been an incredible experience you know as people sometimes ask me what I was thinking on inauguration day and I'm up on that stage and I was getting ready to raise my right hand and I always tell people I was thinking of my grandfather um\nRichard Michael called life on Michael Richard tense or Richard Michael Callie came to this country when he was about my son's age in his early twenties came through Ellis Island took the train to Chicago Illinois I drove buzz for forty years\nAnd I'm\nA up on the stage I just kept thinking about what would he be thinking he's gone now Thirty years but I think about him all the time we were very close\nAnd um [noise]\nI always tell people I think you'd have two thoughts that Irishman would\nLooking down at the number one I think\nHe'd have been very surprised [laughter]\nNow you're selling your soul and it'd be pretty well [laughter] um\nBut to the last thing is I Would say I my I think my grandfather would would have been looking down from Laurie thinking he was right\nNot about me what about this country\nAnd he left everything he loves he loves the family behind took a one way ticket on a boat across the Atlantic because there's a legend in my family says his mother said to him you need to go to America because there was a future therefore you\nAre and to think that his grandson and his namesake\nAnd just the span of a generation would be standing on a\nPlatform being sworn in as a forty vice president of the United states is a it's a tribute to him um\nAll the rest of it as a tribute to the fact that this is a great country\nAnd we will make America great again\nIt's All right well I mean the ... going

be granted automatic US citizenship regardless of legal status of the parents\nUh critics say the practice sounds from a misinterpretation of the fourteenth amendment\nAnd definitely do with an act of

to pay their respects to the people affected by the deadly synagogue shooting over the weekend with the midterms just a week away California Democrat Adam Schiff told CNN that he has been encouraged by the national reaction to the tragedy\nWe've got to put aside these these ancient hatred and unite around what brings us together and um it's it's encouraging that that is the dominant message coming out of this uh this horror this nightmare\nAnd ... of Bloomberg News congressional reporter she joins us now for more on this story from our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studios in Washington and Anna how are these tragedies sharpening the political divide ahead of the ...\nWell it's been very distressing week you had not only the loving people who were killed in the synagogue in Pittsburgh but also the pipe bombs that were sent the prominent Democrats and the shooting of two African Americans in Kentucky\nAnd the kind of have this unsettled feeling and the country and according to analysts I spoke with yesterday when you're in that kind of environment people tend to go towards comfort\nWhich now a week before the midterms means red states are going to get redder and blue states are going to get Lou are people going to\nKind of go back to their political tribes and try to seek seek out comfort in this unsettled times\nDivisive rhetoric is really nothing new and we heard it before but this time it really feels different is there any way to put your finger on why it feels so different this time\nWell you know part of that it's coming from the top it's coming from President Trump\nAnd you know he has said things that his supporters that are not explicit calls her violence he's not telling people to go out and commit these acts\nBut his supporters are taking kind of this a fear of the other and fear and acting on it and their own way in which is where you get this some of the samples of violence\nAs the president heads to Pittsburgh though we understand that there are a quite a few congressional leaders who've decided not to join him as\nWell part of that was a scheduling and what we heard from the offices of house Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is that they had previous commitments they couldn't make it happen in time but it's there's not consensus that it's the best time the president to go there at the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh has said\nAnd as the president to postpone his trip until they've had a chance to bury their dead on the president is going today he's going with his Jewish daughter and son in law and we're expecting words of unity and comfort from the president in this in this instance\nI was going to ask what you are expecting what awaits him when he gets there and what you do expect to hear from him once he is a on wheels down and starting to talk about this\nWell when the president is in Pittsburgh obviously it's the scene of this tragedy and he's going to put on his presidential self\nAnd that's what we would expect to have in this instance and it's not a political rally it's a very different situation he's speaking to the nation not to his supporters said that's where you going to see a different message from what he might say at a political rally\nAt times like this in our nation's past the president regardless of how people felt about him a how divisive the president was the president took on the role of comfort in chief\nRight and and this president is not someone who has built his brand around being a unifier part of his message when he ran for president in twenty sixteen\nWas to rile up his base stokes fear and I think we're going to see I'm\nMore of that heading into the midterms that hopefully in a way but not today no not today no now is not the time to talk about politics and stuff about the elections even though we only have a few days left until until people aren't going to be the same\nWay I Do want to ask you about that because as the president does do that final campaign push ahead of the midterms eye it looks as though and we have a story on the Bloomberg Terminal about this that he's way more focused on the Senate than the house maybe ... maybe hasn't completely given up on the house button\nKinda skipping some of those races so he can put more of his energy on the Senate what do you know about that\nThe Senate or they're just sending their seats a lot of these are democratic incumbents who are running in red states the president and won\nIt's a lot of these are democratic incumbents who are running in red states that President and won so for those races getting out that you had the base and kind of riling up the right is a good strategy\nHowever that creates a difficult situation for a lot of moderate Republicans running\nAnd swing house districts you hadn't numbers like Brian Fitzpatrick and Pennsylvania and Carlos Curbelo in Florida who are trying to cast themselves U.S interests who are going to work across the aisle and shared priorities and that's hard to do and you have a president who is such a divisive figure\nAnd just in our last thirty seconds here what's the president's schedule between now and election day\nHe has quite a few more states that he's going to visit including West Virginia Florida these are states where he won and twenty sixteen and he's going to do his best to rile up the base and the states\nAnd and these are mainly in the ... Senate seats that are that you just discussed there yeah\nThere there are some very interesting Senate races to watching the seats and session Florida where you have a Bill Nelson the incumbent Democrat running against the current governor Republican Rick Scott\nAnd editor of Bloomberg News congressional reporter a victory for the update well let's head down to Bob ... for check on world and national news from our Bloomberg in our Bloomberg interactive brokers studio\nPeter thank you breaking news this this afternoon from NBC News reporting multiple federal officials say notorious Boston gangster James Whitey Bolger is dead he apparently died in prison\nWill the Trump Administration has been somewhat talking down the meeting this is it will be a meeting on the sidelines of a summit that the economic adviser Larry Kudlow said we'll just be a brief gathering between the two leaders of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said given that it's so short that he doesn't expect any major\nAdvances to be made because how can you negotiate a major trade dispute in one hour discussion so they've been talking down expectations but\nThere's still a lot of uh anticipation ahead of this meeting as you probably know the markets have been very ... because of tariffs so a lot of investors will be looking at the scene for some progress can be made to to ease both the condom use\nThat seems so if the rail that seems so squishy what sort of landmarks are they looking for is that the meeting is going to be short and sweet and they're downplaying or what they expect to come out that they say you know more terrorists if it doesn't go well none of that is specifically what are they looking for\n... and the Chinese would say that's part of the problem is that the U. S. list is millions are so\nWide ranging in so deep that it's hard for the Chinese to meet those requirements\nBut remember that President Trump often touts the fact that he has a strong personal relationship was she so the fact that these two will sit down you know and this high eighties that we've been living through for the last couple of months where there's been no direct talks between the two countries and maybe they can make some sort of\nProgress towards progress maybe they can agree the whole future meetings or agreed to ease the tensions and investors would be very happy with something like that I think\nYou know there was a time Randy in a mate that\nThat's going to have some of the two sides would be you know meeting right now and get it and and and negotiating and talking about what the what they were to announce at\nThe after this meeting we call these things deliver ... that that word I was ... remember those Randy I don't know but um that's that's not clear that even anybody is talking right now in preparation for this or you're twenty media of meeting at the end of ever\nThat's right and Larry Kudlow the economic advisor in the White House has said that the Chinese are stolen while in the United states that they haven't given them any indications that there will be progress at this meeting so that's one of the difficulties but I think the Chinese are are probably smartly waiting until the mid term elections are done there's just too much political noise right now to hold concrete\nUh discussions on trade or too much would leak to the press there's too much at stake so their their strategy as we understand it is to wait until the midterms are over and then really delve into the issues\nOkay let's wait until after the midterms and that they're down now let's just pretend that there is the ways that has been predicted and that the Democrats picked out does that make a difference and wetter these terrorists take effect or not\nIt makes a difference in the sense that it gives it gives some relief to Trump where he doesn't have to worry about in media election so if he does for example impose more tariffs on Chinese imports he's not going to face a huge backlash from the voters\nOr the Democrats taking control the house or possibly the Senate I don't know how much impact that would have because a lot of the Democrats are very strong\nHawks on Chinese trade for example I'm Chuck Schumer the Senate leader for the Democrats\nHas been passively supporting Trump's a trade war against China because\nHe's a hardliner on these trade issues so I don't know if it in that respect to change things but it takes a lot of the political spotlight off of these talks for Trump and it allows him to um either slap more tariffs on it or make some sort of concession with China without being seen as weak and the types of voters\nMeantime I have a a new story on the ... terminal that says that the ...\nCan the odds of voters meantime I have a a new story on the terminals that says that the next round of\nTariffs against China could be ten times worse for us consumers how so\nWe'll do the administration since they started imposing tariffs of trying to target Chinese imports that would in in ...\nThe consumer inflation\nThe show and they've already slapped tariffs on two hundred fifty billion dollars of Chinese imports us imports about a little over five hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese goods a year so if they do impose tariffs on the remaining good it'll probably be a lot of goods that we buy the stores so we will see consumer inflation\nHeavily impacted by those products in addition to that the administration has talked about increasing the rate of terrorists on goods that are already suffering from these duties from ten percent twenty five percent so that would also affect everybody's pocket books quite\nA bit more Iran and we want to just to interrupt a conversation with this headline which is

day though I mean we started with ... you said after the bell we're going to hear from Facebook and apple refreshing the Mac book air for the first time in a long while\nAnd we'll see because we hear earnings obviously for them later in the week\nAnd investors saying yeah I haven't passed their up about one thirty one percent and whatnot but that one point four percent but now let's say yeah also the phone that's behind belly that\nCompany in terms of earnings and my thought I'd rather they were going to say it's really all about this book today that we're going to talk about later had to be successful about hurting men's feelings Sarah Cooper is the author this but this made its way around the newsroom in a big\nWay can I say there's a bunch of cartoon never get into the markets cause that's important today was got stuck to actually at today but that's like a man and female or male female perspective on they both like a guy says I'd like a race and people will be that as\nThe guy having ambition the woman says it and she's got a kid so I'm just going to put that out because that's just like I said that we're gonna have some time that\nWe are in Haiti so let's get into those mass markets are we got a couple of guys here to tell us about events signal Raila I'd go back or strategist day Wilson Bloomberg stocks editor afraid to be sitting next to me I I'm just glad that both has not made it this way\nWay so you what do you make of this fence what what sort of marketing we live in an hour a week before\nThe midterms how much is all that weighing on a stocks and bonds I actually think\nIt's huge but it's by way of the trade situation with China and Trump and everyone get excited last night when he said I can do a deal with China right now is in reality Trump didn't say anything I mean if he wanted to do a deal with China it would have to be equivalent to the Canadian trade which is\nA lot of talk and then end up exactly where you started he's\nInvested way too much political of skin in this game to just roll over and give China what they want so this is going to play well past the midterms\nAnd essentially what we can really hope for at the G twenty and I think the markets probably begin to digest the says about the best of going to come away with as a template for future trade negotiations nothing's going to get settled in the ...\nThe G twenty of course being when President Trump and president Xi of China are scheduled to meet and actually have a discussion\nAbout so all listened to Z as him and and market trading higher this morning based on potential a trade deal with China is all being watered down with the reality that none of that is going to happen and there were reports out of the White House that they were going to continue putting pressure on China right through them to terms\nFor obvious reasons one plays well to the base the other it gives them leveraging the negotiations\nYeah exactly so they come on in here what are you looking at right now what's the big theme on your screen\nWell it's just the extremes that we're seeing when it comes to uh the reactions to earnings and\nThey really go in both directions I mean you've been talking about General Electric already down below ten dollars a share for the first time in nine and a half years not only on the origin of course but they're cutting their dinner than a to a penny a share from twelve cents that's on a quarterly basis they figure they'll say close to four billion dollars a year doing that\nUm they're splitting up their power business\nI mean a lot rightness earnings report this is the first one to the new CEO who is just appointed a three expected a lot of changes I think what's interesting is that this accounting investigation that so they're making changes in the company but wait wait what\nThat they're going to step it up because you know you're talking about the twenty two billion dollar accounting charge related to the power business and so the government regulars are already looking at that unit and now they're looking a little more closely in light of the uh the right off so that's part of the mix so\nWhen they come back today but it's interesting if you you know back on the trading desk and you guys would see these headlines come across and ... you would think why\nOh yours is obsolete selling it out of the gate was by because what Wall Street loves to write down they think that things are going to go forward in a better way it was a silly reaction to me right out of the gate but then again we saw the markets correct themselves and and get some intelligence behind them afterwards I think\nIt's due to a club yeah right I mean the stocks outlet ... percent\nYeah but it's other nine and a half your love it's even worse than\nWhat it this way I mean they held off on the ... for a few days specifically to kind of give the Larry culpa then to see all the time\nTo get to speak with business and so you figure that you know this is the first set of quarterly results with him in charge so you take what's called the big bath write off everything it all gets better from here that would explain the initial reaction people went back and looked at things and really\nAre they better from your well they also looked back and saw that Flint or he did this a couple times and there was just like ... is a closet full issues dropping these homes predecessor exactly oh\nYes exactly so in terms of I don't know there were so many markets stories out there a Guggenheim saying the covers it lying about the next recession something going something strange going on in the stock market Byron Cameron cries a how one trillion dollars may end up being a sign of the top and just talking about you know to pull back that we've seen in global equities\nA and stocks here in the United states I don't know events when you add it all up or is there any kind of consensus about where we are in this market environment you put up a China death and the five hundred it's been quite a steep drop and\nIt looks like especially over the last few weeks that confidence has been shaken and the markets trading more in a cellar rally not by the mode um you know passive investors holding it up professionals perhaps pushing it lower the U.S and peace flirting with their territory I mean if we make that turn into that area\nMay see some capitulation and a little brought sell off even further going into the midterms it's not setting up for healthy market in the fourth quarter\nA ... after the midterms you you've got sort of one of two situations it either in house goes Democrat or Republican\nBut the consensus is that either way spending is going to increase in the fourth quarter yields are going to be higher all of that doesn't way well on equities especially given the fed is going to probably look at that and say December Moscow\nSince ignore Ella joining us we really appreciate you can of course ah listen

badgering them to do it and guess what they were right in the business is rebounding it's up twenty five percent from the bottom and it's not back where it was right so there's that one I learnt now

have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much of Democrats eked out victories in those states and picked up the seat in Kansas they can control the seats and keep their majority Democrats also pick up seats from the GOP in Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable\nAre far from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats the Republicans picked up night\nDonald Trump didn't want a single state according to the polls\nJohn Kerry was going to be president because of the polls I don't have a crystal ball\nAnd I just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard and the way you play hard in this case\nIs you make a decision now\nThat you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen in your district check out my website so you if you're in one of those key pivotal no tip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every seat is important and when you vote no that if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for below sea\nIt'd be vote for a Republican maybe you're you're voting to keep the status quo of economic growth and prosperity in a strong national defense and build a border wall and it'll be a boat for any democratic senator

rightful capital of Israel oh I've got to move it from Tel Aviv Israel and they never do it because they never have the courage to do it\nWhat Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the region and said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my word\nOh why don't we have a little bit more of that\nThat is one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word is gonna he's fighting for it we see it now happening on the immigration fight or the president and Lindsey Graham of teamed up to an birthright citizenship in other words if you enter the country illegally and you happen to give birth to a child that child's instantly\nEven though you're in the country illegally interest in it initially is just automatically a U.S citizen does it matter that your parents are here illegally\nWell that is only to encouraging other illegal behavior we're asking people we support immigration legal immigration\nWe now see caravan organizers ... illegal migrants on the buses headed for the U.S although some of the people now have been turning back\nUm the Pentagon now is deployed over fifty two hundred troops\nThey're putting up barriers ... barbed wire and other things because we can't have what happened on the southern border with Guatemala Mexico Mexico southern border where people just rush across\nAnd rush over the police you know we had apparently a confrontation yesterday one dead dozens injured\nAs a caravan was clashing with Mexican authorities we don't want that here we are saying if you want to come then come legally don't come illegally respect America First thing to getting into America has to be respect America the sovereignty respect our borders respect to America is\n\nUm this is getting interesting about Robert mall I don't really know what to think about it I'm a little torn about even talking about it but\nApparently Mike Allen you see if I can pull this story up here is a tweeting out that special counsel former FBI Director Mueller is accused of\nSome type of sexual impropriety\nAgainst women and the FBI now is looking into it that it's a false stories so I Want to give you both sides of it daily news as of a very different take on it and they're headline is FBI asked to investigate allegations that women were offered cash to accuse Robert Mueller\nOf sexual assault I Know for a fact that a tape exists\nOr where there is a very prominent person\nOn the tape on about Mueller very prominent person on the tape offering\nMoney to somebody to make allegations against Donald Trump why this tape has never been made public I don't know\nWhat it does exist and I'm not going to go any further than that at this point so this type of thing does happen and I think like every other case\nI mean I'm not a fan of the team that Robert Mueller put together I you know I'm always torn goes I never want to credit you I'm I'm very fond of law enforcement\nI just hate the people that he hired in this witch hunt how we ever got off into things like you know bank loan applications when it was supposed to be about Trump Russia collusion you know we're at a point in history where this is how phony Democrats or they don't really care about Russia collusion and interference if it's Donald Trump\nBut when you have real evidence 'cause there's no evidence of Trump Russia collusion when there's real evidence of Hillary paying for a phony Russian dot CA disseminated by top intelligence officials\nAnd FBI officials to lie to the American people before an election\nIs used to commit fraud on Pfizer court judges four times to get into the Trump campaign visa V. eight Trump campaign associates and then is part of old media elite strategy that we've now learned about it's taken Eighteen months\nThat dot CA is used in linked all over the media to create the impression oh there's smoke here about Trump Russia collusion\nBut the leaks were about the phony ... a Russian does save the Hillary paid for on top of of course Hillary committing multiple felonies and having a rigged investigation\nAnd this week strategy leading to the appointment of Mahler which we now know to be the insurance policy just in case Trump wins because Trump shouldn't lose a hundred million to one according to Peter Struck\nEven Peter Struck said there's no there there are you still paid said ... just prior to the appointment of Mahler they had no evidence of any kind of type of collusion none\nIt's outrageous you know you watch this this vile anti Semitic racist Trump Peter murdering a Lebanon innocent people injuring six others I mean you see it's basically the face of evil evil exists it exists in\nSociety exist all around the world why we need to spend the money we spend on a strong national defense that's why we need to be tough with oh Kim Jong un and the mullahs\nEnron you know it's we had the deadliest attack against the Jewish community on American soil in our history\nPresident said no will destroy you if you attack them which was the right answer is no place in this country for evil racist anti Semite none and I don't think\nThere's been a president in modern history that has demonstrated his support for our number one ally in the middle east and frankly between Great Britain in Israel but this is the closest alliance we have\nAs America founded on Judeo Christian principles it's a personal connection in his own family with his daughter and son in law is grandchildren\nYou know as um you know he's the one that the port of the Nazi death camp guard Obama didn't do it ... but he

southwest Florida and I think what happened with some of those nutrients mixed with the red tide and exacerbated the we we got it bad that was already got a really really bad\nSo I'm committed to making sure that we're combating that stopping the discharges gun in order to do that you gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnership I'll be able to do that Gillum wants to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with him on any of that say I think any of those problems we had an older\nGuy but I

I think that it's cute based on who's you know answering the phone don't want it to Pennsylvania one on my computer right now no on ... on a district first focus on just on there\nWas no one answer is no one else as all skewed towards down close to Philadelphia I put ... ... [noise]\nI I'm not sure exactly what you say explain that again you think are inaccurate I agree OK\nYeah and I think it's just some results or cause a lot of district for the first uh most of the Republican voters and the lord stuffed northeast such right on the border with New York right right I Want to answer the phone up there it's all ... towards the bottom towards Philadelphia\nOh that's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and you know look everywhere here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live I we are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota raises California races\nBut the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection\nWell we need a majority but it doesn't have to be a big majority but if you can win the majority and pick up the Senate seats I think we can pick up hold the Senate seats that need to be held\nThen it could be a very good night one week from now but I Am telling everybody if in my opinion right now Republicans plus three for the Senate they add three senators but I also would say that\nThe house I'd say it's probably on paper looking a poll paper and I'm hesitant to say this but\nIt was analyzing the races analyzing all of the new candidates you know forty five retirements in this time I was I Would say it's ... it's\nIt's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with a toss up because right now the Democrats have two hundred and five locked in races for the house the Republicans two hundred and now the problem is the toss ups are almost all Republicans say you're going to have to run the table on those\nWe put all that information the most important in the top thirty that we picked then identified it's easily you know\nYou can find it easily at ... dot com\nYeah so I don't know I'm looking at it I made like a toss up right now Michael shit I'm of a toss up then I mean I have it with a toss up on the street looking one Ninety two but a lot of ... seats Shawn\nLook let me give me one anecdotal piece of evidence we know one twenty sixteen that the exit polls show and all the polls leading up to the election show Donald Trump wasn't gonna win and the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and he said he lost everything Florida gone North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan\nOr Wisconsin gone and the same thing happened to two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God\nTwo thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen a in a mid term if we go back twenty fourteen it was for cast as say close Senate race but the G O P one nine Senate seats\nI mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize\nThat if you don't want Nancy Pelosi speaker if you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do in your power at the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house that's the best case scenario one is a split decision\nThey gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker the worst case scenario it's Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen\nRight now the ... they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends whether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about\nIf they don't want it matters or going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment\nGoing to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats are we going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like you're the same people that ruin the health care system\nWith three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand a boat for any House Democrats to vote for ... below sea any Democratic Senate voters a boat for sure\nThat we should have a pretty good night a week from now\nBut the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide\nAnyway I um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program we're going to get a little into the whole issue\nOf what held how how big an issue health care is a for this campaign a Rhonda Sanders gubernatorial candidate was on with us earlier he was really good today and we have a great
