C. dot org Tony Perkins after the uh the bottom of the hour we're going to go to the phones and say hello and welcome to ah Martha in San Antonio Martha what's going on\nHello into a lot more of a I'm a high I just wanted to tell you that I think it's kind of a good thing that Dianne Feinstein held onto that letter for six weeks 'cause I mean when we have heard more stupidity and violence from the left\nAnd and one more thing for the first time ever I'm sixty three years old and I'm going to register tomorrow to vote [laughter] great my husband is too for the first time ever [laughter]\nWow isn't that what we did this process motivate you guys to go and do that\nYes sir um we've never really been into politics but when I watched a Donald Trump come down the stairs and he said that he was going to be the best president ever I wanted to believe him and my heart believed him and now I Know it's true now I Know it's\nI think there are a lot of people like you I think there are a lot of people like you and your husband who probably haven't set it out loud thank you Martha appreciate your calling in um a lot of people like you are probably going to go into the same thing\nIt would go and register to vote going to go and vote going to go and get this done going to go and take part of the process I think it's the right thing to do\nThe right thing to do with the girl a lot of people who won't color radio show and say so by the way I I disagree on her releasing an earlier would have cause even more a rambling in rank or I disagree I think that actually re released early on\nI think that the end result would have been we would have had the investigation sooner but if you have any investigation sooner he would've been confirmed a lot sooner you would have been on the court for several weeks now I'm\nFeinstein settlement letter for simple reason she must not have believed it\nShe must not have believed it so much she had an independent investigation going on she sat on it because you didn't think he was going to get be able to get past the committee\nAnd I don't know that she believed that the allegations were strong enough once you knew that she needed it that's when she went to it and she completely a release the the privacy of Dr Ford when Dr Ford wanted to stay anonymous very very strange other the whole thing unfold\nHR editing nine four one packs a day at eight nine four one Seventy four seven Joe ... dot com we come back it'll be Tony Perkins use the president of the family Research Council go to ... dot org or I go and make that happen also will have plenty of your phone calls on the program it's the Joe ... show we're going right back [noise]\n\nBut when the court steps in and short circuits that process like it did on abortion like it did on marriage you do not reach consistent consensus and there's division in the culture I've never seen it more intense than it is right now and until the court\nMoved back to its proper boundaries and the elected representatives shape the policies for this country it will continue\nIts Tony purchase the president of the family Research Council and Farsi dot org you bring up some ... some very important point I'll add marriage to what I said a little while ago about what was it in the constitution 'cause it's not in their sort of states should mess citing these things I'm having said but what about the politics of personal destruction\nThey will take a person that they get the kids absolutely do anything to on the merits as Kavanaugh said you can't you couldn't beat me on the merits suddenly a letter to you have for two months showed up\nYou couldn't beat me on the merits suddenly I'm this horrible guy I'm evil according to one you've got one guy saying that he's Spartacus you've got the other people will get interrupting Grassley Everytime he spoke\nIt is this the overplay their hand these people are really start to see the ... the winding down of the politics of personal destruction when you're going after somebody you just don't like politically\n[noise] I I Wish the answer to that was yes that is it's going to begin decreasing where I can see that because they solve and it didn't work I I Wish that were the case I don't think it is\nI I think what what what's happening here Joe\nIs that we're seeing the left throw a tantrum\nBecause they're they're accustomed to Republicans holding when the operation gets intense when they fire those first rounds of those personal destructive grounds that they fire they find the Republicans I mean why did they go after the whole\nYou know a ... alleging than he was a gang rape is that he you know attacks sexually attacked people because a lot of conservatives we care about those things are important as we don't want we don't want that type of stuff elevated in our society in fact we think it has no place in our society\nSo they think that they're going to make him radioactive by by accusing him of that and then everybody is just going\nTo run from him well ... it's a new day because we've seen that that card played over and over and over again in what's happening now is at the same cultural elite that we're attacking him the media and others playing into that\nWell they're the same people who are attacking the values that conservatives across this country holds so dear right same reason that they attacked President Trump that's why I think President Trump support is so solid among conservatives is because it's the same people that have been attacking conservatives for the last four decades\nThat are now attacking the president and all of his nominees so\nI think we're in a new day I think Republicans had finally gotten the backbone conservatives are saying you know what\nIf we want to keep this republic we have to fight for it and that means we have to stand up to the personal attacks and yeah we're going to have to take some ah some ugly hits but you know what\nWe're not going to we're not going to capitulate we're not running up a white flag in fact\nWe don't own any white flags anymore we're going to have charging\nRight what what this president I think you're right I think the white flags were put away if not if not thrown out of the different presidents do you think they would have folded because politically speaking it would have made sense for the guy who nominated him\nTo say I rescind the nomination ... with another president it would have been a very quick for Kavanaugh to say I re soon you know I don't accept the nomination because of these things I'm a distraction we always hear about what our site I don't want to be a distraction someone to get out of the way was it the ...\nYes no question you know 'cause it's another day yeah I mean look courage brains courage\nAnd I don't agree with everything this president has said and done in his lifetime right but I Do agree with his leadership today America when when we were going into this election and twenty sixteen and many of us saw\nFor what it was our republic was hanging by a thread over a raging fire right and we had Donald Trump who said you know what I'm going to give it my best shot to save it and we said\n[laughter] I don't know but we don't have an option and we're going with you and and look what he's done he's done exactly what he said he was going to do he's fighting and people are tired of being pushed around being marginalized by the left now that doesn't mean I don't mean to be very clear and Joe\nWe understand ... ... ... as Christians I must speak to this from a Christian sample injury I run a Christian ministry right and that's the way we look at these things\nThese the Democrats are not our enemy the the the L Jimmy ... on our enemy we don't have those people all we love those people\nBut we love 'em enough to speak truth because we know that what America has to offer will only continue if we have a solid moral foundation\nAnd so we're going to work to preserve that foundation and we're going to work to strengthen America Again so that it can be a nation that not only allows people here in this country to prosper but when America is strong the world is more stable America has a leading role to play and for the first time in a long time\nWe have an administration that understands that\nAre in a minute or so we have left with Tony Perkins you ever have you ever see a president it's a Family Research council go that far C. dot org\nLet me ask you about the germs going about a month or so ago month and a half two months ago the house was certainly going blue is going to be a blue wave of the Senate probably would go blue to as it sits today if we stay motivated energized I think the Senate probably picks up two or three Republican seats in the house or as now up for grabs\nIt in the overplay their hand but I asked about a little while ago\nBy the left do you think that it it's it's a week and a lot of people who were center center center right right right\nOr the left do you think that it it's it's a week and a lot of people who were center center center right right right maybe even conservative who sat on their hands and said I Can't vote for Trump is going to make them go to vote in November Tony less than a month from now we're going to find out who gets to the house and Senate\nAre they re energized will you see now this blue wave go away\n[noise] um I I I think your analysis correct I think we see maybe two or three seats picked up in the Senate I think the houses a toss up ... the difference I see though is that I think there were people who were Trump very supportive of Trump not supportive of a Congress that they don't think has done a whole lot\nHas\nTo have at least a Republican Congress to and to watch his back while he does the majority of the work so I think they're motivated to go vote because of what this president has accomplished\n... Indian food do you agree with me that's because the left will stop at nothing to basically went up\nTo lower it absolutely they they look I think what was on display in the last three weeks is how desperate the left is to keep the labor's of government and they want to do it through the courts and they know that intuitively if there's this much opposition this president this administration must be doing something right regardless of what the mania says\nWe always appreciate the time it's Tony Perkins president of the family Research Council F.

for the U.S and its allies along with Afghanistan national army\nTo respond effectively bill a very good even to the Taliban has struck south a district center south of capital is this is this a suggestive of a new pattern or is this more of the same that we've been reporting on for the last week's could even if you a bill\nAnd John yes unfortunately the uk and you're in a pattern that we have been reporting on this occurred in Wardak Province which is just up the couple we've seen this happen\nIn the neighboring Logar Province and then of course ... sneak out those problems you had the visual capital that was partially overrun by the Taliban over the summer so yeah this is something that we are ...\n... ... ... the Taliban of kept the pressure on the Afghan forces in a you know in the area of south and east of ...\nAnd it it's very concerning to the Afghan government is happening on the government's doors\nAnd the Afghan military has been only incapable of stopping\nAnd they rate in just\nThe terriers has been only incapable of stopping it\nAnd they rate into the center and then they melt away did they did they plunder and the way they've done before bell\nAbsolutely did the Taliban claim they capture orange ... men military equipment obviously on the uh\nI have no reason to doubt the movies often released video showing ... you know the district police chief this different than about is the one where and she's always lived in August she doesn't eleven\nWhere the Taliban shot down a U.S a helicopter carrying just a movie and killed Seventeen navy seals and there are an additional I Believe it was another Fifteen fourteen or Fifteen Afghan and US military personnel so this\nHas been a contested district where the Taliban in ... valley in this district where they openly um our governing ah there you know patrolling the area and and this is all happening under the nose of the Afghan government\nDoes the Afghan national army have a response to we learn anything about how they you you may not mentioned in past weeks that a down helicopter with us of with the corps has a fully ... fully visible in the video that there was no response even daylight so is that the same thing here no response to the attack\nThe ... ... what happens when the district centers over on here it failed and often retreats from it and then they control areas around it\nThe government off and send in their best force commandos and some army and it's often with us as they come they chased the Taliban out the Taliban typically you know it turns out before they rather than taking taking a fight to it\nI'm John bachelor then the national security report\nSegment brought to you by scholar scholar a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world leading the wave of retail transformation\nVisit scala dot com today to modernize your digital experience\nDon Johnson and bill roses are here to report on the vast landscape and we go now to Africa to Somalia you will recall awake past bill reported that the ... al Shabaab which is linked to the cutthroat said al ... al Shabaab struck cat and Italian unit\nIn Mogadishu and I looked for the follow up to that I was a suicide bombing attack al Shabaab is a an indigenous\nUprising but it has transnational reach so therefore I was\nI was puzzled by the U.S strike ... an airstrike on the southern Somali coast in these last days and bill reports on it tells you keep a\nVery careful map of the U.S airstrikes in Somalia for this year this is the southern Somalia cos south of Mogadishu what do we know about what was the point of it these look like Penn pranks on a map and I don't see the overall strategy for us to participate\nYeah for us strategy you move to forest in Somalia who support the African Union or some ... ... ... national army in their operations to get off the problem is that yeah it's all smiley national are really any\nMore like a a a clan militias clan militias show in this particular strike\nUm they get an area that was very close to where the smiley army was trying to ... what\nThey're the defense ministry called a safe haven I'm is an area that out the twenty thirty miles northwest city ... um which was run by Shabaab several years ago so this was a you know a lot of the the interesting thing we're tracking strikes in general\nAnd in Libya and things like that they tried to the military at news government tries to call them out of our strikes\nBut really there for military operations off in in uh sometimes they are ours cells and their their networks but they're all off hunts military operations to fight these insurgent groups and you have to keep in mind that\nThese terrorist groups in the in certain groups that want him back out and buy inches or affiliates whatever you want to call them their primary goal is to\nEstablish Emirates in in the furthering the goal of his show in circles he a key part of it the ... of our bombs that bottom gets western part is that I think that's just that ... get a job\nGo see if I understand this bill so the U.S military and I'm presuming these are drone strikes not I'm not warplanes the U.S military is in the air wing of the African Union forces fighting in Somalia and\nUh the African Union forces are fighting indigenous uprisings nothing to do with transnational terrorism\n[noise] no no this is the first parties often but Shabaab he's both a you know in the kitchen is insurgency buddy and also we had his branch in Somalia\nYou know indigenous insurgency but he's also he's had his branch in Somalia so you know it's it's not one or the other it's both Shabaab is you know local insurgent group that is an Islamic search group that pledge allegiance to al ...\nHas out ... years um and it's you know instruments and its leaders and fighters abroad again experience so al Shabaab is part of al ... network\nIs part of al Qaeda and but yes you're correct US military often operating it's or to the holiday army that's ... that's the strike was they like to call them ... that's not the case right right\nNow it's sort of wondering if your mom a ration trying to say we are not\nYes we appeal to Congress because you pay for this at least be articulate when we use drones means are not counterterrorism strikes these are\nThese are police operations I think that was the polite way to talk about in the twentieth century Tom the Taliban is looking to an Afghan election or to say that the Taliban is going to disrupt it a is an understatement a you also mentioned that the Islamic state is involved how so\nWell you know both the Taliban Islamic state of course uh you know denied the legitimacy of Afghanistan's elections and what's the key thing here is that the U.S government has been quite delusional about what they think the Taliban is willing to do with the Taliban leaders are willing to do\nYou know early this year the state department actually called on a tall bond to turn to turn over their bullets for about ... and to get out and vote and become part of the political process Afghanistan\nThis is completely inconsistent with every piece of public rhetoric you'll see come out of the tall bond there's no evidence that the Taliban is willing to lay down its bullets for ballots I mean this is just mindless rhetoric really in any event this new I'm Calvin theme of the came out just today emphasize\nThe fact that they reject the Afghan Afghan elections which are coming up on October twenty if I Believe the parliamentary elections they rejected my numerous grounds they they claim that the elections are basically just they sort of a ... for the foreign forces meaning of the U.S\nThey reject the legitimacy of the Afghan government and they claim that basically it's their religious duty to disrupt or prevent the elections from going off\nNow that Taleb on Islamic state is very careful in the statement anyway rhetorically to say that they're going to try and be careful not to kill Afghan civilians indiscriminately and if they're going to try and target security forces that are in charge of preserving the elections are safeguarding the elections\nWhat's different about that now of course they will if they do strike out they will end up killing civilians but what's different about that at least in terms of their rhetoric is Islamic state doesn't care Islamic state says we're going to go after if you're participating in the elections as your your civilian or otherwise\nThen you we have the right to kill you and so there's obviously it has absolutely no compunction about going out and killing whoever is taking it apart and elections where's the top on because they're a little more sensitive toward\nSort of how they're they're perceived publicly and in terms of popular appeal at least want to put a little bit of a shine on their sort of their violence\nBut the Taliban is against the elections not correct time they're not they're not in no way in ... at first\nThey couldn't be any clear that they are against the elections and here's the point that the whole us strategy in Afghanistan is about right now we we call the strategy is about trying to get the Taliban and lay down its arms and ... and recognize the legitimacy of the Afghan government and participate in the political process\nIt they couldn't tell us anymore for any more often than they already are that they reject the Afghan government and the political process and it's against the ... laws against religious obligations and that they basically need to undermine the Afghan political process because all it is for them is basically just a sort of a a puppet of of the foreign invaders\nA bill I checked with you on your sources right now this Afghan national election it's a lining up to be a failure or at least considerably diminished considering how much\nIn the old days you remember when we used to make a big deal about an election Afghanistan now it looks like they're going to hold it in in in a small club in capital and call it an election\nYeah that's absolutely right up in officials are saying it is a lot of places are not going to the ... right that these elections are largely going to be held in the in the major cities and the more constantly off those strikes\nThat most of the Afghans are not going to be a represented in this election and now that is a major failures seven years at the U.S invasion that you know it's the ... situation is worse than a than at any point and that polling centers can't be open in Afghanistan to\nRepresent the will of the Afghan people that the Taliban are very clear that the government is it legitimate that aid you view elections is illegitimate and the election looks illegitimate when they can't open polling centers\nBill Roadshow and Tom Johnson senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracy they keep the long war journal the Afghan national election democracy\nFailure upcoming this national security segment brought to you by scholars scholars leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world\nLeading the wave of retail transformation visits scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience\n\nThomas's to be a team player I leave ... socks news those comments from Supreme Court justice by Kevin on the White House ceremony today I thought since ... has more live\nWe have all the road to the high court was a bumpy one\nSenate confirmation process was contentious an emotional justice Brett Kavanaugh says he isn't bitter as a new justice on the Supreme Court\nI understand the responsibility that I bear and Kevin ... knows he has big shoes to fill us Justice Anthony Kennedy successor Justice Kennedy became one of the most consequential justices in American history\nOf Senate narrowly confirming Kavanaugh following accusations of sexual misconduct from at least three women he denies all the allegations but some of Kavanaugh's critics on the left refuse to give up already calling for his impeachment\nI the reason why I get to that is that China really wanted to have the head of Interpol to be a Chinese national the Communist Party official and they were successful in that and for them to do this to take a a mom\nAnd the disappearing indicates that they don't care about China's international standing anymore\nThat what's really important for them is solving internal political disputes\nWe've seen this and the Maoist era you know siege and paying this one mile Arab powers\nHe's also ended up with ... mile ... instability you can't have um what a siege and paying wants\nThis really I think is an indication that we are going to go back to the intense political struggles in the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties this is really bad news because China right now looks to be unstable\nMy palm pale sad in this meeting that he regrets that there will not be an annual meeting between Chinese and us diplomats and military officials do in mid October so not only of the ... stop Gordon and Secretary Mattis canceled his visit to China\nBut there will be no conversation between diplomat sci fi follow this reporting\nYes well you know the Chinese are blaming us for the cancellation of the security dialogue but we canceled only because the Chinese said that their top the admiral would not be available um and so you know this is and also they pulled the admiral from meetings he had in the U.S [noise]\nSo really what the US was reacting to was China um centrally cutting off the milk Tamil discussions\nAs we pointed out before these melt Tamil dialogues benefit China much more than the u._s. so for Beijing to cut them off shows temper tantrum shows counterproductive diplomacy shows that people in Beijing are are not really thinking anymore they're just getting angry so this is not good\nAll right we'll check jobs the tension between ... and my palm pale we checked off the threats to Taiwan we checked off the threats to the freedom of navigation we checked off\nThe threats that you're not allowed to mention that a million we girls are being brutalized by the Chinese because they're the wrong religion or have a religion\nWe checked out the fact that will be no ... going to North Korea\nIf I understand it correctly there's an upcoming visit a weekend visit to young young uh uh Mike Pompeo is in young young but there's an upcoming conversation between Pyongyang and Moscow and Beijing I think Ken is going to participate in that\nThe puzzle here Gordon is with this deterioration between the U.S and China where does that lead moons utopian has some is is is Korea now collateral damage to wane east temper tantrum\nWell you know it could be John you know a lot of people have said we've had simply this ideology for for decades that you got to be nice to the Chinese and they will reciprocate well you know President Trump explicitly try that last year he said look I'm going to go easy on the Chinese on trade if they help on North Korea\nWell they didn't help on North Korea they took that as a big green light to violate sanctions we've got to do something different and you know I'm not saying that pressure is going to absolutely work\nBut it can't do any worse than the cooperation path I think what President Trump needs to do is to start sanctioning Chinese banks\nReally imposing costs on Beijing for transferring ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology to the north Koreans for violating sanctions for doing all the rest of it you know we have all these disagreements with China we've got to have it out with the Chinese because as disagreeable if that is\nYou know we've tried the other approach and its miserably failed it's made the Chinese even worse than they were before and so you know we are the author of almost of Chinese aggression it's not like we're the aggressors but nonetheless we made it easy for the Chinese to be a embolden and to try to take down the international system\nMoon Jae in is the president of South Korea he has made it very clear he wants to reunite the peninsula a quote today and this story from Beijing a new order is being created on the Korean Peninsula\nGordon is it is moon on yesterday's news or is he part of the problem does he worked for Beijing or does he work for Seoul\nNo no he works for appearing young um if you read the rest of what Moon Jae in said when he spoke to a hundred and fifty thousand North Koreans and the stadium\nYou know essentially it was written by North Korean propaganda is um and so essentially we've got a South Korean president who I don't know what's in his head John but what he's doing is sort of hurting his own freedom his own democracy his own society hit the nation he's supporting his own nation\nAnd so regardless of what he thinks a you know some people say he's a communist some people say worse\nI don't know but I Do know that he's dangerous um to what we're trying to do to disarm the north Koreans into stylish and continue peace and stability in the region moon as an obstacle to that we should treat them like that we should treat them essentially like we treat Kim Jong on which is an adversary\nFinal question garden Fifteen

ceremony swearing in for justice Kevin a social justice Kavanaugh\nThe president to us remarks I Want to apologize to bread and the entire Kavanaugh family for the pain and suffering you've been forced to endure use are under historic scrutiny where proven innocent said Mr Trump so lessons learned for the Democrats and the Republicans David is just back from Tennessee and I wanted to draw upon his\nInformation he did very careful reporting of the voters in Tennessee where there's a tight Senate race David lessons learned from the Kavanaugh matter as you saw it from the distance of the middle of America lessons learned let's start for the Republicans when did they learn about these last three weeks from these last three weeks could even go\nTo John and looking in Senate races which are largely playing out in Republican states where the president is a well thought of\nOr the lesson learned was that this was a good exercise for them it it galvanized the Republican vote and the Republican vote that isn't necessarily the biggest cheerleader of president of it for them this went beyond that and it's sort of awake in the interest in the mid term elections a lot of Republican that you know as\nAs normal when you control everything there's less of a motivation to get out there and vote again with that's just the way it is a angers more galvanized usually but this really angered a lot of Republicans\nAnd and so I think Democrats come out your wars for the where I mean this is what I saw in Tennessee\nAnd talking to people and and observe a um he just had a lot of anger and and a lot of people were telling me or you know at least a few that they're like she'll rather than they thought it was a good governor and who knows maybe they would have voted for maybe they wouldn't have voted at all\nBut the this for them a created a straight tickets for the Republican sort of election Alan house races it it could be a totally ...\nFor the Republican sort of

CNN and the Washington Examiner who look at the midterms in four weeks time\nAnd ask the economy very good economy very very good economy insect so good that even the Federal Reserve thinks it's a good economy and will continue for some quarter is heads in\nAddition Russia gay big story two weeks ago\nLots of anxiety and now the president takes Rod Rosenstein on a ride for air force one so David back from Tennessee did you hear comments about the economy or comments about Russia gate as the voters considered the Senate race in Tennessee\nWell yes I Know I'm a lot of Republicans that I talk to 'em want us to talk about the economy but Kavanaugh was the dominant issue Russia did not really come up with it in fact there really hasn't been an issue over the past several weeks is another good reason why this cabinet fair ended up to be a very good for for\nRepublicans because all of the all of the things that rubs people the wrong way about Trump and and my depressed with the Republican vote or off the table now I I still contend\nThat we've reached the point in the cycle where the economy is a much bigger story for Trump's twenty twenty ... should I think he can win them a lot of votes um that were reluctant Trump votes last time and\nMight even when I'm a few more votes and it's sort of depends on who the Democrats put up\nUm if the economy was going to be the story that you know we might have assumed from from ... from a store a perspective on an economy helping the incumbent party\nI think that would have already been the dominant story the fact that we're still talking about another extraneous story Kavanaugh or as the one that's motivating Republicans and and my level the playing field here tells you what you need to know about its place in his race but in the next grade it can be a very big deal\nIn his race but in the next race it could be a very big deal\nMischief on the economy pocketbooks take home pay if it wasn't there we'd be talking about it it's there so we're not this is not merely a good economy this looks to be a great one\nAnd a great one that is the envy of the world the trade negotiations that are said to be a source of disruption or failure are not damaging the stock market\nIn addition to the fact that the Chinese are having trouble a lot of trouble and it's obvious are having trouble nothing to do with us So Jon is that a factor in the mid term or is it all going to be about Trump\nWell until about was all about Trump\nBecause he was always in the news and the economy was viewed as okay that's fine what have you done for us lately and what are you going to do for us and we'd be future\nI think if the Republicans run a more aggressive campaign and they can keep Trump quiet or at least discipline for the next four weeks what will happen is a Republican attack\nOn what the Democratic House or a Democratic Senate would do to mess up the economy so not so much taking credit for what is done but what threats exist raising taxes more regulation I'm basically a more spending impeachment\nImpeached but which is a distraction that people don't want because they want the Congress to go about the people's business not a partisan obsession\nWith Mr Mr McCotter you have a question quickly gentleman what do we make the Democrats with impeachment are they going to use as a hallmark has Mr nab there seems to be saying or are they going to be more like the Democrats in the Senate butter saying let's not let's back before hasty about this David\nBullock I think what you're going to hear from those Democrats as if they're going to use the the oversight power the Congress and what we know they will do is\nCall up everybody they can have testified before a a house committee they can somehow get them up there and the subpoenas AWOL and by the truckload at the White House from the Democratic a house committee chair but that's what they take the house they're trying\nTo shove this idea of impeachment of the Republican a fantasy that's been made up the scale Republicans and devoting course Republicans don't need to create the fantasy anymore because I got Kavanaugh to to do that job and and the only question is does that last for ten days from now we're we refer to what had been the main of this election cycle\nMr ... [noise] well I agree with David the Democratic officials and consultants don't want to talk about impeachment\nBut their Base Camp help itself as a message that is going getting through a lot of the grassroots is we have to impeach Trump and not just trumpet Kavanaugh and that's what this election is about\nSo the the the overall thirty thousand foot message is responsible and prudent as David says but the message a lot of activists who sending it to digital districts are or we're going to get them and we're going to impeach them and that's one of our signal issue\nDavid I saw a news item in saying that some group and the Democratic party was not going to spend money or ... pulling money back from the the the Democratic race and in Tennessee did you see that was that substantive or just a quick reaction\nWell look I mean it's a major democratic group a part of the I got the one Democrat who speculated they might have done that it just broke bread is a solid or because you know you could give them something to crow about I mean he doesn't need any money so if they're going to pick Brett is into to disown\nThem you know that's fine as far as Democrats are concerned but but it's true that the base has John Fund mentioned\nThe based on the left was all ginned up about this I don't know how much Senate Democrats wanted this is that just like the Obamacare struck down in twenty Thirteen that the Republican base Amanda or at least a portion of it\nThen of course sort of had to take this all the way and this is what happens when you don't have a leader of the party and the ... thinks that you're a minority should be able to do a lot more than I can actually do\nSo you do not believe that President uh Bredesen was hurt by that remark because he's already bought on the TV\nWith anything he'd be a help I mean I run out and say the liberals are just own it\nRight now I've got a they've Devin trucker I recommend is reporting from in the Washington Examiner forests trip to Tennessee John Fund or the national Review Online Thaddeus McCotter W.

through how we\nCan take to Laney America Tonight right after that we go to Bob Ney the former congressman from Ohio from TOP Media news well Bob it in the end of the line as far as that confirmation you and I talked about this for months and ... we say is that right at the very beginning you couldn't imagine he wasn't going to be confirmed\nBut you know all the turmoil that resulted of a protest thing really I think both sides because now it's like sports teams the Democrats and the Republicans why did the Republicans prevail and went to the Democrats do wrong\nFor the Republicans I think made a couple of years I Know everybody Republicans angry at him for the\nK look let's take a look into this I think after that when they came back we haven't seen the report of course but I think we know nothing changed after that\nI think we know nothing changed so after that it was more of a he said she said and nothing you know startling new came out where for example more drugs\nOr the one guy that I'm Dr Ford said was there you know he obviously didn't change his ideas of what happened so as a result I think that you know that helped the Lindsey Graham speech which he just you know\nIt was on fire I think it gave a sort of a psychological momentum frankly for the Republican side and then call just said look we're going to press ahead\nYeah instead of yielding to any pressure so I think frankly you know the fact that they just kept moving and again that FBI report I think really helped what flake called for\nYeah and so now a for Kavanaugh who he moves Donny there's the swearing in ceremony on Monday the president I'm apologizing to Brett Kavanaugh on his family but the terrible pain and suffering\nThat he's they endured after his confirmation Supreme Court for Kavanaugh he just moves on right and just take the high road is that what you would advise him to do and not making comments about this\nCase you raise a great question because in my opinion you and I talked about this uh one of the downsides was his demeanor of just attacking back yeah he you know especially when he turned to the center to the one senator and said have you ever had a blackout drunk yeah\nAnd that to me raised a whole different set of questions also he had friends of his who supported him but he had a different version of that night a different version of how he he drank years ago et cetera so there were some ... holes and everything I think for him\nAnd it's very important he moves on because guess what this isn't done in the sense that he's going to hear the word impeachment impeach Kavanaugh you know if the Democratic side takes control he's going to hear right out front they are going to to begin impeachment processes against him [noise]\nAh and that's going to be monitored used by the Democratic side for this midterm election I Will tell you this I Would bet money\nI mean I'm Sorry you were trying to with than a hundred and some mile an hour when you're not going to win that battle so they have a hurricane warning in effect\nFor that Alabama and there's some of you are listening to us there and in Florida for that Alabama Florida border up to the ah swam the river so so really take this to heart and all on that border to Mississippi Alabama border\nRight there right in that the the beach and it means storm surge heavy rainfall hurricane force when all the things that that entails and most of the people there no I mean this and you know not to fool around with us so there's thirty five counties that have been declared\nAn emergency state of emergency\nBecause that means the funding Florida stake\nTheir clothes their clothes from Tuesday through friday this debt healthier if they're taking it no way to take a chance to make sure all of the students and any of the faculty is nowhere near there because this is right where it could smash\nInto even Alabama governor Kay Ivey said so same thing state of emergency because power outages when damage to pray and the debris is what all that can be so deadly you know when we had to latch hurricane that came through a tree falls down smashes into a trailer house whatever\nOr you've got power that's out people trying to come back in\nSo I think when you look at this too I think people are heating nest for the most part it's actually after they watched what has happened\nEarlier in this hurricane season even Florence with the floods 'cause it's always the flood thing afterwards that you're worried about but it's Michael path boy oh boy I mean it really is coming up through the panhandle\nAnd it could intensify so that's the thing maybe it's the cat three but could ... shift to allow for let's hope not because then you're talking\nA little jump up and the wind miles per hour you know a hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty something\nYou've got five hundred Florida National Guard members who are activated of course because you've got to plan the logistics of it all where are you responding where's everyone being deployed basically when it happens and then five thousand more that are there so\nI mean this is happening fast\nSo fast so that means you know that's why they're clearing the decks in 'em at Florida State because they know that this thing is bearing down quickly and\nThey know that this thing is bearing down quickly and it will strike that panhandle Tuesday Wednesday really Wednesday is probably who you're talking about a storm surge\nFor some of the Florida coastline and twelve feet and some of those low lying areas I mean that's that's deadly is what that is\nSo hurricane season it is I'm telling you it is unpredictable at times I mean predictable least that we have the watches and you can look at the different maps thank goodness much different from those of you listening you get it tornado versus hurricane which is worse I mean it's almost a ridiculous question since I have been in both\nNot the worst of the worst with a tornado the aftermath of a tornado yes\nThe worst of the worst in the middle of a hurricane yes right in the middle of a hurricane I experience with that was like\nWhere you're basically trapped urine locked down\nSo I Love that the cars and I was a kid so I Love that the evacuations really happened and people he them where we didn't used to do that wasn't quite the same thing it doesn't mean that nobody clear it out but not the way they do it now it's much much different\nI Would have said from this hurricane\nInto this New York limo crash I mean\nThe status ever and I it it is one of the deadliest road accidents in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were saying the deadliest you know why twenty people were killed it was over the weekend\nAnd I was watching one of the college football games and I thought it was a mistake I thought\nOh no they must mean that people were injured and a couple of people were killed now we're saying this stretch limousine killed Eighteen people in the limo to people who were walking and it and that's twenty\nSo ah I mean that's terrible and what happened was that this limo went through a stop sign and boom I you know unfortunately just collided and killed the people that were\nIn the limousine and it was um I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked I mean just the worst a victim texted that dilemma within terrible condition\nMinutes before the crash so you had a serious surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board the terrible conditions limo and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happen or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limousine didn't have that this is what's so scary didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate\nThey held a state inspection last month how do you know that right you see the limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever are you asking about that or you digging into that now so they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery so two people were killed you had um\nThe people that were in this limousine you you had um husbands and wives you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was a tech the text message I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo is because there was a last minute replacement after a bus hired to shuttle the group broke down so that the first thing that happened I mean what\nAre you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific because you know in their twenties and thirties\nUm yeah really just really really\nOne of the biggest losses of life and and this is what the first responders thing that they've seen a long time and in just in an instant like that it slammed into to give you the further details on the story it's a dilemma ran a stop sign slammed into a parked SUV and then the two people\nUh you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there them they were hit so it's a\nIt's it's just awful and it does make you kind of think and I don't know why 'cause I got to say what are you doing if you order a limousine you're asking people hating limo company\nHey are they good uh-huh hey I'm One of the people say about the motor on time they get you know are they do they know if they have a federal certificate\n... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people\nIn his limousine [noise] you know maybe I got to ask a few more questions or find something else out about that\nCompany because those people were thinking that they're just thinking I got to be kidding me this first we had this break down then we get in the limousine and this happens and then the worst thing possible\nI mean just absolutely possible happen we've just scratched the surface here in his first hour of America Tonight\nOther things that we're going to talk about include the man cave got baseball playoffs enough football to talk about remember this week of course when I have another nail the score but next what do you think we're going to the mail bag [noise]\nOn America Tonight with me Kate delays [noise]\n\n[noise] one of radio\nABC News I Do Schreiber deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein talking with President Trump on Monday on air force one the president's saying about the conversation quote you had a really good dark we actually get along ABC News cheap one else corresponded Jonathan girl\nThe president has been convinced by some of his advisors did firing Rosenstein in the midst of of the midterms will just be a bad move it would it would open them up to all sorts of avenues of attack\nIt would inject another element into the campaign would not be helpful to Republicans but I think there's a little bit more to it than that to the dirty little secret here is that the president actually has a pretty good relationship with Rod Rosenstein certainly a better relationship at this point that he has with his attorney general Jeff Sessions\nWhat\nSome think is negative because of Kavanaugh Susan Collins to me would be the one\nSeat that sits right there in the middle did you see what you had to say on sixty minutes I did I saw it she said and Heidi Heitkamp it's interesting because I Can't brisk is risked her seat\nAs she is definitely she's a Democrat and I and a Republican area and she voted against Kavanaugh and Susan Collins who has a lot of voters\nWho are independents especially in Maine she voted for Kavanaugh\nAnd there are people that are they've already built up the coffers for money to run against her and what not and I saw both of them on sixty minutes and I you know look I give him credit 'cause\nHeres what they both said in different ways that they they voted the way they thought they should vote and they weren't ... they weren't ... they weren't weighing the politics of it all is what they is what they said and Susan Collins\nSaid that that that she talked to Kavanaugh and the thing that she liked about Kavanaugh she felt that he was about the letter of the law and she felt like he would go by that because she's pro choice and meeting that weighing the law and the precedent and all that kinda stuff um\nAnd she said they're just ... there was no evidence there she said there was not um there wasn't any evidence of of that so she couldn't go in that direction\nBut she certainly is bearing the brunt of a lot of of anger of having to have guards and her people having guards and her family being guarded but this is the same thing with Dr Ford I mean ridiculous lick let's let it go\nEspecially in her case okay it's done it's over with he's confirmed and now they still can't go into their house I mean come on\nThis really like I said we live in America we have different opinions give me a break right\nGive me a break I so um let's move on to something else because we could just go not this all night long or all show long anyway here's\nOne from a Frank who's says\nKate it's so easy to talk about the whole cabinet thing but I Want to jump onto 'em something completely different horrible about that limo crash the twenty people were killed and the fact is they failed their inspection and hey the driver wasn't even licensed\nWow I think there's questions we all need to ask in the future when we rent these things so we don't find ourselves in a death

I wanted to pick up on that right because the the move in ... in the U.S has really been driving a lot of action recently that some people and basically said especially given the fact that we've been in\nAn earnings blackout periods we haven't had a lot of share buybacks we haven't had a lot of announcements to move things otherwise so\nInteresting to me that head of a tenure auction later this week you have to actually tipping a little bit today even though people are suddenly throwing up their hands and saying this is that this is what we thought waiting for well maybe not we're actually seeing a bad\nWell how about that but this is important right because there's a lot of other a lot of ... that are going to be auctioned off and there's a question of the ... where does that come in and it will evidently at three point two percent are a little bit over they're coming in\nAnd that says something I mean especially because you know when we look at three point two percent we haven't seen that in a while so you know there's always the issue when you see all kind of pop up\nIs this the point where investors are going to buy so the idea that they're biting here and they're also fighting at the same time interestingly enough on some of the rate sensitive areas within the stock market utilities notable in that regard I mean it does get\nYour attention well I have to wonder how much can we draw a direct line from the stability we're seeing in the treasury market today and instability that we're seeing in equities I mean like the basically is this\nSort of the fear that yields we're going to rise so much that people would be enticed rotate their money into treasuries to capture the higher yields and out of stocks and and so if you get civility people are sort of happier staying and stuff and you buy that is that what's going on it\nSeems like things have kind of stalled out for the moment though ... and maybe that's enough I mean given that you're going to get numbers later in the week and you've got already some preliminary figures that people are reacting to\nIn that regard I got to mention the PG industries because they talked about higher on material cause higher shipping costs weaker demand in China we're talking about a company makes paints codes that sort of thing\nAnd the Bee Gees down more than seven percent of the themes they're talking about\nA presumably are going to pop up again and again when it comes to what companies have to say about their third quarter results and also about their outlook and it's always the question you know if your costs are going up are you in a position to increased prices enough to cover them\nAnd so that raises the issue of profitability and it's one that we're really going to have to watch ... D jays case it looks like they they haven't been able to do that and and hey Sherman Williams also in the papers are down to ... percent as well so there's been CERN I suppose that ah it's not just the company specific issue\nAt least we got a big week for treasury auctions right I mean they're going to be selling a lot of treasury debt\nYeah two hundred and thirty billion dollars are going to be talking more about that ah cutting up Ira Jersey I also want to get a sense though I just heading into the beginning of earnings driven again friday with some bank earnings that are coming out and Clinton J. P. Morgan I just wonder\nHow good for them that we've seen more uncertainty kind of filter into the market days I mean we have seen a is it the yield curve actually start to steep and a little bit we're starting to see volatility in stocks and bonds picking up is it enough and was it a enough for the third quarter to not be a total bust\nYeah I mean all good questions and you know we'll get a better handle on them once we start seeing those results on friday if only because let's face it third quarter includes the summer months they tend to be relatively slow for markets are certainly this year was was nothing to write home about in terms of price moves or trading so\nYou know there there's a lot to kind of consider in that regard and really maybe it's more an issue of what these companies are going to be seeing for the fourth quarter in into next year you know how their business sort of shapes up especially as rates move higher and puts them in a position to earn more on their loans and investments\nCan I just do a little GE watch just because I think it's our and great I'm dory a GE shares of about a quarter of a percent today\nAnd this is a a move that is consistent with what we saw yesterday as well as on friday and on Thursday and on Wednesday and on Tuesday\nAnd if they're higher today that's the seventh day in a row and the longest streak in more than two years now they have a long way to go to make up their losses in the past few years and that said you know it is a sort of a a vote of confidence for their new\nExecutive Larry ... and you yeah\nAnd Larry Cole indeed yeah right\nYes so you look you look perplexed well\nYes I just want to bring you this news actually us it's time reporting that Nikki Haley\nI resigned as UN ambassador and President Trump has accepted the resignation\nWhich is sort of interesting ... interesting I'm sure we're going to be covering that yeah I mean basically she's been a pivotal person in a lot of foreign policy relationships are with us so it'll be interesting to see what the what the explanation is behind that again this is what ... is reporting\nYes once again the President Trump accepting Nikki Haley's resignation as us UN ambassador now let's go to or not and I want to be as in Washington DC where Nathan anger has more of the national headlines Mason you have him at least I'll be continuing to follow that news out of ... this morning\nUm but we do know that there are set for a a Oval Office meeting between the president and Nikki Haley at ten thirty AM and he just tweeted out there is a big announcement with my friend so the White House is going to some great pains to try to make this look like I'm this is a friendly situation\nSo Kevin can you just give us a sense of how important and pass it around Hailey wise to President Trump is trying to administration and frankly just generally to the country\n[laughter] well I think that she had been seen as someone who was a um a reasonably moderating influence when it came to foreign policy someone who could present a a a more um [noise]\nUh ice melt maybe just a a gentler face to to the rest of the world although she certainly was able to be tough for various points along the way when when she needed to be but um I Do think that this is going to\nProbably um unsettled folks up in the United nations which obviously has already I'm a sort of had trouble sort of figure out how to read and how to deal with the ministry\nKevin any possibility that ambassador Haley will be given another posted in the administration\nAt this point anything is possible uh normally though when these things happen um you know you learn about the new job right away and not not not the word resigns\nSo you don't normally resigned to take a new job you know what I just get promoted to a new job so we're not at this point expecting anything there's obviously been over the years a lot of speculation that Nikki Haley made some ... ... be harboring her own political ambitions\nUm uh but uh it's again given the extent to which there the White House is trying to portray this as a friendly departure um I think we have to look carefully read too much into it right away\nWhat is the relationship if you know about the relationship between a John Bolton the security advisor and ambassador Haley\n[noise] I don't think we know a ton about exactly how well they've they've they've gotten along I'm John Bolton of course is a hardliner hum came in with very strong views of the uh some of which didn't exactly messed with where the president was some of which um mashed are extremely well\nNikki Haley wasn't quite the same sort of hard liner when it came to foreign policy so um I think it was pretty clear that were some level of of policy differences\nI think what it was a little less clear actually is where Trump strict visa through them and and um that might have been a moving target at times a boat and would have had much more ah close access to the president much more frequent access but Nikki Haley was also a frequent presence at the White House\nAll right Kevin Whitelaw we're gonna let you go to continue reporting is that Kevin Whitelaw is head of congressional coverage for Bloomberg News thank you so much for joining us of course we'll be getting more detail is that President Trump tweeting that he's expecting a big announcement at ten thirty AM with his friend investor Nikki Haley any Oval Office\nWe ever had catching live from Bloomberg interactive brokers studios and we want to turn our focus to fixed income

investing\nHum let's bring in Ira Jersey who covers all things interest rates for I hear as she's a rate changes for Bloomberg intelligence I write two hundred and thirty billion dollars of us treasuries being auctioned off this week how concerned are you that they're really will be sort of balances ingestion here\nYeah hey Lisa good morning on yeah so it it's I think today's bill auctions um will probably come and go without too much trouble\nI think the the bigger question is tomorrow so tomorrow we have three or know contend your notes or they're going to be auctioned and given how weak the market's been recently we'll investors show up or will they say hey three and a quarter twenty year old maybe that's not so bad\nOn a second Iraq I Want to stop you right there because if you've got treasury yields in the long and climbing why are you concerned about short term yields when there was a flight to cash and people actually want something that will be a sort of er of all sorts of cash in the near term we're not making any kind of longer\nYeah yeah so I'm I'm not concerned about today's options I think that the table auctions in general will ... will be relatively well received several you know we we've only seen the only time that we've really seen any issues in any of the table options\nSince the Treasury Department had to increase the issue in quite a lot\nWas really the week of the fourth of July weekend and yeah there were a lot of people out that week and that was only one option where there was trouble I I Do think it is tenure notes tomorrow that um that are ... that that could see a little bit more of the pain and death and and give it that we're sitting right out of ...\nThat that could see a little bit more of the pain and death and and give it that we're sitting right at a pretty important technical level at around three and a quarter percent [noise]\nUm I think that that can be very telling the question is how well are people set up with some of the reason why we saw last week's weakness because people knew that there was going to be\nA supply this week and that they you know so futures are they shorted treasuries are they even just made some room in order to buy at these somewhat cheaper levels within their portfolios\nUm you know that being said you know this is going to kind of proved to prove that level if you see we demand if you look at what we called it to cover ratio so ... are there for every bond that's being sold if you see that significantly below two point five\nThen that that's a signal that look we demand is just not keeping up with this bigger [noise] um we went to a larger level of supply that the treasury half the issue because of the increasing deficits\nIra Jersey Thanks very much for being

have presidential aspirations in twenty twenty it's difficult to fathom that Nikki Haley might try to take on President Trump in two years and indeed the\nAmbassador's soon to be former ambassador has said she's focus now on her job but you can't\nHelp but uh you know keep the idea of a political speculation in mind with someone who's risen through the ranks so quickly or you know you just didn't do the last few years in from a governor of South Carolina or to joining the president's cabinet just shortly after he was inaugurated\nSo Nathan is that the reason why this is such a big story today is it because people are speculating that Nikki Haley is going to run for president in twenty twenty against President Trump or is it because she herself held such an important role in his cabinet and as a sort of representative of the United states to the United nations\nThat her position that will be crucial to fill with another person who could potentially shape the lessons reputation with the rest of the world\nBut I think it's important to whenever I have turnover in the cabinet and indeed within the administration itself I mean there's been so much attention on turnover within the White House the difficulties the President Trump\nHas had keeping people in top positions\nAre just a few months ago after a ... letting a secretary of state Rex Tillerson go via tweet to the president said that he was close to getting the cabinet he wants and Nikki Haley in her tenure as UN ambassador has tried to ... pretty closely\nTo this president and to ... you know put a forceful a face on the Trump administration's foreign policy it is going to be very interesting to see who the president might turn to now or as his face at the world body or it's just a few months as the president now says that Haley will be leaving ... years and\nYes Nathan just to follow up on that you know of any potential applicants are people that would like the job but from the administration you know it's\nReally hard to say at this point Pam I mean ah you know Nikki Haley has been such a strong voice or at the un maturing U.N Security council meetings\nI'm pulling the U.S out of the human rights council of you know being a stronger voice in terms of alliance with Israel or in contrast to so many other countries within the global body very difficult to say at this point or who the president might be thinking who might be next in line\nTo take over his unit ...\nNathan ... thank you so much for being with us from the radio hosts are joining us from the studios and watch\nSpecial report Nikki Haley resigns breaking news this hour United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley is out of the Trump Administration details were sketchy but we know that President Trump has accepted her resignation ambassador Haley reportedly informed her staff this morning\nThe timing of her departure is unclear but Haley former South Carolina Governor is currently in the west wing of the White House and we're expecting her to appear with President Trump at any moment so we should be getting more information soon\nHaley has had a tougher stance toward Russia than the president and differences on other issues about correspondent Elise law but tells us she was able to maintain independence\nIn some ways the president let her do some of the things that she thought were very important like I traveled with her to Africa to visit refugees South Sudan Ethiopia the Democratic Republic of Congo she outages disdain in Syria and turkey\nAgain UN ambassador Nikki Haley has resigned and is about to face cameras with

shaping up right now so I don't know of today is the day a work tomorrow is the day but as I look out at the market over the course of the next month or so\nThere are several positive catalysts that I think will reverse this recent weakness a you've got corporate earnings starting later this week including Mr diamonds from\nI'm expecting his company is going to produce some pretty good numbers along with others were thinking the corporate earnings are going to be twenty percent plus for the large caps this quarter a we've got the a flash report from the Commerce Department on third quarter GDP which will be out I Believe October twenty six\nWe've got three point four percent is our number federation or I think the Atlanta fed for example might have a four handle on their number and then we were the midterms are going to be over in a month and and all of this noise and nonsense will be behind us there will be some certainty yeah right\nReally ever going to quote sure on on that one I I Want to ask you a more a more uh everyday question ...\nSo far this month the S. and P. five hundred as down a little bit more than one percent what is the number based on your experience where the customer and the client starts calling\nWill uh you know that becomes more of a technical question or anything else so so typically\nHim the third quarter\nOf a midterm election year a year like this tends to be a really sloppy quarter well the month of September ... ah we're up seven percent or something in the month of September it was the best\nMonth we've seen in like five years or something like that or\nNumbers have been strong um I like to look more peaks to troughs and and this little correction that we're seeing in large cat market right now is about three or four percent in the small cat market is about seven or eight percent these are healthy corrections\nBecause when it comes declaring financial hurdles you don't have to you by a A R B\n[noise] talk on the radio\nAnd three

spoke with\nGovernor Scott to everybody that you have to do and I I think that ah hopefully we'll get lucky but maybe that won't happen but we're prepared\nDo this because Nikki\nThe United nations has been very special\nTo the United nations has been very special to me she's an incredible job shoes a fantastic per se is very important play but she also\nIs somebody that gets it and she has been\nAt the United nations from the beginning with us from\nWar with us or against gay and it's been really very intense and she told me probably just wants to go she said you know maybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period for the other they're\nGoing to take a little time off of that is she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina\nFor eight years and then she uh\nShe did this and this is possibly but more in tune with what's going on\nIn very dangerous and a lot of things which used on the bench as their job and we've done a fantastic job together we saw a lot of problems or one of the process of solving problems at the beginning of North Korea was a mess\nReally nicely I can speak for\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is things in the world\nMickey and so we're all we're all happy for you and one way\nThere'd be a different professor you can have your ... but uh I just wanted to let you do so at the end of the year Nikky will be leaving and they will be in Johnston touch I Know that whenever you have an air there's you\nThat was really the thing I think she did that said the United nations you got to know the players and she got to know China Russia India she knows everybody all the very first day basis and they're like ... or maybe you're\nMore likely but they say do they really like another thing maybe more importantly there is a sector\nSo they just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss you nevertheless so you do the\nJob but I Want to say\nI Want to say on the first of all I Want to thank or just you know allowing us\nIt has been\nLeave his days that race and\nThat matter most excited look\nWith the United states on foreign policy now\nWe do they respect\nDo they know that if we say we're going to do something we fall for it when\nThat whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries\nI mean whether to the trade deals were given amazing they said the part\nThe gifts these two years it'd be when we got one point\nMade a stronger we made it more efficient South Sudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time\nAnd generation done in a way that we can really\nTo the world that every country needs to understand you can't overlook all the bad thing they're doing do you have to see them for the threat that they are I think you look at the anti Israel bias and the strength and courage that the president showed in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we\nAnd you know all those things has made a huge difference in the U.S can\nA U.S again any what they're doing in a way that should make all American very proud and I do\nFamily in general and the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me um\nSay enough good things about Jared ... guy\nIt in such a genius that no\nI mean to redo the now to be on the way he did um what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done an of August\nAnd they do a lot of things for high or things that I Wish more people knew about because we're about our country because they're in a Methodist minister and also just have to say I'm certainly thank you my family\nYou know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um\nLeaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good flakes and\nPart of the team now\nI'm going to go I think that um the main thing when I was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane thousand\nChurch shooting a school shooting there was a lot\nIn and do your years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense\nTime and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have\nWants to know when you step aside\nShe is in\nLifetime and I will say that's um for all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for Johnny twenty I can find a shoe and I'll be doing as campaign or that's one so I'll look forward to supporting the\n\nTo leave behind this is a really personal decision\nYou've been away from your letters or\nVery supportive so

make sure\nIt was a blessing to go into the UN was body\nAnd I always do that I'll never truly\nAnd his friends are what make you know to do\nWell [noise] I think he's going to be saved till the end of the\nWhich will be just about two years and I just think and I was just she says as Mickey was making I was thinking when we came into\nWas almost inevitable in the minds of many that we're going to war with North Korea to view this President Obama I'm sure he'll tell you that that was by far is biggest problem when we set them back right here\nGot to make it into words we've got a benefit also [laughter]\nI guess the question [laughter]\nI just want to finish because this was really the reason for this was Nikki\n[laughter] just to give my on behalf of the country I Want to be [noise] much everyone [laughter]\nAll right you're listening to President Trump and Nikki Haley speaking about her resignation as UN ambassador\nThat President mentioned how Haley approached him about six months ago about the possibility to take some time off is that Haley has done an incredible job and his administration will really missed her we didn't hurt from Haley herself pushed as serving as UN ambassador has been an honor the lifetime and commented how the UN since respected on a global scale\nShe also said she thought that shouldn't be the right time to step aside and let someone else take on the role\nHaley will be leaving at the end of the year and insured everyone she will not be running in twenty twenty President Trump believes he won't even successor within the next three weeks and

at the end of this year after two years on the job speaking in the oval office Hitler sent her decision was not because of personal political ambitions\nCrawl in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for Twenty one I'll be going as fast forward to supporting the\nBlair labor to Bloomberg News national security editor joins us now from our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studios in Washington for more on this story and Larry ... what do you make of it\nWell it's either as a surprise list some ulterior motives involved\nOr it's not\nA you know Nikki Haley boys that she's been there two years a that is a fairly long a ten year for a UN ambassador a however uh why announced it now three months before she got to leave before the midterm elections so um I Would note that in her volunteering\nBut no I Am not running for twenty twenty\nOr she didn't say that you needed to do what you didn't say I'm not running in twenty twenty four so there's always an undercurrent that she has a political potential that she has political ambitions and that there's some sort of calculation about her future even though she says she takes it as it comes\nNow the president said that she talked to him about this about six months ago on the other hand uh we had words that are the decision ... the White House chief of staff John Kelly and vice president Mike Pence how could that be\nWell yes and we have heard that uh so the question is you know this discussion\nOr six months ago it would've been you know I Will stay forever but I'm happy to serve you it it sounded idling is she exactly gave a departure notice to the president even from her own own account\nAnd so that's why there's this this question of whether um there's a calculation uh she said it's not for personal reasons that her family loves being in New York one ... is she going to continue to be based there I'm Ed Ed even though she's going to lose that\nA un apartment a but a lot for personal reasons so there are the questions about her future and her political future um\nYou have to ask a since she's always said that on\nNon of foreign affairs non un issues she's given the president's her view her the president her views privately um if they're out there are questions about ... whether there's a whole new to a issue which he does uh personally feel strongly about\nFactory in her decision to leave 'em she didn't criticized the president on the cabinet nomination or otherwise again she says she talked to him privately\nBut might that be something that comes up in her um oh say a memoir she writes before she runs for president or in the future\nSo who will replace her well\nOf course the speculation is already off and running a one a quick uh assumption has been specially administration with too few women in major positions that Dina Powell the former Trump adviser who's at Goldman Sachs or might be a perfect candidate for it\nUh one candidate who I think is eager to have him self than the running is Rick grown now the U.S ambassador to Germany hum who's spent a good deal of time as a U.S spokesman at the un\nI'm so there are contenders already being talked about uh and uh it will see the president said he's going to\nSolve this in the near future but he's got a lot of things on his plate and he's going to have a lot of turnover because that's inevitable um as he a in a two year mark\nNow several senior White house aides\nA have a voice some concern to Bloomberg about the timing of\nHer decision weeks before the midterm congressional elections and indeed New Jersey's Bob Menendez the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is already trying to make hay out of this he calls Haley's resignation yet another sign of the Trump administration's chaotic foreign policy\nShe has backed president on ... on policy abroad not always that home she has backed him on\nBacked president on ... on policy abroad not always at home she has backed him on policy abroad she has been in some ways a particularly eloquent spokesmen for on Israel uh on North Korea at the un and at the same time uh conveyed the toughness a Trump wants a so\nThe president made a point of saying this one deserves an Oval Office conversations I like it looks like a very friendly send off\nA one area that we might see some speculation on is whether she isn't getting along with John Bolton the national security advisor simply because um he had a history at the un he is very openly anti un and he may have felt for all of her up\nA strong remarks in positions that the UN that she wasn't tough enough and there could have been tension there\nThan in ... seconds ... can we expect any major change in U.S policy with regard to the un with her departure\nWell again I think the only question will be whether she has moved off some of the rough edges she sometimes talk the president and others into I'm not going into all out assault on the un ah and its members some of that hard edge may or may a surface in whoever replaces\nAll right Larry labor Bloomberg News national security editor thank you for your insights coming up on Bloomberg Politics policy power and law with Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court ... court all eyes are turning to White House counsel Don McGahn as he plans to exit but before we get to all that here's\nWhat's to check on the national news about thank you Peter and as we've been talking about President Trump says he has accepted the resignation of UN ambassador Nikki Haley seated side\nWork in getting the ... of the president's nominees confirmed not only to the Supreme Court but also to the lower court trying to think that mostly met President Trump's legacy probably several generations\nHe is seen as one of the architects um Trump's success in that area I Want to go into just a little bit about the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation because according to the New York times McGahn made sure that some relevant questions were not explored in the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd uh because of quote potentially disastrous for Kavanaugh's chances of confirmation was outside his legal authority as White House counsel\nNo it would have been perfectly appropriate\nFor the White House and as a general matter would come through the White House counsel to um get parameters to the FBI in terms of the breath of their\nExamination uh uh otherwise uh you know but if you're operating under a a strict time prime show I Would say no matter how much they can be political consequences\nTook him in that kind of direction and I don't know exactly what happened ... ... what the direction was but\nObviously some of the political tolerance might claim that uh that direction given by the White House and made it would have made it more difficult to uncover anything that would have been negative about Brett Kavanaugh but asked whether or not that happened and it was awful you know I I I have no idea\nTurning now to Robert Mueller's investigation McGahn met with special counsel Robert Mueller's team for some thirty hours in the Russia investigation which caused more of a risk with Trump once he required to do so and were there any restrictions on what he could say\nOr was he required I Would say probably required uh uh if you're talking about personal conduct a personal wrongdoing by the president uh yeah Don McGahn ... again is not the lawyer for Donald Trump Don McGahn is a government lawyer\nAnd therefore yes he would be expected to come to cooperate with the special prosecutor when I was White House counsel\nWedding investigation connection to valid claim investigation\nAnd I'm a I told President Bush out what's on his lawyer I helped him get a private lawyer and when I was asked by special counsel path is Gerald to provide information I voluntarily set before the grand jury\nAgain because I don't represent I don't ... the council does not represent the president and your government lawyer and it's a government lawyer you have an obligation to cooperate fully with investigation by the department of justice\n... Trump has indicated several times that he sees the FBI and the Justice Department as working for him do you think he understands the concept of no attorney client privilege when he's talking to Don McGahn\n[laughter] I don't know what he understands understand uh the limits of privilege obviously he's not a lawyer [noise]\nOne of the first things that I did when I became White House counsel a and dealing with a non lawyer President George W Bush's we would have these kind of conversations about [noise]\nAbout legal issues the legal authority to the president legal protections that the president we talked about the kind of judicial philosophy that he might think about it can actually would make an appointment so I'm One of the responsibilities I think of a white White House counsel a good one\nTo have these kind of conversations with the president or as an initial matter so that there's no misunderstanding about the scope of privilege are protections\nA matter of it there's no misunderstanding about the scope of privilege of protections that a president might have with respect to his both official and unofficial conduct\nCan you explain as White House counsel at some point you may be giving advice that the president doesn't want to hear you have to keep a certain good working relationship with the president or or you know you should leave the posed\nA obviously a good working relationship is important and makes you more effective but you have an obligation to be truthful and\nAnd uh be complete and your advice chicken president than yes or a time when I was saying that's present that you know we we don't believe you have any legal authority to do this\nNow as a as a legal matter as a constitutional matter the president of the executive branch can override the advice of the council can override it by the attorney general and make a decision as to what is it Michael position\nFor the for the executive branch now there are serious political consequences and doing so as a general matter you want the press United States following the advice of the council and fairly\nFollowing me by the attorney general because it is when when that decision is made by the

killed just trying to make sense of everything that's happening over there in the United states we were in the midst of taping our\nWeekend Business Week show when those headlines started coming across that Nikki Haley not sure exactly what to make of what happens next and we didn't candidly get that much from the president in the oval office about the whys and the next\nNow right as this is Kevin ... really who covers the White House for the hair on the TV side\nAnd Bloomberg got news and it was interesting it was a bit of a surprise it sounds like she had made a given a heads up to the president that maybe she'd be looking to leave but nonetheless it seems like some of the staffers ever at the White House for like a wait\nA minute wait what what I thought was interesting and I don't know if you saw on the actual press conference I just saw a clip of that\nUh Harry meeting with the president uh making the announcement talking to reporters\nAnd she was asked you know like a politics 'cause she hasn't been shy in terms of her political ambitions she did say no I'm not running in twenty twenty she say she campaigned for the president but I think there's a lot of speculation about you know the different parties looking up and lining up\nA future candidate size feeling the bench if you well and she seems like a a logical last person to do that\nWell in one piece of a speculation that I heard here in the London newsroom term one of our smart colleagues here was if Lindsey Graham goes to take a job in the in registration then there's a Senate seat open in her home state of South Carolina so we'll see how this all plays out they got the boys\nThere I got the blanket what am I tried stories had to do it they'll actually taking a position in star back so we're going to dig into that a little bit later on but let's just take the bigger broader picture of the market still live in the markets editor at Bloomberg News cast and would you miss coming up at four pm last time\nOn Bloomberg TV right next to me on my right on my last day will sit and sex editor Bloomberg News better the Mayor Bloomberg interactive brokers today and what are you finding interesting today doubt\nWell the market is a little more mild than it has been in\nRecent days across the board I'm really interested actually some economic data that came out this morning\nYou know you strip away the noise issue for the headlines how is the core economy doing and it's still looks good we got a red book same store sales which is a weekly tracker\nOf retail that's basically at its highest level since the crisis continuing to accelerate which means what people are shopping people are shopping yeah and then we got a ... small business optimism survey\nWhich is a really good for ah getting into the guts of business they're seeing really great a sales continuing to have a hard time fire hire a hiring\nWorkers which is a good time for the labor market so\nYou know you look for cracks right in the economy where other changes as the slowdown is inflation accelerate it gives the consumer a trench views of the things you'd want to look for our business is showing they're going to invest less so for not seeing them\nAnd Dave Wilson narrow range Joe mentioned it what is that said to you\nAbout uh the mood of the market\nWell basically it's a lot of people waiting till you get third quarter results and you know they start to trickle in and the next couple of days really friday\nIs arguably the kick off because you have three of the four biggest financial companies reporting a Citigroup J. P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo so you know there's a lot to look forward to and there was a lot for companies to live up to as well and then you run through the numbers the weak compound here in Bloomberg\nAnd you've got animal is looking for something like twenty per cent profit growth out of the U.S in the five hundred for the third quarter\nOn revenue growth of seven and a half percent so when you put that altogether\nI mean it's not quite the numbers that we saw the first half that sense still it's it's on the high side and companies have to be able to deliver not just those uh projections but as far as what they have to say on the fourth quarter and it's for next year I mean clearly people are going to be looking ahead\nAh with the effects of the terrorists were a whole lot of companies in terms of their business and other costs going up a perfect example came up today with the PG industries begin pace and ... ... they're talking about higher on material cause they're talking about increased shipping rates\nWeaker demand and trying to put that altogether you've got the worst performers ... five hundred the stocks down ... points six percent\nIn the preliminary third quarter numbers out of the company didn't live up to an analyst for looking for do we care at all\nTo that ... a bunch of great stories and the Bloomberg just taking a look at the market environment they talk about the effects are climbing is not just ... percent in the past three day or three days at its future covers inferred in each of the past two sessions is that something is follow Jody ... sometimes\n... you know typically the VIX goes up on the market goes down and often times we when we're talking about the VIX we're really just talk about a sell off but the shape of the futures curve is interesting because that does apply sort of acute near\nTerm risk and we've seen very intense sell off in the past ... following some of these effects some Vicks futures inversions are but you can sort of in a way that it is a greater signal a than to fix itself which often just as a sort of inverse of stocks\nIn Israel is still in its range for the past few months anyways I moved up a few days it certainly hasn't done anything exceptional by recent standards\nRight and nothing like we saw during the financial crisis or are there after January February when fallen out of bed\nYeah I mean it does just feel a little bit calmer around here although Davis you alluded to earnings you know still on the horizon here and I feel like we're going to start to eat at least get some speculation about what those earnings Wilmington I Know it's something we're going to be talking to just about every guest\nUh who comes on who manages money that what they need to see to make them more confident or\nMore cautious and it's clear that people are on the lookout for disappointments that they have an effect\nI'll tell you in an area where it showed up today container board so we're talking about current board that sort of thing I mean you had demo capital markets come out and talking about how they're expecting supplies of this container board in Greece and cutting ratings on the biggest companies that industry\nAnd that would explain three of the sharpest declines in the U.S in the five hundred west rock down seven to ... percent\nPacts corporate America down seven point seven percent their national paper down five point three percent off of that one call so you know people were concerned about where the cracks or especially with the economy having grown for as long as it has consistently as it has\nAlready ... markets ended up pulling back newscaster vitamins check it out at four pm Wall Street journal Bloomberg TV and Davis and I stopped center at Bloomberg News to lay back along with his chart and stock of the day let's get to the buyer day Jason [noise] All right\nSo today's number Carol it's one billion dollars ... billion dollars\nAnd nice round number Netflix buying it first production studio ... studios in New Mexico\nIt's a nice round number Netflix buying it first production studio a B. keys duty as a New Mexico to accommodate it's growing output of original movies and TV shows as a result Netflix said it will create up to a thousand jobs of the year and spend a billion on production\nOf the next ten years New Mexico offering tax incentives to attract production and to get it a state in the city of Albuquerque will provide Netflix at fourteen point five million and sunny Jason we keep talking about this in the magazine I Know best quest for content\nQuest for content which is leading to a quest for talent and that's certainly something to keep an eye on you know who's talented Bob ... yes and he's got some well the national headlines were sending it over to him and the Bloomberg eleven three others are about\nThank you very much Jason and Carol ... who is perhaps President Trump's favorite foil\nUm you know she she made clear that it's not she's not leaving because she wants to run for any office in twenty twenty but there's always been a lot of speculation about her political future swirling around\nShe says she needs a break she was governor of South Carolina twice she's had what are you know anyone would admitted to very intense hears a at the un um so I don't think this is the last we are going to see her\nShe'll break before maybe she runs in four years\nOr possibly yeah it's a I said she's always she's a very savvy a politician she's done very well and this administration where a lot of people have you know found themselves are on the on the wrong side of of of the White House that hasn't been her\nSo um I I think she has some sort of a future in politics I just don't know at this point what it will be\nWell let's talk about that very point or you know sort of navigating her way to this White House because she gave that leads to public impression that she was willing to stand up to the president yet a lot of times people who actually end up to the president\nDon't stare so well what was the secret to her success as best you can tell from talking to folks down their bill\nYou know everyone would like to really know you know what how she managed that relationships you know she made it clear after the Charlottesville shooting last year that she had a personal conversation with the president to talk about his response\nUm she has said that um you know when she took the job it was on\nOn the agreement with President Trump that she be able to speak out on issues of national important so um she had that deal going into the job and it's something that she did from time to time she uh you know when we saw a ... a women are accusing the president\nA of a sexual misconduct we saw Nikki Haley on T. V. show saying women need to be heard we need to listen to what the what they have to say and and then way you know the evidence um which is you know not the straight pro Trump blind that I think a lot of the president or um maybe better known defenders would've taken so\nShe she always seem to have a degree of autonomy it may have helped her in some ways to be away from the White House to be running this\nYou know running the show at the un where she proved herself to be pretty effective and carrying out the president's priorities\nWhat's interesting down get very early on choose that's impressive and early in the ministry where he made some joke or something about like holding on to your job and they don't like you'll get ready to you or something like ... like he played with him somehow I feel like I don't know whether she was the adult\nYou know any administration or something but you did seem to be able to kind of deal with it move on and rise above that\n[noise] that that's right and you know the the the job was pretty politically fraught I mean this is not an administration that on a surface with a look very favorably at the un and then you might even put someone that you consider to be not an insider\nIn that job because maybe it's just not important to you I think Nikki Haley um partly because of international events like North Korea and the Iran deal and uh and the focus on Israel made it made it you know a ... a politically significant\nA job and she was also savvy in the sense that she brought a she brought the whole Security Council down to meet the president the tour of the White House at one point that was the kind of move that you know no one else had really done before and it it got I think I got the president somewhat invested in her success at the un\nWell and not to read too much into the tea leaves here but you know given what she said specifically about Jared Kushner of course the son of the president I called him an underappreciated genius or something of that are sort I that\nPresumably might help her as well and it's a very deft a political move in its own right feels like\nOf course anytime you're sitting next to the president in your in your heaping praise on his daughter and son in law to hurt you also look at the fact that they had this you know kind of send off in the oval office yeah very I I have a hard time thinking of any other top aide to the president who left on those kinds of terms I'm\nWith you know ... basically in an Oval Office for a while and now she's going to be in the job a few more months I'm going to be a busy few months with midterm elections in Iran sanctions and things like that [noise] but yeah it I think it's a sign of her influence\nUh with the president directly that she ...\nI think it's a sign of her and pull and [noise] uh with the president directly that she got that kind of departure\nAmazing well will be a interested to see what happens next me one bit of speculation around the water cooler here in London from knowledgeable you know not knowledgeable watchers was\nIf you see Lindsey Graham become attorney general then there's an open Senate seat in South Carolina her home state so that sort of match a nation I find intriguing as well to\nMake as bill ferries national security team leader for Bloomberg joining us from our bureau always good to talk to you\nAnd if they get right Jason I mean a couple of years into an administration there are some people may be who are worn out who are part of the campaign process and just you know we see things change however we've had a lot of people leave very early on in this administration so it does feel like it's a little bit different but that may be changing of the guard for the next couple of years\nWe shall see it definitely is an interesting movie that has\nA lot of people's attention a lot more to come on that story and much more clear on\nMine number two does not look like a number two I don't know what
