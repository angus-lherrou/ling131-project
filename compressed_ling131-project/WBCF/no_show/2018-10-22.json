nervous a little bit nervous and also a trip to your home town Atlanta and interesting gubernatorial race a heating up and what we really determining teasing it has to do with demographics and who gets to vote plus Rolls Royce\nOff road this was not a story I saw coming who knew they were making an SUV that's in our pursuit section but first\n\nWe can come back we're talking about this week Jason it's a luxury brand well known has had about three years of falling profits but now looks like the tide is turning they missed a few trends and that included the social media wave\nYet who knew that the answer to this problem in stuff here's Stephanie Baker\nThey had a bit of a perfect storm you you might say I'm In twenty Fifteen slowdown in China head\nPartly driven by a crack down on corruption and lavish gift giving which impacted a lot of luxury companies and that was the same time that\nI think the luxury fashion industry really changed and I'm Instagram took over as the main trend setter in terms of determining what fashionable taking over a role held by vogue and el uh for many many years and it was at this point that taught\nThought it should have realized is now it should have started embracing all things digital post a\nCoordinated social media campaign as well as rolling out a online a shopping e commerce sites globally\nAnd I think both things really kind of held them back\nIn the past year they've really gotten their act together are taking social media much more seriously I'm having a certain rolling out on a global network of commerce site selling their whole collection on line and I am really getting caught up to where the rest of the laundry industry is now what I find\nIs interesting too and you point this out in your story Stephanie's you say you know Prada you think about them as a brand they were always several steps it felt like I had some of the other luxury brands when it came to trends and so on and so forth so it's kind of surprising that they missed this trend is social media trend\nIt is um you know and I think it it's hard to determine exactly why that is both a new product\nAnd if you if you you know take a step back this is what China has tried to do in other parts of the technology industry you know sort of encouraging the manufacturers to get into like sort of developing their own intellectual property and and basically trying to to take this model of transitioning from a a sort of\nLower and kind of manufactured to actually developing actual intellectual property this is part of a bigger macro Chinese effort as you say\nTo really in malls and expand the economy yeah and you know when you when you turn the clock back to sort of like two thousand three two thousand for when you want in Moscow starting space acts\nThis was like a really really moved by NASA to to put a little bit of money behind these\nRocket companies because what they were trying to do is lower launch costs at the time was a very expensive to to send pretty much anything into space so they they gave these kind of experimental contracts to Iran mosque and some other people including Jeff Bezos to launch stuff into space that low cost\nAnd it's been incredibly effective I mean SpaceX has has you know enormous market share something like fifty percent of the lunch market because\nThey're so cheap and because you know telecommunications is it sort of industry of strategic interest every country you know China can get its own launch costs down that'll be a huge thing for for for their economy and\nAnd probably for their you know defense interests and you know they're the strategic position well and as you say really positioning itself in the market as one of the only big alternatives to space Texas yeah we we saw recently the uh the the Russians who had been a major player in in federally launches are basically getting out of the market\nFocusing more on sort of space services designing satellites and stuff because they can't compete\nWith the Chinese and and with you on much\nOn the the other thing that's interesting is these are some SpaceX close in China but they're also SpaceX clones in the U.S and so it's not as if the Chinese are the only ones who've decided this is a good idea we're seeing this you know kind of a worldwide it's interesting\nYou talking about Iran not so much I mean he's pretty popular in China is kind of got this cult personality and everybody's saying off none mosque has panic company he can do this maybe we can do it you know\nI'm not sure that these companies are going to pan out it's very hard to get to orbit it it should be emphasized that their progress compared to SpaceX is pretty limited\nUm but you know the the the amount of money that that's been put in so far is not that it's not that much it's you know a hundred million dollars here there which sounds like a lot but when we're talking about launch vehicles were talking in the billions of dollars so if one hands out that could be you know huge for China I mean space ... really has\nEmerged as one of the most dominant companies\nIn a whole new market to you know this is totally around the corner a lot of well yeah and and the big if you've been following you around Moscow over the last year you know it's it's been all that tests all about his weird you know Twitter habits and and and that sort of thing space ... is pretty much an unqualified success I mean we don't\nAnd and that sort of thing space ... is pretty much an unqualified success I mean we don't yet know what they're sort of\nBalance sheet looks like we don't quite know if they're if they're launches are profitable but what they've been able to achieve our last you know twelve years or so has just been remarkable especially because\nYou know one reason that SpaceX is so cheap they're they're they're heavy launch vehicles something like sixty million dollars or are there falcon nine which was their their work horse\nIs because it's reusable so they they've been able to do this thing where they they launched the rocket\nThe rocket drops a satellite off and then it lands on the ground and that cuts cost you know enormously that's something that nobody thought was possible it's something that the Chinese can't do the Russians can't do a everybody's working on it but but that's the reason that that China wants to to get into space race because SpaceX has really been able to achieve some\nKind of remarkable technological breakthroughs\nYou're talking about a race to doesn't the Chinese government to their kind of letting all these companies percolate and then they're going to kind of maybe like ticket sales in one wrap them in terms of launching satellites and so on\nWell that's kind of how it goes in China I mean it it should be said though the aerospace industry is very much something that's like we're governments are playing a role I mean a Texas big clients or the U.S government so if you're watching is you know maybe from the Chinese point of view\nYou know I I'm not sure it's that different from space ... what's kind of interesting here is you have some some of these kind of newly rich\nA Chinese tech entrepreneurs putting putting money into these rocket companies liaison who's the founder Zhao me is the ... of this thing called I space which is you know it's clearly like a a sort of space acts like a story and and when you look at the investor base and everything you know it looks like a a sort of Silicon Valley rocket company insofar as there is such a thing\nAnd we have seen that movie before living that movie right now with and you look at who the big players and that sort of global space race are and we talked about them at the top it's ... it's my skits Richard Branson who you know has really emerged as a major player here especially if you're from a like tourists perspective\nIt well yeah for sure a branch of Virgin Galactic but I think the basic story is very interesting because they are in some ways way behind SpaceX I mean they have not yet gone to bed\nBut what they've done sort of below orbit in terms of like launching vehicles and landing them and um you know getting buy in from the the industry and everything has been pretty impressive so is it it's a situation where where space acts developed in this kind of incremental way we might see blue origin the debate us company\nJust sort of take off excuse the metaphor or you know very quickly\nGoing back to China for a moment I mean this is also a big shift from that living away from kind of a commodity manufacturing of cell phones and TV's where I kind of anybody can do it and trying to be much more high tech\nYeah and I don't think we know how good they are going to be it is yeah but I mean one thing about space acts is\nEarly on especially they were not developing lots of new technology was more about optimizing figuring out how to make these rockets a efficiently and cheaply and that's something that China has been historically very good at it it's it's not a question of you know huge innovation that it's like\nHow can we make you know Fifteen or twenty of these rockets a year at the lowest possible price\nBack ... thanks thanks\nYeah let's think of Bloomberg Businessweek coming up Stacey Abrams maybe about to make history in Georgia but first she's got

back right to your voice that listen Bradley you've gotta you've got to lay off the sauce before you start to perform and just do a lot of the oldest do again this is Douglas movie I mean that was barbecue guy I'm here with the limit themselves David ... yes a good day to use or well I just wanted to say that we're not having\nThat character whoever that is barbecue guy I Will prevail there was a pre recorded intro by a gentleman by the name of a Bradford wells character you created yes and barbecue guy who's to say you arrived but we we\nFor wells character you created yes and barbecue guy it was the ... but we we created and barbecue guy you know I a voice and uh just thought it was time\nTo take a moment out of the day at a bar fifty two shows a year that are all new we never do rerun and explain\nWhat's up with these characters were are they coming from why do we do characters a is a very good response or a bad response with the characters um 'cause once in a while you do hear a strange voice and naturally stranger than our voices\nThat's true once in a while\nAnd so what do we take liberties taken changes and expanding our creativity for use of uh the radio to explore and have some fun creating scene scenarios improved characters settings and voices so I don't know this is our time together exploit why we do it\nIs it effective and is or our characters making radio fun again let's just do where it came from my influenced so this is Bob and ray they were on the radio I Would say I think from the\nThirties or forties or fifties or sixties in the seventies so they were on the radio for fly on the almost as long as we've been on a just to get an idea this is what they did and this is something we don't hear on the radio anymore\nAny skates any voices really for the most part and it used to be very popular but he was Bob and ray doing their thing see see if we uh stock up\nHe jus mean this is going to be a lonely corner of the movie thought isn't about ideas you have all that good I like some of those ... concerns why she came up I mean we have a a regular show I cooked shown on the release of to the theaters was movie\nOh as possible and you know this is ... brains in a very that's higher and finally at a tree oh ... well we have a beard\nAnd a lot of his production doesn't live as it is a you know at first glance kind of a ... or ... or ... them or\nIs it is it's a\nIt's a subject for ridicule definitely caves\nEvery day they would do a five minute soap opera called Mary backstage noble wife those are five voices done by two people you tell me is the first time you're that\nI don't know how could you tell that did this ... that I couldn't distinguish one from the other [laughter] it really really good they don't need a change in the early ... barely ... hung lazy and I talk I have all the other guy or by what they would have a ...\nUh sometimes when you hear these strange voices under the oldest do again what's going on besides the other standard kind of shows we do a little unexpected\nAnd that ... that kind of came out of voters riffing on there once and you you really liked it and you kept you kept requesting to hear his voice and uh well yeah 'cause I that you know what that might have been the first time we broke it out\nThat was definitely the first time was Hercules show maybe I maybe I uh seven show in rifle half hour show is that we were doing\nAnd I just remember the old movies like you know he didn't Casablanca you know you get that voice over coming in where they ... through the ... dry wins and marched on and on and on\nFoot Casablanca not many people do it the way you do it I Know and I just said you know and let's break it up because you were supposed to scheduled in that show just to read that ... you know sort of however and it's too dry and it's just we're on the radio let's have some fun there is some power behind\nNot seeing the voices and again we're not trying to disguise the voices but to put different accents and turns to it I think it's pretty fun uh we did that once we experimented there's another just came out of nowhere we were doing a show on a big a BF gee\nBeing friendly giant right and we were talking about getting big in getting small different movies or do that kind of stuff to different movies and TV shows and so we just ripped into first David getting really small and then I got really big\nIf you're a So Frank and loud and it's kind of risk furlough oh you do [laughter] you sound like the fly you sound like a David his email [laughter] alright alright ... says this is horrible for you it really is horrible for everyone listening is now can you walk around or will you be stepping on the line just stuck\nTo the poll a little hard right now for the call for now\n[laughter] the technology ... to create the large person in the small person it's just it's unprecedented\nGet pretty much put we put out like I don't know a hands or a mouse I think is what we are yeah [laughter] and then a little better there but but again John Hope we're enjoying it if you're not let us know but this was\nJust explaining use some times the thought behind why we uh we do this and we were doing like the lack of thought that we were doing a New Year's show we wanted to say we're at\nNew Years you know in times square this is another one coming out of the different one now different time when we were in New York Times square and we were going down to a a reporter Johnny Jones on the spot on the spot reporter and he was interviewing one of the people waiting for the ball to\nHandle a female voice five and ready to female voices and a half a six hours is a reason I Want to say Hi\n\nSay Hi to tell you\nWhat is your brings Sally this is a problem I think it might have someone in trouble and already I don't know what I've been there and wait for the last twelve hours and we've become very good for\nYou to go so we're actually not in times square I'm sure that's pretty obvious\nWow I thought we were [laughter]\nAnd then later on just to me they show we we uh ... if you didn't redo this I don't know if everyone got the joke that the whole thing was a set up to one joke where\nAre our reporters down at Times Square\nAnd he's so involved and they can't go to the bathroom these freezing cold he doesn't know why is there is miserable and he just rants about that and the whole point of being down there is to get the I'll be honest and the feel of the ball dropping and the crowd screaming for the new year and this is what happens\nAnd I don't know why I'm not even down here\nJohnny, Johnny was just happy just missed the entire can't believe he misses he said we we get a reporter Johnny you still there I'm going home\n[laughter] I have a little short but\nSo what he I I forget he miss you guys just ranting and raving about how miserable I was down after the idea of all these people have I don't want all drive right behind\nThe [laughter] so if you missed that show that was on New Year's show of of last year two thousand eight team um and then we had a a these are like one time kind of characters if you will get Bruce banner visit\nWe did a show huh yes hammered the hulk yeah this just came out of out of nowhere mostly a a David Cohen's imagination of the\nTemperament of what a Bruce than it would be wrong sided thought that being a superhero will be exciting and and something that would bring a agreed ambiance to the show and this is what we got to tell us how that what's that like\nDude my life as miserable I never know when does alter ego for kick in so I Can't have a girlfriend I Can't have a family so what kind of relationship could you ever have with anyone ... when when the prospect of turning into this monster and killing them is always present\n[laughter] you know this is kind of brought this show to a screeching although and there's a reason these are one time heir that's again that's trying to hide the voice or anything uh just hoping you enjoyed it his one where we did a call in show a new on um April Fools and we were trying to see if we had this one recurring characters\nWere pitching were pitching show ideas are\nCallers would call in pitching show ideas right and we had this one character from ah Chicago that kept on calling in with ideas of shows that we already done rather than a million of them and then finally you know one by the I don't know oh this was has an ID talks about a UFO show\nOkay I Want to hear from that perspective but then they asked [laughter] yeah for that perspective I sent this why he thinks of your follows the dentist eBay live in the studio not calling in what do you think it can you pull that off we\nCan we've had a dentist Dr John ... on I think five times he's been on many times since then it's probably been on it I Would say ten times the league and the ... he was just funny to hear us or you\nMock a hour or would\nYou say ... resident you if you follow junior follow just everything all this new again an actual dancers yes [laughter]\nAnd so that that you could laugh about cells it's always good to have a good doctor a wrong with that and by the way we do have lots of a UFO shows or to listen to we we do them\nAll the factual everything that we present is a you know presented as facts and we've got clips and tapes and things out but we do with a little smile to try to pass the time has some fun with it but I'm along those lines we had a show we did Tarzan\nAnd this is not really a coward to put just taking chances what we're doing with the rate of just trying to widen the horizon to make things fun a David tried to imitate that we both did actually they Tarzan yell show ... All right that\nThat's a good one I did that happen I think we just had the argument you love to have in in a time than talking\nTo you go [laughter] that's one of our a pitch lines is that we like to have the argument you love to have you on everything all this new again and so again just trying to take some changes one instead of just sort of straight show when you hear the radio now it's so a pretty straightforward\nAnd it's easy to talk about sports or talking about medicine or we're talking about politics or what else is there already are hearing music\nYeah they're all like they're scripted with a point of view and very succinct and and to the point our show the exact\n[laughter] we're we're a civil to a ... degree of one percentage of of curb your enthusiasm in that but when he has to end that they they just set up here's a general idea what the scene is go and they ... they do it for his Asian and most of the\nTheir you know I'm sure they throw a lot out we we don't feel anything out uh\nI like to do comparing us a curb your enthusiasm that's all right it's a very bold\nThan one percent and I think it's an ... that we should have even less than about senses but ah who just say it's ... just to I could say\nSomething in the universe is that it's something\nLike it and if enough of you actually start spreading the word about our show maybe we will be the next curb on the radio that try a what we are the next curve but we're not recognized as would we need\nMore in our own moral yes in our own world we are the next and speaking of our own world we had this character just kept in this ... kept him ... yes a captain from the old old old old old days and that's\nA a pirate that we didn't think works way back when the first time we did it and he's come on twice since since I think it works out pretty well so let's just listen to have to\nMake me happy [noise]\nOkay what is that kept the balls than those that get yeah don't talk to me like I'm your friend what ha what happened to me and I'm coming to see by a black\nGuy that's what we got hijacked by Ken yes we're on a yacht race and captain balls at a hijacked us um and yeah well it was a very interesting story line development David reveals something weird turns revealed\nNot to be a real the captain way I like about the captain balls that impression is that it's not a sticky thing that's been done a million times [laughter]\nAnd I know there's your your wife has it said on the air when she's visited us but she hates captain bull's eye and she explained why\nWell I think the blue mentally there's a message I should be thinking about it in a while I think for the reason I just said sticky and she did say when she first heard it's cute right that that doesn't fly we\nWith all the other ones were presented in the movie itself the wizard of Oz he was not even mentioned in the wizard of Oz he was in some other movies that mentions him but he's a character became I said let's do something different with wizard of Oz everyone has talked about the wizard of Oz I ... and all this so we actually visited there\nSo we went you went back to the books and found this character they never made it into the you know the famous movie for an hour outside right what what would he be saying if we gave him some air time\nWould be upsetting that'd be very upset at the ... best of ah [laughter] you know he's like well I'm left here and he's looking for work it's Seventy eight years and he said no words [laughter]\nAnd so now he's become a a mainstay in some ways uh to the show and here he is breaking in a two hour show on Halloween 'cause he was chased by kids at Halloween member he's a\nBean with a pumpkin head yeah right\nPumpkin head yes ... why are you\nStressed out I it's unbelievable but I'm the president jak aware and from that's on everybody's front porch ... or so there are kids chasing you and tries to me because I'm a I'm Alive pumpkin I my miracle yeah my wife pumpkin and the company had walking around they want to look my pumpkin ahead\nAnd put it on unless they're depressed than ... on their front porch [laughter]\nWas an easy to say that tongue in cheek if you know but there he was so\nI Would take a moment here which of these all these characters are come alive to you or do they all I mean any of them fail any of them really work where do you stand on that me yeah um any of the model is\nNow I I you know what I ...

Mars\nYou know the national geographic had a very spectacular season one a program about Mars\nInto leaving fiction with fact\nAnd in the second season airing very soon that National Geographic channel we have season to again continue being a discussion of what it's like to actually live on Mars and Lucy and myself and many other scientists are featured on this National Geographic program season too\nAnd also people begin let me just say that if you want to find out more about my work go to my website I'm Cox dot org and K. A. K.

times best seller is that I read in the latest one is called the future of humanity talking about are possible future in outer space\nWhat are the what would it be like to go back to the moon to Mars to go to titan and perhaps even to this SARS but with us today to talk about doing to the stars and specifically going to Mars\nOh you do the stars and specifically going to Mars is Dr Lucien walk away as she got her bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in ...\nShe has a master's and PHD from the University of Washington She's taught at Berkeley and Princeton and now she's an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago\nSo the next time you may be in Chicago one or two job by the Adler Planetarium is one of the great tourist attractions and the great city of Chicago so Lucy and glad you could be on science then testing\nOh thank you so much for having me it's a real pleasure [noise]\nOkay well the first question you is think back now as when you were a child when you were a use which do you do in the direction of science and then astronomy\n[noise] you know I\nIn terms of what scared me towards astronomy I actually got my start\nDown the hall from you in the city College of New York um but long before that I was always just a really curious kid um you know I remember distinctly like hiding a loaf of bread under the couch when I was little just to like see what would happen [laughter]\nSo I was always doing things to try and look at the natural world around me um but when I was at the end of high school the New York Academy of sciences had a summer research program for high school students\nAnd so I actually worked with your colleague Miriam Sarah check in was solved state physics lab so in other words studying all the little silicon semiconductors that make up by all the cell phones and it's a wonderful technology that we have today so\nAround the moon but going back to the moon and then after that to Mars and then the on to the asteroids maybe tightened who knows maybe to the stars\nBut which is today is Dr ... who's going to walk us through the steps of what it would be like to be on Mars and then one day our descendants may one day visit the stars\nShe's in a stronger as the Adler Planetarium she got her bachelor's from Johns Hopkins university and since extend a PHD from the University of Washington She's also studied at Berkeley and at Princeton and now she will be on the national geographic doc huge drama\nWell the Seattle when we last left off and we're talking about going to Mars and let's see now we are on the red planet what is it like what's the weather like on Mars what would it be like to to roam across the surface of the red planet\nWell I think it's a funny thing about living on Mars that the weather is whatever you make it so\nMars of course has its own whether it's known of course for these very high wins and these huge global dust storms that covered the planet I'm most notably earlier this year a blotting out the opportunity rover\nI'm from view so we have a fair amount of data from our spacecraft on what the weather is like on Mars but for human beings you know Mars is not a very hospitable environment for us so if we weren't going to live there or walk around on the surface\nWe'd have to live in some kind of habitat and that might mean you know building dome is on the surface that might mean actually building habitats under the surface into existing law but to this and we would be able to tune in the environment I to be really whatever we want it so\nYou know that means that you'd have your perfect climate controlled environment ideally anyway but if you wanted to go for a walk you would definitely have to have the protection of a spacesuit so again probably better than being exposed to the elements on Mars but\nYou know I think I'm as earthlings we get used to certain things like having the experience of a breeze or that feeling of sunshine our space\nSo while it would be a fantastic experience from the standpoint of being obese people walking around on an alien world um you know and then when you were home you'd have whatever your perfect climate control is\nIt also miss out on that experience of just being out in the wilderness I'm to be definitely a pretty different I think for human beings who are so used to experiencing their environment and these subtle ways\nOkay well ... billion as ambitious plans to eventually put up to a million ... million calling this on the red\nPlanet starting by gradually melting the polar ice cap so once again Mars would've have water liquid water freely flowing to the ancient riverbed dried up about three billion years ago [noise]\nSo uh well what are your thoughts do you think it's possible that one day we might be able to tamper with the atmosphere of Mars given the fact that it is so cold there but given the fact that to live on Mars we may eventually have to terra forming Mars black winter for the earth right now but what are your thoughts\n[noise] well I think it's really challenging so I Am very motivated by finding out whether life existed on any of the other bodies in the solar system and Mars for many reasons he now first and foremost that it's just really\nClose by an astronomical terms and its\nAnd the scene out first and foremost said it's just really\nClose by an astronomical terms and it's fairly easy to land on it doesn't have this very thick hot choking atmosphere the way that Venus does\nIt presents a really amazing environmental figure out whether life originated on another planet besides earth or whether that life is similar and and if it didn't ever get started there then why not\nYou know Mars has a lot to teach us and the thing about terra forming is that it really transforms the entire environment and\nThat means that you lose the opportunity to answer some of those questions I also think it's really challenging from um just a technical standpoint so let's say you could melt all of those polar ice caps and get all of that carbon dioxide into the air where you can make the atmosphere thicker\nWell you might be able to have liquid water on the surface you\nKnow the the ability to have like a lake or an ocean comes down to both temperature and also pressure\nSo you know you wouldn't be able to have liquid water on the surface but the thing is that your atmosphere would still be super dry so even though the water didn't boil off immediately like it would you know if you were to go to Mars right now and for a couple of water the water boil off and it would be gone I'm immediately\nBut even if you had a warmer atmosphere and more pressure the water would still evaporate into the atmosphere and so you would lose it pretty quickly so I think that you know one of the things that both the earth and Mars teaches us is that plan it's a really complicated\nAnd you know we don't really have a great way of controlling the the changes that were making to the earth that environment that are making it less have not hospitable for us as he pointed out\nSo you know I think um\nIf people want to transform the Martian environment we should think really carefully about the things that we might give up about learning about life in the universe\nAnd speaking about life in the universe is first of all how we found any evidence at all even the slightest microscopic evidence of life on Mars\nAnd then recently there was announced that there is a laser an underground lake of liquid water underneath some of the polar ice caps that's funny news liquid water under the surface of Mars but well what are your thoughts about these recent discoveries\nUm the lake is so exciting I'm so to answer your first question unfortunately we don't have any evidence yet that there has been life on Mars um you know I think sometimes people think that it's like a conspiracy or something like that but let me tell you you know myself and my colleague with\nTheir life on Mars could we would be shouting at from the rooftops it would be one of the most transformative an amazing discoveries [laughter]\nI'm for us to ever make or whether it was past life or whether it could even be life on the surface today so all we can say right now is that we don't see life on the surface but it doesn't mean that there is on life there somewhere um we have to well literally do a little more digging\nI'm now as far as that underground lake I think that is such a cool discovery in part because it is made with very similar technology that we used a steady um lakes that are under the ice in the Arctic here on earth [laughter] so\nUm there are a bunch of different projects done by people who are interested in going to places like Europa this icy moon of Jupiter that look for deposits of water underground um\nAnd under ice layers and so the fact that one of these underground reservoirs they exist on Mars\nYou know we don't know whether it's salty we're not really super sure how much water there is there but the fact that it there at all is really exciting especially because\nWhen we look at places um like those underground lakes that are in on the high altitudes here on earth we often find that there's life whether it's microbial or whether there is um you know more macroscopic life like fish and stuff like that\nYou know we find it in all of these unexpected places so maybe it could be there on Mars as well\n[noise] okay well of course I also have to ask you this question though it may be rather embarrassing for in a stronger years ago there was some commotion about a face on Mars\nAnd you can look at one of the pictures taken from our Mars orbiter it really does look like\nTheir face Iraq with the features of a human face on Mars and even a Hollywood movie that ends as astronaut survey this and see this as a sport but you're in a strong number when you saw what happened when we took close up pictures of this so called face on Mars\n[noise] well you know the thing about the face on Mars is that there's more than one picture of that rock formation right\nUm and know whether you see a faith or not really depends on the lighting\nUm so you know sadly I I don't think that it's us passport or a face on Mars but you know one of the cool things about it is that you know it's kind of like why um when you look at like a fire hydrant or like a hook on the back of a door or something\nHuman beings evolved to see faces in all kinds of places um because it's served this fundamental function of helping us identify\nWhether there's another person around whether there might be a predator danger I really think that it's a wonderful example of the way that um our brains are very much still you know like the brains of CAVE People\nWe just you know use these same like CAVE People brands now to look at images of space\nUm so it's kind of a a wonderful confluence of the ways that the human mind has evolved to work and also the way that we've built technology that allows us to look at pictures of other planets [laughter]\n[noise] well some people say that when we look at the potential colonization of Mars the key buzz word he is\nStill suspicions and I'll ask you about that after the commercial break once again you are listening to science fantastic give us a call the hotline

Dr ... the Adler Planetarium in Chicago so the next time you are in Chicago why don't you dropped by the Adler is a great show\nAnd Dr ... got her bachelor's in physics from Johns Hopkins university a masters in a PHD from the University of Washington and she's also say that Berkeley where I got my PHD so many years ago and also at Princeton University where also I was opposed to our many years ago\nWhere Lucy and you're also an expert not just on Mars but also on other planets circling other star systems and we've had this revolution and extra solar planets so first of all tell us\nHow many extra solar planets have we are confirmed orbiting other stars in the heavens\nAnd how many of them appear to resemble the earth\n[noise] well uh we are now up to I think around three thousand confirmed extra solar planets 'til um most of those planets have come from a mission I worked on for many years that I I joined actually just about a decade ago right out of grad school just prior to launch and that's NASA's Kepler Mission\nAnd Kepler that fire has confirmed around twenty three hundred planets with several thousand more candidates that are still being examined like detectives to figure out whether they're in fact planets or whether they might be caused by something else [laughter]\nAnd you know those we know that there are a handful of them that are in what are called the habitable zone around their star so that's where they get enough light that they could possibly be warm enough\nTo have liquid water on the surface but you know not so much that they're too hot and not so much the kid cold so I sometimes also called the Goldilocks zone\nNow the thing with Kepler is that it tells us how big those plants are in terms of size that we know that there is around thirty or so um that are around the size of the earth or so but it doesn't tell us whether they actually do have liquid water or whether the atmosphere is\nStill you know I think that this linked back to like Mars and Venus and earth than our solar system for example because if you were an alien looking at our solar system and you saw these terrestrial planets\nYou would not necessarily know with a telescope like Kepler whether the earth was habitable one right like peanuts might look just as good but we know now because we live right next door that finances hundreds and hundreds of degrees\nOn the surface not a very hospitable place at all and certainly no liquid water\nWhereas Mars is the other side it's got a very thin atmosphere and it's very cold but to Kepler all of this planet look like they're potentially habitable to the next exciting step is to be able to figure out whether those planets have atmospheres um because those atmospheres give us\nWarmth and pressure that can make it possible for liquid water to exist on the surface\nAnd then what those atmospheres are made up or are they all carbon dioxide like Mars or do they have that nice mix those elements and molecules that allow us to brief um like we do here on earth\nNow as I understand because of Kepler and the work of other son or as we can take a census of the Milky Way galaxy that on average\nTheir son or as we can take a census\nOf the Milky Way galaxy that on average on average every single star in the galaxy has a plan is going around it\nAnd there could be billions and billions of Earth like earth sized planets orbiting the stars I mean don't you find that astounding realizing that in the night sky there perhaps thousands of planets is what's in your field division that could be like and\nThat's the worst thing you begin to wonder or are they looking back at us [laughter]\nAbsolutely you know I'm One of the things that is so amazing about ... you know all those numbers that I just gave you a ... you know several thousand planets et cetera\nUm those all come from a patch the sky it senses that was done in a patch of the sky that's about the size of your palm held up at arm's late the next time you're out at night do out and put your hand up and just cover a little tiny patch with this guy and think about just the thousands of planet that we were able to find that\nUm what taking that census gets that is\nThe only thing that we got another short commercial break but after the break we're going to continue a discussion of what's out there in the universe once again to you are listening to science fantastic with professor Michio Kaku give us a call the hotline number is six one to\nFive six for date one three five and when you hear the recording makes that question make that comment and perhaps the you saw somebody heard on almost a hundred and radio stations across the United states so give us a call [noise]\n\nMhm\nWell thanks for coming to ...

thoughts on the hurt on almost a hundred and radio stations that carries science fantastic so give us a call\nAnd once again in this hour we're going to throw the lines open you're not going to get it but he said you know you get a recording and just see the earnings call in to the radio station and the city you're calling from and then asked that question that have always wanted to ask but never had the opportunity\nThat say having dinner with the kids then the kids ask you a homerun question that leaves you stumped what\nAre you gonna do looking like an idiot no you're going to get to the phone call six one to\nFive six for a one three five and hey why don't you put your kids on the telephone and why don't you have them ask that question\nAnd so once again everything is fair game some people say well I'm kind of embarrassed because I have somebody there and goofy ideas and people are going to laugh at me well hey chances are if you have a strange weird idea\nChanges are thousands of people have that same weird crazy idea and so why didn't you share it on the airwaves and sometimes these crazy ideas well not so crazy\nI like to tell you about the fact that years ago there was a sixteen year old boy who was didn't south is to the question and that is can you raise a light thing now come on give me a break right now\nIs can you out raised to like being now come on give me a break right now this is sixteen year old boy asked himself that question can you outrage liked being\nWell he ... he didn't know the answers so he went to college learn something called max equations and from then you found the solution to the problem well he was twenty six years old when he finally got the answer you published a paper perhaps one of the most important papers in human history\nHis name was Albert Einstein the theory was relativity the theory that gives us the atomic bomb the energy source of the stars the theory of the universe itself all because the sixteen year old boy as himself a stupid question\nAnd what is it expanding into well the skin the surface of the balloon represents the universe\nAnd therefore what is off the balloon where does off to the moon is the third dimension now if you're a bugs living on the surface of the balloon you can only see two dimensions lowered backward left and right\nBecause the balloon is the universe the moon is everything there is\nNow where is the universe or the bubbles are the balloon expanding into is expanding needed a third dimension now that the bugs cannot see the third dimension the bugs I can only see two dimensions but is expanding into the third dimension\nThe third dimension of space\nNow Einstein says our universe is a four dimensional bubble so what is it expanding into that system engine\nNow you can't see this as mentioned just like bugs in Nazi off the balloon but that's what the universe seems to be expanding into\nSyria which explains is called string theory string theory has not been verified now the expanding universe theory of course had been verified it every time we look at the galaxies in outer space\nShip theory has not been verified string theory actually predicts that the universe is expanding into a lesson dimensions\nNot just for not just five but a lesson dimensions and so think of a bubble bath of universes so our universe is a bubble and is floating among other novels out there\nNow this explains I think a resolution between two of the great pairing lines of religion\nIn the Christian religion we have genesis in Buddhism we have Nirvana now my parents were Buddhist and in Buddhism there is no beginning there is no and there's only states have consciousness called Urbana what I was raised as a Presbyterian as a child\nAnd every Sunday I went to Sunday school and I learned about genesis and the fact that the universe had a beginning and instant\nWin gods said let there be life so how can you reconcile these opposite point of view to totally opposite points of view one in which there is no beginning only states of consciousness no beginning no end\nAnd the other one being a definite point whether the universe began well the multi versus idea coming out of things here explains it\nBecause you see our universe our bubble had an origin it had a big bang there was a moment when the universe came into existence but there are other bubbles out there\nAnd what is it expanding into nerve Anna something beyond the bubble nerve Anna that is a letter dimensional hybrid space\nAnd so she says basically that all the particles are nothing but vibrations on a tiny tiny little vibrating strings\nThat physics is the laws of harmony the strength that chemistry is mentally you can play on these vibrating strings the universe is a symphony of strings and the mind of God\nThat Einstein wrote about in his letters and his memoirs the mind of God wouldn't be cars make music resonating\nTo eleven dimensional hackerspace so the next time you go to a planetarium and the children asked that question if the universe is getting bigger and bigger than what is it expanding into you can give them the thought that well perhaps is hyper space\nThe universe is expanding in another dimension\n[noise] okay well let's move right onto the next listener phone call\nI just kind of things here on a juicy and I were to ask a workout or your theory is actually my theory is that all the reason why ... was other animals don't have green or blue for um I was calling because we're larger creatures so that when\n... cars cars out or when the crash we'll try off a record tons of brown and therefore are animals and humans with a groove or ... or ...

Haitian or you know our choir away or ... or another harsh\nI'm moving to another ... saw larger and so therefore we're not big room because our Robbie I'm confused as to how far with the sky um for a ...\nA small town of course with the star wars we are not um so that's my theory on why are we feel like cars will not have or green hair or school hair or who are just like not what your thoughts on that are here are\nWell\nYour theory is not too far away from a evolutionary theory we simply says that animals change generation my generation with survival for the fitness\nSo I think you're using that methodology that there is the reason why certain animals have certain colors that because it makes their survival value higher\nThey can survive better to create children to perpetuate their genes to create the next generation\nSo that's the basic thrust of evolution which is also the basic thrust of your your thinking now of course the precise mechanism differs from the standard theory the status and it was simply say that bears or brown for example\nBecause most of the leaves in the forest or brown yes there are green leaves as well\nBut when you look at the habitat the actual habitat of many of these animals they do live in Savannah and as they do live in areas where there's lots of brown leaves and brown trees now of course there's bound to be exceptions to this\nLoser is for example and and reptiles can be green but the methodology that you are mentioning is roughly the same as evolutionary theory and that is is a reason now that's not the only theory another theory simply says that's the way it is that's the way the universe was created by God or whatever\nThat's how they were created and they'd been that way ever since\nBut if you look at the fossil record you begin to realize that well we used to have dinosaurs they don't exist anymore in fact if you count the fossils underneath your feet\nYou count them right underneath your feet right now to begin to realize that Ninety nine point nine percent of those animals are now like stink they don't walk the surface of the earth anymore and so going backwards\nIn time we see that continue will change\nAnd animals do change generation my generation and the mechanism for change is that you have a higher survival value which is of course where you're coming from that animals have a certain color for a reason and it's not because they were simply created that way or magic or whatever\nIt is because it increases their survival and so they can survive to propagate their genes now the precise mechanism difference of course from the Senate theory but uh I think you're\nYou're leading in that direction\nAnd that is there is a rhyme or reason to the reason why Mother Nature is the way it is and it's because the survival\nOf the fitness okay well let's move on to the next listener phone call\nList am a Palmer, Alaska and I had a question about a foot or it is really\nAbout black holes in it gets a black hole if someone is watching you will see\nThe person watching the the other person's values didn't wait for the black holes it will be an eternity stretching and they will be like the whole thing I was wondering how that works\n[noise] yeah you were talking about the fact that it should fall into a black hole God Forbid right so horrible experience but if you are two ways you would get that the sources of time now you got it backwards it turns out that you were falling into a black hole\nWould fall into a black hole in your time almost instantly so as you approach the black hole you see the thing coming at you really fast and then you're dead\nBut for someone from the outside way outside with a telescope looking at you from the outside you are almost frozen\nAlmost paralyzed and you fall into the black hole extremely slowly\nAnd in fact mathematically it takes an infinite amount of time till actually fall into the black hole\nSo that was even a science fiction story once where the bad guy falls into a black hole and he screams for a thousand years what will answer that question after the break about Einstein's theory of black holes if you want to get on science fantastic give us a call at six months to\nFive six for eight one two three five give us a call [noise]\nJoined a gym on line for the American kind of a semi attendance is one hundred percent was space is limited to secure your spot touching the joint to form ...\nMost of the first time ever John Lennon is being done on the field which cannabis stocks more time to deliver life change when will spend two weeks and months plus we will shows you how to become a cannabis angel investor\nBacking hotter startups before they potentially become worth billions of dollars to join American kind of a summit text wanting to for forcing ... attendance is free to join the four four zero five ...\n...

the check get um ideas of where you're going to go you know really honestly pick up the pieces\nBut it's tough to pick up it's tough to pick up the pieces as just a reminder of that especially in being\nYou know especially in and seeing that they're still finding people\n[laughter] so it's not completely there are still areas where they're clearing it out there streets that are closed there's places where they don't have electricity and that makes it very very um tough in credibly tough\nAnd then there's this I read this story the other day between three hundred and seven hundred barrels of oil a day have been spewing since two thousand and four out of sight in the Gulf of Mexico where\nAn oil production platform owned by the Taylor Energy company sank during hurricane Ivan\nBut for years there wasn't much conversation about it for ... year long oil leak off of leak off of the Louisiana coastline wow that's gotta be one of the worst in history I saw some photographs made me think of it because I have some some photographs I had no idea\nOf you know you think of Deepwater Horizon back in twenty ten but you see this\nAnd it's what's happening at the Gulf\nAnd the some of the biggest expansions of leases for oil and gas industry are in that\nArea and the entire outer continental shelf to offshore drilling it's such a a mixed bag I mean of course this does anyone want these oil leaks these oil spills no\nBut for teen years because they have broken wells that are releasing too much so much oil that researchers needed respirators to study the damage that when it took down that platform\nThat's what's happened so they can't even study it correctly\nUm\nThey are doing you know that they say they're doing what they can but it's a very very difficult\nTo to figure that out on average\nThey said three hundred and thirty thousand gallons of critters spill each year in Louisiana from offshore platforms and on shore oil tanks and of course the Gulf though is one of the most productive oil and gas regions in the world not just off the coast the United states about six hundred million barrels this year\nNot just off the coast the United states\nAbout six hundred million barrels this year twenty percent of the total think of this twenty percent of the total us oil production another forty barrels underground waiting to be recover\nSo for every one thousand wells and state and federal waters there is an average of they say twenty uncontrolled releases of oil or blow out every year wow and knowing that that they have to deal with that\nLike BP for example sets aside money they've got sixty six billion or find legal settlements clean up\nOf all of that and it's the same with some of these other companies what they have to um rely on I mean what they have to think about because of\nThese spills and then the ... it's a tricky thing\nAnd the clean up and it's obviously pretty tricky when most people don't even realize\nWhat's happening there and certainly I'd have to say I was one of them I mean I knew the birth still but I didn't realize there was one that was continuing continuing continuing to go I were in that direction\nThe president has signal from opposition to the nuclear waste site in Nevada uh despite the budget proposals to fund it to the president told a reporter he'd be inclined it'd be very inclined to be against during waste near Yucca Mountain the administration has designated a hundred and twenty million for the\nProject so it looks like knows is that going in a different direction or not\nUm in both of his budget plans to Congress they a designated the money for that and just to find that funny proposal energy secretary Rick Perry so we have a legal responsibility we have this waste out there we need to have this licensing issue addressed because there's a licensing deal that's being the\nDust and and as a vital that they have that happen um\nYou forget about the whole Yucca Mountain thing until you talk to somebody who knows more about it or they're kind of in that I guess there in that somewhere near that area I suppose are we talking about numbers\nPer cent of the numbers for the box office have been pretty interesting you know we do our cheap movie review and uh the box office who were stars born\nHas been pretty good and Matt movies only been out a few weeks and that of course this Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper but venom is really ruling us especially internationally you've got\nVenom crossing over you of star is born I'm crossing over into the numbers that they've caught they would see so then I had the number one spot abroad thirty million from sixty five markets\nA total Heathrow in North America that four hundred and sixty point two million a star is born and same thing they're cracking all kinds of markets it generated twenty\nTwo million Seventy five overseas markets the tally is Seventy four and totally globally is two hundred and one million but look at the comparison prevent him four hundred and sixty point two million for stars born\nTwo hundred and one million although I think those are the total climb up perhaps even a little bit more\nStay with us introducing

scary movie and then one that scare me the most I kinda like Ben movies but um\nBut since movies are different than flat a scary movie slasher movies I think are\nUm not not scary it's there because there's no sense it's the suspense that gets you so when I was a kid I was way too young probably to see this movie when I did but the movie Halloween I saw that movie and Michael Meyers that was scary to me\nSo now they have the remake forty years after the first original Halloween I guess forty years that's crazy so it it to open in first place Seventy seven millions in ticket sales\nThere's something about Halloween and Jamie Lee Curtis is back in this\nYou know all these years later and I wonder if they she was a teenager I think when that first one came out so I guess in the ... of it I don't know just the whole idea Halloween the movie and Michael Meyers and that's um\nThat's to me the scariest movie 'cause I was so young [laughter]\nSo little Saul Halloween that scared me and I would say um that to me it was a scary scary movies suspenseful movies are the ones that will get me all the time\nAll the time because it's just awful [laughter] you know what was going to happen

including his chart of the day\nAnd Dave is here to tell us a little bit about what's moving stocks right now and they've ... where do you want to begin you want to do Bristol Myers or if you've got a general seem to want to mention you know I think\nI'm going to pick up were Greg chair just left off and talk about Netflix a little bit if only because I mean this is a stock last week\nThat got people's attention because earnings came out and they were pretty well received in the shares moved tired though they didn't know that they're highs of the day\nBut you look at now the third day in a row Netflix's down at slower by eleven percent in that period and sure you've got a ... an explanation today you know the idea that they're selling two billion dollars of high yield debts of ... in their business\nHold on a second that why is that a reason today my wife had a reason for it shares to go to lower\nWell need because let's face it this is a company that's all about growth at this point they're pouring billions of dollars into programming\nThey're expanding internationally and it's it's a gross story and then you know the idea of their settling themselves with more dead I mean that becomes an issue when you look at this company\nYou know it's interesting to me and this sort of is making a bigger point here beyond just Netflix and it's interesting to me that stock markets seem more concerned about leverage right now than bond markets because there is not a meaningful move right now in other Netflix bonds\nSo to me it's ... it's really an interesting that you're seeing reticence on the part of stock traders to accept greater amounts of debt whereas in the bond market it's still wide open which is the reason why Netflix is doing this\nRight course Netflix ... you look at their finances I'm just going through their financial statements this is a company that you know the debts really taken off in the last couple years now you can argue they have the cash flow because\nThey are building their international business and that's really a so the engine for the growth at this point you know it's just interesting to see that this stock is taking another hit in the wake of those results that were new relatively well we'll see\nWe'll just we'll just say before moving on Netflix is a fascinating story because it is burning through so much money each quarter in order to pay for it all the content that it wants is actually distinguished itself\nI by doing and it's showing that it is able to get subscribers and it is able to even turn a profit the United states will be it not outside of the United states so very interesting story but it's also a cash burning basically I you know a company that tech companies sort of\nContent company entertainment company with one ... all the other big guys are trying to get into it and it's raised more than ten million dollars in debt over the past few years in order to keep going with this model and there is a lot of\nQuestions about why there isn't more concerning the debt markets why they got markets are so open to a company like Netflix and whether they could really start to regret it but they had in so far so I don't know it's a fascinating story and really indicative of our time I think\nYou know like I say it just it it kinda catches your attention on the day when you look at the broader market it's lower and certainly you know you think about where the growth has been it's\nYou know the banks' stocks that people at least in some cases point to and you know sure enough there are the ones that are kind of flagging a bit here\nWill leave the u._s. stock market is not taking a cue from what happened in China overnight right the Chinese stock market the Shanghai composite up by more than four percent that's the biggest increase from march of twenty sixteen you've got to go back two years there and it no follow through when it comes to us scores you could argue that\nChina has always kind of been its own market as far as that goes I mean sure it's it's taken steps to open up to international investors over the years\nBut at the same time I mean you know the Chinese economy a Chinese stocks is that they have kind of gun their own way to some extent so it's not like you wouldn't necessarily see that cause and effect either in the u._s. or elsewhere renewed China moves to its own drummer and has\nFor as long as I've been paying attention to it anyway\nAll right so let's talk about earnings is going to be the busiest to earnings week of the third quarter reporting sees and what are you most looking for I Know that a lot of attention has been on the ... names are but is that really going to be what site in the telling this this week\nWell I mean it's it's earnings were generally when you consider you know Thursday is going to be the biggest day burning season for the U.S in the five hundred and something like Seventy companies reporting tomorrow is actually the biggest day for the Dow Jones industrial average\nOr you go through the numbers you see McDonalds United Technologies three am you know so you're talking about companies that are affected by oh so the broad a economic picture throwing caterpillar to that mix a and then if you want to focus on the U.S for rising that some are lined up so\nYou know it it kind of a slow day on the army's front today with only half a dozen companies scheduled to report and a couple of those or after the closing bell feel because the U.S in the five hundred\nA nonetheless you know this week as as things unfold you aren't going to see a focus on earnings and one that jumps out from today's Halliburton I mean they had some pretty positive results and expressed some optimism about where\nTheir businesses going next year yet the stocks down more than two percent so people take a second look at those numbers and not like what they're seeing so much\nThursday Afternoon I think that's the time to to look at our earnings as well put that on the counter Amazon dot com reports results after the clothes on Thursday\nOh yeah that's that's definitely going to be a set of numbers to watch it and let's say that this is a company that really has kind of exercise it as power in the marketplace to make money I mean which they hadn't done for a number of years and you also we should note to get goals Peron alphabet after the closing bell on Thursday\nGreg Jared by the way a are of course our market me than he notes that another reason why Netflix I could be heading lower is because of a news report claiming that Netflix executives are bracing their employees are critical Wall Street journal piece on it\nThis report claiming that Netflix executives are bracing their employees are critical Wall Street journal

and blogger at ... go on at the Bloomberg who always helps us bring market drivers to you each morning ... yes\nNow let's go to our Ninety nine one studios in Washington DC where they can have your has worldly national headlines in ... President Trump says the U.S will begin cutting off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador as a caravan of\nNew energy no he's not he's in charge of everything having to do with the White House he's our White House editor Josh glue I gave you a new job as well stick with the White House okay you stick to the White House the energy coming out of the White House says all for a tax cuts\nBut the Republicans don't know anything about this can you explain it [noise]\nWell I think the simplest explanation is that a midterms are around the corner and you know if you look at polls are you will see that\nMost people are thinking that the tax overhaul that was completed last year has mainly gone to benefit corporations and higher income earners\nA than say the middle class um I think the Republicans and certainly the Trump Administration was banking on a bigger a bump from that tax overhaul thinking that it would really\nEnergized I'm not just\nThe broader Republican Party but also a Trump's base\nAnd those aren't necessarily can grow it yeah but what we're seeing is that they aren't so energized about that tax overhaul and you know there's a little bit of a recognition that perhaps it's not going to uh be such a boon for people who are say middle income or even lower income earners\nTill Josh the gist of the story over the weekend was that President Trump floated the idea of passing some additional tax cuts for middle class earners\nI before the midterm elections which seems improbable at best and a lot of people who are involved and actually crafting such legislation idea when he was talking about selling it seems like that conclusion is\nIt ain't gonna happen is that pretty much right\nThat certainly seems accurate to me I mean the look the disc Koch Republican lawmakers policymakers lobby us off guard and I think the um you know the only supporting a voice out there was even ... the treasury secretary\nSaid oh yeah that uh we're doing that\nI Want to go a little bit broader here what does that mean about what the key issues are heading into the mid term elections is that the economy is it the tax cut is it what President Trump has done I economically out with the stimulus or is it the social issues that we see what sort of a harder line on immigration once again\nWell I don't know what's going to be the deciding factor but he is really working all of those issues hard if you look at his campaign speeches you know and I don't know that you can speak about his base as much but monolith right now because they are\nThey are trying all these different things you've seen his rhetoric around immigration going much more harsh a back to the\nThe the sort of language that we heard in the twenties sixteen campaign uh this morning he tweeted that he wanted to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras El Salvador because of this caravan making its way north to the U.S border\nUm you know these are and he's calling the Democratic party party prime wants to open up the borders and went to a flood of criminals\nAre so you're seeing him going back to this kind of campaign rhetoric\nTo some of the issues that have helped him in the past ah with respect to the tax issues again I think that um you know you're right this has very little chance of passing Congress doesn't even in session the people working on it for well aren't even aware of it\nAnd when they come back it'll be a lame duck session until uh the you know possibly the Democrats take the house so this is a it it doesn't bode well and he's trying to play all of these issues are against the uh but you know up for his base\nBut uh again the the tax cut issue date weeks before the midterms with little chance of\nOf material ... seems a political\nJosh just told them I think the president is scheduled to go to Houston today he will be a stumping for Senator Ted Cruz or in the Senate election what other topics so he seems to pick subjects obviously specific to each state's race what's the most important thing in Texas\n[noise] I Would think immigration is playing quite\nIt's important thing in Texas\nI Would think immigration is playing quite heavily in Texas right now interestingly he'll be in Houston which is a very diverse city with a lot of immigrant a high immigrant population\nUm but you know just the state where Ted Cruz has seen some vulnerability a and Beto O'Rourke has his uh his challenger on the Democratic side\nHas you know he's taken a much more progressive line on immigration and talking about dreamers going back about a year last time we've been discussing that these are these are people who were actually\nBorn in the United states and grew up in the are brought to the United states has children right uh and basically grew up here uh you know who are were protected under an Obama era policy that he then rubbed\nRight so yet Josh we're going to have to leave it there are so much for being with us we really

to terminate they were going to pull out\nWhere labor to Bloomberg News national security editor joins us now for more on this story from our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studios in Washington Larry I'm old enough to remember this agreement what are the facts here\nWell you know this is one case where you can't blame it all on Trump or the Obama administration had also said\nThat Russia was developing and preparing to put in place these intermittent intermediate missiles\nThat were a violation of this treaty or they were continuing to go she ate and perhaps wouldn't have said let's scrap the treaty but uh again you can't lay this one all on Trump there is a U.S position that goes back a number of years uh that Russia was violating this treaty\nUh that uh the u._s. was at a disadvantage of these particular weapons a set up a hair trigger a that's especially dangerous in terms of a\nA an accidental or intentional nuclear a conflict uh so uh the question now is a will they be able to negotiate a sun new normal or to follow this and the other thing that's striking\nIs day in day out we talk about whether President Trump has been too easy on the Russians uh this is a rather hard line position a on a very important issue uh so it's striking to me that he's saying we can't trust the Russians on\nThis ... the Russians are already ratcheting up the rhetoric they say that there needs to be some balance and if the U.S starts developing new weapons systems it will have to do the same\nWell one of the questions I and I don't know all the time table size should isn't it and then\nComing ahead is the question that the expiration of the new start treaty ah on longer range a nuclear weapons and whether a ... a run out without a an agreement to extend it so\nUh the arms a race that we thought was behind us a is still unresolved and of course\nThe U.S plans to spend a trillion dollars are just modernizing not adding to the numbers which are where most of the ceilings are these agreements but just modernizing the nuclear arsenal so other nuclear up arms age nuclear arms race\nA isn't by just by any means\nBut and just to be clear here the U.S and its allies ... they have evidence that the Russians are violating this treaty that the Russians are building intermediate range than\nAn hour they yes there is definitely there is that there there are missiles and the question is what's the intention and a lot of these missiles could be nuclear armed or not\nAnd uh I think the Russians are the Russians have also allowed that may not be in their interest uh to uh to uh obey this treaty till the letter but also a they argue that they aren't violated the U.S and its allies that said there's clear evidence that uh this particular weapon is a violation\nOr anti again it could be a nuclear armed and that would be great danger\nNow at the president's national security adviser John Bolton is headed to Russia any indication in as to the message he's taking their\nWell I think this is clearly timed for that visit a it's very interesting that he's the messenger or because he certainly a hardliner and\nUh and that's showing up and more and more of the of the policies right now so he's bringing a message that\nThe U.S is is dropping out of this treaty or blaming the Russians and uh watch and I guess the question will be once you're counter offer a so it's a it's a significant visit it's a significant messenger and John Bolton\nTo send it to the end again to sit for Donald Trump to be sending to Russia and ...\nAnd this is just breaking down the Bloomberg Terminal a that turns out that John Bolton is going to actually be meeting\nBloomberg Terminal a that turns out that John Bolton is going to actually be meeting with Vladimir ... according to the Russian news service\nTest yeah that's the expectation and we should be hearing something from the after the meeting tomorrow from what I had to stay and so it will be

mistake\nYeah it's interesting as people have noted that Gorbachev side gets great respect in the wet his role and dismantle in\nUh the Soviet Union is no longer viable a hero in Russia where he's seen as someone who led the greatness of Russia road and that has only fed ... role but he clearly goes back far enough he was an architect and\nUh he uh he has been vocal in bemoaning ah the idea of

with the first election interference charges of the twenty Eighteen midterms but before we get to that let's go back to\nBob move for a check on world a national news Bob thank you days before the midterm elections President Trump is promising another middle income tax cut\nSo Brad the charges were brought by prosecutors in the eastern district of Virginia night not by mothers prosecutor it but she was an accounting for the company owned by one of the Russian oligarchs indicted by Mahler in February ... you can keep track of that\nTell us more about the charges and the seeming disconnect between which are handling them\nChurch so the charges are actually rather simple straightforward\nIt can be risky to defraud the United states that say federal provision in criminal law that allows US government to prosecute someone if they find a way to interfere in the government lawful administration of its duty in this case\nAre administering federal elections and the ability the American

having correct and accurate information when they go to the voting booth Fifteen days and decide who's going to represent them in Congress show that was who they brought the charges on it she the ... the one who have handled blacker itemize everything\nThat the entire team of Russian trolls was overseeing and the reason it wasn't done by Mueller's team this horrified and how this goes back to the OJ doing things properly\nIs because of the narrow scope of his mandate it doesn't necessarily fall acidic Lee within the question of whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign\nAnd the Russian Nashville so when he came across the information the ad it was filtered back up to the OJ leadership they said no we'll handle this one separately you keep doing what you're doing and the headed up the eastern district or junior to possibly\nThat's just the timing after all the talk we heard about the Justice Department refraining from taking actions around the midterms which could influence than you had this indictment coming less than three weeks before the Nick terms if they're at each year\nI Would I Would be either to read too much into it so the unwritten policy what's referred to it that they won't bring indictments ... interfere in the election\nBut certainly is probably why Bob Mueller has an\nOdd take any action against Roger Stone whichever was pretty much assuming it'll be indicted sometime after the election for his article criminal actions lead up to twenty sixteen\nThat's why he hasn't gone up after anyone else delete or any of the other individuals who may or may not have been willingly coordinating with these Russia ... what he did what he's a limited as to what the eastern district\nLimited it too was only the Russian national they did not bring anything against the U.S national anything that could possibly\nUh bring anything against the U.S national anything that could possibly influence the way people look at it it would have been somewhat tiger the Trump campaign Trump associates or even a political player they specifically limit the only choice for national with the idea in mind\nThat that would not play on people's use of president and the party over which he provides one way or the other [noise] so\nThe Justice Department the office of the director of national intelligence the FBI and the department of homeland security all joined together in a press release talking about foreign interference in us elections being a threat to democracy ... anything actually being done about the need terms and possible actions like this one\nI think that they're all kind of on higher alert than the word choice you know the Obama folks\nThey got caught you know why they were blindsided didn't quite get coming the way it did everybody knew that there is always you know times but horn players here so distant from Asia to interfere in the election but what they saw on twenty ... was on a level they never seen before did not and they were caught flat footed\nAnd so you know even putting the politics aside the president commentary about whether or not actually meddling or whether it was with collusion I like that

Marcus I'm Doug prisoner and that is your Bloomberg Business flash\nAnd thank you so much Mr Chris and we'll be back with you throughout the show\nFor headlines by the headlines I feel like I was just reading down a worldwide top when the Bloomberg care a lot of these stories were going to talk about uh not least of which is the Oculus founder\nIs the latest big time executive one of the acquired execs leaving Facebook of course that follows the Instagram a duo as well as the CEO of what's happening\nYeah it's kind of interesting right when anything tech companies they pick up on some of these relatively smaller players they take our founders with them and then they start meeting and everybody wonders what does that mean for the company that the kind of lose its culture identity because some of these guys have let\nSome of these entities kind of run as their own right I bet you do wonder when they become assimilated into a bigger broader\nUh owner if you will like what happened\nAnd then of course do you think about what happens next because these are in almost every single one of these cases these guys aren't retiring no money to but they are going to mean many of them are in their thirties or forties they're going to go a start something new so looking forward to getting into that either ... or this Blackstone story that you were teasing\nA before and I was as well massive scoop from Bloomberg you know coming out that late yesterday I into this morning it really is the talk of Wall Street this connection of Saudi Arabia and box to\nWhat Julian ... we're going to talk to her in just a moment that what's interesting is she just said she getting feedback on this story and I think it just reminds us\nThat things are complicated within the financial community especially when you're dealing with sovereign well funds and investments are nothing is straightforward but this really kinda peeled back the layers and ... it's a really\nGreat look inside how this works so this is going to be a Segway cats I was on my pillow time this morning you know I Love the ... and it must have been a premonition because one of the songs that the instructor pick\n... are back the boys are packed with us Dave Wilson sucks editor for Bloomberg and job wise in the markets editor for Bloomberg as well as the co host of what'd you miss\nBack with us in our studio to help us make sense of what's happening in the markets among other things so Joe was start with you welcome back yeah show you've been working\nYou just have to have in your vacation I always thought I was taking it up oh okay oh well there you go to and\nI went to a a a cattle auction in the west of Ireland on Saturday no there is or even on my vacation I was like you went to a large the commodities markets and what was your take away\nA cattle prices in the west of Ireland are down because a Turkish demand is off so there's a real story there are a true global market really ended up as soon as\nThey would have been a blast yeah and I blessed\nUh what do you think in the markets today at the end I guess back in well obviously viewer down again and so that's a but it's interesting to the Texas hanging in a little better cars going into this week\nI think a we've seen tech dramatically underperform I was really struck by the degree how fast the Netflix erased it gains right there was really strong earnings on Tuesday stock fell from ... to about twenty percent from its high uh after hours on Tuesday really giving it up through the rest of the week\nSo then you have a some big names this week Amazon Microsoft alphabet all this week Facebook's going to be early next week but it feels like the stakes are really high on those because investors are clearly skittish about Texas Tech has out performing today and that gives them but there is a lot of anxiety and something I've been thinking about is also um\nHow much money from us Saudi Arabia goes into private sector tech\nThan we were ... and other starting up to the world to everything tech feels a little jittery right right and not just that not just directly or indirectly through lead on but on yeah I absolutely All right Dave coming in here what are you saying\nWell I look at it this way there are four companies in the U.S and the five hundred the reported earnings today before the opening bell\nAnd all those shares are lower what does that tell you write your services company haliburton toymaker has row the consumer product maker Kimberly Clark all down about three percent at the moment\nThat you have the uh drug research company on cue the holdings lower by about seven cents a ... percent so\nIf nothing else it's sort of reminder that are\nAs earnings goes so goes stocks of eyes the to some degree here\nI mean you were go long ways to go clearly to get through third quarter earnings season in a whole lot of companies\nTo look at especially this week Thursday will actually be the busiest day\nOf third quarter earnings season for the U.S and the five hundred with about Seventy companies reporting so\nYeah so I Want to get through and they're just trying to make sense out of how the fourth quarter works and you know what's ahead for next year I mean as far as today's results go what jumps out is you have sort of a cautionary Tono from companies as far as what\nThis quarter is going to look like Kimberly Clark in particular talking about higher commodity prices are rising dollar how's it going to hurt they're operating earnings for this quarter more than they expected back in July\nAnd it it's going to be an issue going into next year so that sort of thing that's really kind of front and Center for investors is trying to size up the outlook for profit\nSee I Do think it's going to be that that is ... and whether or not they live up to the evaluations Goldman Sachs had an interesting story ... put it out\nAnd just says Goldman is defending tech stocks saying I'm basically if you if you are selling the tech did they kept names makes you doing it for the right reason and I thought it was interesting\nShe talked about the price to earnings multiple tech shares trading ratio that's seven percent above the S. and P. five hundred well below the average premium us thirty percent of the past three decades can we talk about the tech sector yeah being over value but when you start breaking down and maybe not so much\nNo I mean exactly right and the way that so many of these companies are phenomenally profitable and even in the slower mode growth still put other companies growth rates to shame so you can't think about it purely based on a you know these are wildly over Plato and peas or whatever\nThey look at their businesses right I'm like what kind of revenue growth numbers are yeah kind of profitable absolutely grad France were thing as well um I think he said why don't talk to have you back markets at her I ... I cannot imagine is coming up at four pm last time I'm Bloomberg\nI haven't talked to have you back markets that are at Bloomberg News catch ... coming up at four pm last time I'm Bloomberg TV Dave wealth and we'll be back as valor stock that happened again she's got a stock in charge of the day\nCan I read you one headline that I I just come across which is Richard Branson stepping down as the chairman a virgin hyper loop one\nThis is of course the company does plan to build a supersonic transport system within the United Arab Emirates this came up last week in the wake of all the Saudi a situation because Saudi Arabia is invest we're going to bring you more on that story coming up but first\nSect about moon for some world and national headlines in our living three ...\nA good day you President Trump is vowing to us we'll cut off or reduce foreign aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador assassins of migrants continue to march from Central America to war the U.S border\nCyber security tax cuts that are for the faith and they said to be in the hunt for big acquisition and that\nThey want to find out more on that and also about another executive connected to Oculus leaving Facebook so let's get into all of this hour fryer it technology reporter here at Bloomberg are joining us along with ... senior tech\nIndustry analyst that Bloomberg intelligence stuff that are Bloomberg interactive brokers today are right here in New York so let's start with his Oculus news what's going on here\nJust the latest in a series of founders to leave Facebook\nYears after their companies were acquired\nTackling Oculus says apart on what some of the choir would insert game was acquired duck had this this pitch where you could come join me and you can keep your company independent and kind of continued to run it without much meddling from Facebook\nWell fast forward a few years this year we had the founders of Instagram leave we had the co founders of what's up leave and now brands and read the former CEO of Oculus\nThe doors open and they seem to be running out what's is there something wrong at Facebook and there's something going on or or or agreements [laughter] you know our contracts expiring what's going on\nI think it's fair to say that the company is taking a little bit tighter control of these assets that they thought that they could kind of let be for a while I face looks future is going to be dependent on products the on Facebook itself\nThe user gross I sort of hitting a wall in terms of number of people connected to the Internet around the world it already has more than two billion people\nStill face a feature is going to be Instagram what's up Oculus is going to be these properties that they haven't really closely kept an eye on it and then for pregnant situation in particular he already was sort of moved out of the c._e._o. roll a couple of years ago\nUm in into a role does more to do with with hardware and a piece he connected devices like the Oculus raft\nSo obviously one of the other elements of that is that Facebook looks like it's going shopping not necessarily for both on acquisitions of the the type you just described Sarah but specifically in cyber security some Mindy come on in here\nIt seems sort of obvious why they would do this especially given all the reasons Facebook has been in the news but what does this look like in the in the near term in and what are some potential here shore so one of the\nThings that has happened with ... Internet companies like Facebook and Twitter they're generating massive amounts of data and so far they have not done anything in terms of you know protecting that data like on like companies like Google and Microsoft\nThat have you know invested in security for the last few years they are much better prepared in contrast to Facebook and Twitter and all the newer companies which house a lot of data but they really don't have those kind of security you know a software and on\nLike how could they not how can they not be\nGuess when you're learning rose mode and you're focusing on you know driving adoption I'll feel plot from security's always an afterthought you go back in time with any business security is always an afterthought you don't when you are a guy in the garage developing a new product but I don't think about security\nEverything that pays the bills they build all ... all of that because they had a problem right I mean this is a company and their early Montrose\nMove fast break things and they move fast they made some mistakes in terms of privacy in terms of user trust and that's not just the story of this here that is a story of face extensive very founding\nAnd this company you know they they realize when they have holes they need to fill and if they're not going to have the engineers is to do it internally they guy finally needs to look\nBut is this about a PR move or is this about whoa okay we've got this huge business we've got lots of information on everybody we screwed up on some things and now we have to fix it\nI think it's both I mean I think I think that the user trust that sort of image with the public about whether Facebook is taking charge of users security and taking it seriously and not just being reactive\nBut being proactive about what could possibly go wrong that half that exposed the information of thirty million people as a real wake up early because previously we were talking about developers mishandling data and you know maybe some human error this was something that was really at the heart of phase of engineering a ...\nMaybe some human error this was something that was really at the heart of phase of engineering a ... a fly in their software which is something where you really need to bring the experts and to discover how is it possible that this happened and you look\nAt all other clubs providers Internet providers Microsoft Google Amazon dip all made security acquisitions is just if you don't hear about them because they aren't huge but them all may talk insecurity acquisition so you need to supplement\nYour core product with additional security that you may not happen to have twenty seconds left shares their security farm out there that would be a good fit that people are starting to speculate security is a very fragmented market it's a multi dimensional market vulnerability assessment is one area where they may be looking and there\nAre plenty of companies to choose from identity management is another one and be of highlighted that in our report\nYeah there's a lot of this lady friends out there very much so and this may kick off a whole different sort of a raft of acquisitions and ... in this very ... good stuff Mindy saying senior tech industry analyst said vi surfer technology reporter both\nIn our Bloomberg interactive brokers studio you're listening to her

are more competitive right says that they didn't even expect to be competitive in the fact that it also going on to tell me that he thinks there are three specific reasons for that is growing enthusiasm\nThat being Kavanaugh his rallies in that caravan moving through Mexico towards the southern us border and in fact it seems that the president's going to make that more and more of a mid term issue with the president taking to Twitter early Monday to say\nEvery time you see in a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think I don't blame the Democrats for not giving up the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nAre a number of them in terms so unfair to to those who came in legally now while on friday I looked like that caravan might turn around over the weekend they continue to progress toward the southern border with Mexico being able to stop them\nTheir president telling me on friday that if Mexico can't stop the caravan he's going to send troops to the southern border to secure it take a listen and\nMexico is working with us and we wonder stuff is just is not going to not acceptable for us and them that doesn't work we're going to call out the military when it goes up the border it's\nClear that as the president heads to Texas to rally for ... that this issue of the caravan will be the largest focused addressed to those taxes supporters back to you\nAll right thank you enrolled President Trump declared the U.S will start blocking federal aid to Central American countries for failing to contain that my grand caravan on America's Rachel robot or has the latest developments on the migrant crisis\nThe number of Central American migrants fighting to make it to the U.S southern border rises and the new caravan emerges according to the Associated Press\nSecond caravan made up of about one thousand people invaded Guatemala from North on Sunday as a race to catch up with them more than seven thousand other migrants rushed and that's the border over the weekend the migrant caravan of which started out\nWith less than two hundred people have grown over the past week and it's

Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for failing to stop the Caribbean and it tracks and he's also threatened to deploy military troops to the southern border with Mexico is ultimately unsuccessful\nBut presidents warning contests Mexico has made repeated efforts to grant asylum to those who illegally profits quarters including offering to transport the migrants pushed shelter but many Murphy's over fears of deportation which were bought out one American is\nAll right with more on this was bringing lieutenant Steve Rogers is a former navy lieutenant commander former member of the FBI joint terrorism task force who now sits on the twenty twenty advisory board for President Trump's campaign lieutenant thanks for joining me\nMy pleasure thank you\nAll right I Want to start to what the developing situation we just saw their south of the border moving toward our border based on what you're hearing regarding Middle Eastern terrorists in a caravan how likely are we to see a full\nMilitary response for military involvement at the border ready to take action\nWorld to begin with this is indeed a very critical national security issue that at least in my lifetime we now have a president who is making a very good decisions and it's going to take decisive action\nTo make sure that uh no terrorist or anyone who is attempting to commit any illegal act in this country is not going to enter our nation so look there's always a possibility that a terrorists will cross the border\nWhen I worked at the FBI national joint terrorism task force after nine eleven our greatest concern was terrorists crossing the border\nAnd look they're not going to cross that border with firecrackers they're going to cross that border with deadly deadly weapons and our president knows very well that this could happen and uh he's going to take the action necessary to protect the U.S military to stop them believe me President Trump says what he means any means what he says\nWell from a from a policing standpoint what's what's possible in Mexico we hear what the president and he's all in on making sure that we've got the border protected what's possible in Mexico what what do you feel the president would like to see being done by Mexican law enforcement how do you stop seven thousand people\n\nWell the president has made it clear he wants them in fact that not only to law enforcement agencies were perhaps their military will have to get involved\nAnd stop them especially coming south of the Mexican border\nSo they're going to have to engage these people they have the ability to arrest them and to deport them\nBut they're going to have to take decisive action and look the president is using the dollars he's using the money or they could stop and you don't want a lot of these politicians in Mexico don't want to see that aid to stop so he's using every bit of leverage he could before they reach the U.S Mexican border\nWhere where do you see this going a little ... where do where do you see this headed\nAs a as obviously the midterms are coming up the Democrats are using a lot of this as a as a pope but so to speak where do where do you see this going on as we get closer to the mid term than going forward as far as to continue this is now the second large caravan to come through\nHum in recent months\nThis is gonna backfire terribly onto the Democrats look I've spoken to people no matter what political party that they belong\nTo they get it they understand that drugs is going to be crossing the border the opioids\nBelong to they get it they understand that drugs\nIs going to cross that border the opioids are killing our our our our youth in this nation they're coming from the that southern border we've got possible weapons being smuggled across that border we've got maybe even young children and human trafficking crossing the border\nThey know when I say they people from both parties know that President Trump has this right watch what
