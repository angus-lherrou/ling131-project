you can base and see here but not credible and that doesn't make me go\nKendall I'm actually with you I think that it was a left to a left leaning talking point that said credible say credible say credible and then we're going to force people to believe what you had to say although there were as you said there are a bunch of holes in the story just didn't make any sense\nI think students here makes sense I think saying that she I Believe that she believes something happened with the story about Brett Kavanaugh was not credible I I agree with you on that\nGreat and and then\nAnd that's what I Do not understand it\nAre they not taken is too or anybody can look at her she was there but any way in their right mind any state it was a radical\nKenneth I got you know I think you make up of a

wrong [laughter]\nThey do not want to lose that one point five million dollars a taxpayer money they get every day because they know the Democrat Party\nWill fall off the cliff at that point and that's what they're facing and that's why they're so desperate\nI think you're a hundred percent right it started virgin allowed ... it's a matter of politics keep your sanity and we'll going crazy you're absolutely right um this was it about cabinet oh this was it about women this wasn't about Dr phil just want a better view that\nThis was about trying to stop\nWould they fear will be a traditional look at the Constitution's by the beach which is actually what we want we just want them to stay on the ... those knowing Jewish\nNeed to look at the constitution and to show them occasional for them is this legal as prudish foundation they went to Beijing to either be destroyed or they want to be living breathing in movable\nUm this is I think a lot to do about abortion as well\nWhich there is no abortion case up to the Supreme Court right now so that's also specious this is really about politics this has never been about because I haven't heard of a word about Harvey Weinstein lately once they leave you I mean it's like ... just one way\nAnd then there's a whole Keith Ellison storage where yeah where\nI Am theater jak because you're so right and that's the one that you should have been brought up to the ocean was he was investigated by the DNC by the Democrats should well just over to see here\nThere's a woman who's gonna pushers from two thousand succeed with a black arbitrator eyeballs doesn't fall out afterwards she says she did to her and this guy might be the top cop in Minnesota should help you understand that\nYeah and there's a nine one one recording I mean there's tons of evidence and where are the screening pounding on doors wearing blood splattered shirt ridiculous people you know who are demanding\nThese survivor's the quote unquote ... where are they do this and this is totally suppose there have Pakistan when I was in the west wing to sneak\nThey were telling me that uh you know their internal polling looks extremely good for the midterms nobody wants to get over confident but there's no question that have nothing has helped us and so if you look at the tactics when the twenty sixteen election you have to almost laugh\nIf it weren't so pathetically sat they didn't learn\nThat identity politics doesn't work and then gone through this whole cabinet thing and they're not realizing that doesn't work and they're just going to turn their guns on the next person it you know of course it's Donald Trump all the time it was cabinet now I was a Jim Jordan last night blessed to be\nWith congressman Jim Jordan of our Freedom Caucus says you know one of the good guys end up he's going to be nuts because if he if he has a fighting chance for speaker we do keep majority\nUm when he he is elected speaker he's even thought to be a up for it\nThen they will go hog wild over him as a coach they've already started attacking and you know it'll get worse it'll be fever pitch and here's what I Want your audience to understand there that\nYou know the moment the president calls you up on stage because maybe you started a successful business or something like that that's what they go after you they have dots me they've probably dots to Joe Joe I'm getting horrible letters at my house\nOut addressed my home address where I'm not even registered to vote I actually have an anonymous registration for exactly that reason\nThey given out my home addresses can send me hateful things and the list goes on and I'm not an elected official it's so expensive to me it's the on the public person I Am here take abuse I guess\nLike you are but you know our elected officials that we put their how their day how dare they dots than and expose their family's safety for us there our voice in the electoral process and this is actually not just stifling free speech and not just an attempt to undermine our entire constitution especially our bill of rights but really an attempt\nI I'd have to say the anarchy\nAgree with you I think that it's exactly that and I think that it's politically terrorism and they need to stop doing it but they're not going to start doing it if it's effective basically there's it's affected which Dr gene allowed no other reasonable gets mad politics keep your sanity and then we'd gone crazy worst question and I really I I this is where I'm going to do with your expertise here\n... this would happen will this force people simply left\n... center right maybe we're going to sit in the rooms force them to go and vote against\nThe kabuki theater we just offering group because I'm Cory Booker and ... and dined Feinstein and and Coons him and this idiot lawyer ... even though they really over tell you there you didn't they will just make a psychiatric or psychological change in the minds of people who was going to vote in the mid term maybe they don't vote no\n[noise] oh well I think that's exactly right I I don't think there's any doubt about that in fact new polling came out today and I'm a ... forgive my being Ramis I Can't remember who the pollster was but it said exactly what it's spelled out exactly what you're saying that\nDemocrats even in the vast majority of Democrats did not approve of how the Democrats handles cabinet independence in record numbers I leave the number fifty eight percent of independence to approve of the way the Democrats handled cabin on of course\nRepublican numbers were off the charts and so this is what they're dealing with and look you've got this guy comes at\nThree in this new law clerks show are all women one of them is a black American do in the world to to to try to paint his guts they look ridiculous and they're losing votes and it's not working they better come up\nWith a campaign platform I Democrats on my started at every day who tell me the same thing moderate sensible normal Democrats who just happen to like the party of Kennedy\nAnd that and maybe Clinton yet but they don't like this and they've been totally alienated and they're desperate to save your own party\nAnd ask for me and I live\nTotally alienated and their ... their own party and ask for me\nAnd I live you probably feel is like ... even though there is a little bit ugly and seeing the Democrats actually there's a lesson\nI don't like the idea of total Democrat flight because the lower that party but like I think the Republican Party I Will help the economy is and I like a strong robust Democrat Party I don't want to hear that one of them because they are but we are good and we that's why I don't want to beat him because that this down in ...\nI'm totally for give it a give and take them to leave for a lively debate I'm totally for having competition but this wasn't even competitive is was this whole you know somebody showing up and trying to to to kill somebody's reputation and then you've got writers for late night shows saying well at least we ruined his life you know it's crazy to me\n[noise] yeah well I Hope they're happy with us out there are also running their own jobs and I don't know if they're wearing their own most all leftists propaganda media is completely ... for a quick ... losing audience every day while\nWhile networks like near the fact that this is Aaron square Democrat for every day that I Know you get both sides um you know we're renting enrolling an excellent and so they're gonna have to

to keep their funding but their problem is that middle America voter will not spouse that so they have a real\nReal dilemma and I don't know how they're going to make it our past and that turns and

elections Bob Costas teeny as more\nAnd seemed to come out of those of blue with President Trump indicating it was not sudden\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of

election you know something she could easily a postponed I think before or after the election but then I got to thinking about it and and I don't know I I don't know how accurate\nThe information is but I've heard this on a several major a conservative talk radio programs\nThat a Rod Rosenstein ah was going around trying to get Trump far removed from to the twenty Fifth Amendment\nBuddy can only get a couple of cabinet members to agree with him\nNow it it just seemed coincidental that Trump met with Rod Rosenstein what just two days ago or something like that and all of a sudden you know she's ... she's going to resign I I'm just I'm just throwing his outdoor I've I've ... nothing to back it up it's just a sort of like a you know a gas in the gut feeling\nThat well it is it's interesting but I I don't I don't really think that we're talking you're first of all she's not always you may sit in a cabinet meeting she is not a a a a a principal a a a official as such as defined by the the twenty Fifth Amendment\nA ... and the so no I think that we're probably not talking about about that but I'll defer to our guest a Benjamin Friedman\n[laughter] I think I'm with you on that to him I don't I don't see that as a viable I'm not even sure how that would work but uh they\nWere the ambitions I think for higher office are clear but I don't think there's any pathway for her right now on that uh\nIn in at least for the for the time being in one could imagine a if Trump got impeached or in a tent needed a running mate that she would be on the list but that's pretty far out scenario\nYeah absolutely by the one interesting aspect to this thanks for your call top but just looking at the second floor of the twenty Fifth Amendment whenever the vice president and the majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments which would not include the UN ambassador\nOr of such other body as Congress may by law provide transmitted said or the president can do his job so on and so forth technically speaking [laughter] Congress could say that whenever the vice president and they have a jar of the members of the Peoria, Illinois Rotary Club uh that that would

O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. word one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the Allen calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live out\nHere he was ... spending that much experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried ... travel and most of the major player whereas in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith with on and on the major three ways but then if you run into a situation where much of south and North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going now go go on the major freeways first and they wait for the Detroit then that's when you shouldn't you shouldn't start on the side roads because it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh I'm In a state and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what I had the kovac has to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those rows you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is\nLet's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are going to meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major rose gets that location just in case you have to take one of those roads but when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say\nBefore let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this the so we've got to go to through this direction to that location so this way family members who rely on\nThose even the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning that tax so the email that says why is that our sons on and the people on the other side\nGet that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call them ... and your thoughts your or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nMakes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you said\nEverything's so wonderful that we know where each\nOthers are like you said and activate your GPS for your family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in\nTimes of weather related problems such as Michael you know the storms get thrown down you know can take out technology\nAnd if the towers that an evil that you're sending a signal to went down ...\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instilling receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will receive it was a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happens here\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio a good old ubiquitous over the radio always there to serve you see in such moments we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boat had a show with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\n... is a this coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise the than being a good script per movie um why not just bomb or a hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific\nA couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive\n[laughter] a waste of a maybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb to the case you didn't know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other uh him practicalities of such an idea there's just too big and really\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states was to let's say or just you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with this storm and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for died during Desert Storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there was a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and it goes straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hits they've got to kind of be upset\nYeah and I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody was ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact\nThe action led to what followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea of cloud seeding a part of the eye of hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left during then headed inland\nAnd the the I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe the ever again that was tried so uh the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly of\nOf one of just simply changes course and and damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and uh I think it could be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more callers will be an athlete Kobe\nAnd his book is the emergency prepping simple disaster preparedness

early afternoon when landfall will be going to a really become a reality Fox\nMeteorologist Adams plots and this Justin from the national Hurricane Center Michael has in fact now just reached category

many hurricanes back to back\nIt taking it seriously the money and management of each county each district each region the state itself\nI mean we moved I think it was seven billion people during the hurricane the ones that hit a\nI was it or not I can't remember from so many names now but think about how many people were relocated not only in the state of Florida but to Alabama Georgia it was just amazing you know we location of the masses and\nFrom what I remember no one was killed during this whole process\nRight one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to

Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now it's you know over the three million dollar mark like I said\nAnd done now you know over the three million dollar mark like I said and it's still\nTwo years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect on US Senator Collins\nBut I look at what Michael doing and I see that\nRed spot intensifying I look at that one hundred and ten mile an hour winds and I think now I live there and I'm along that Florida Panhandle I Am gone colored me gone\n'cause a hundred and eleven miles an hour forget it so making landfall Wednesday afternoon or evening between Pensacola really in the far western panhandle it's looking like just south of Tallahassee the warning is does severe and so worrisome\nThat the Florida State they've cleared the decks Tuesday through friday boom school is closed the university's not open\nBecause it's right where that can come Alabama Florida swam the river on there is what we're really looking at even parts of the Mississippi Alabama border so it could produce some really\nTerrible debris storm surge maybe up to twelve feet in some parts of the Florida coast\nAnd its course and his wife they been declared a state of emergency to get out don't get caught off guard that wouldn't sit on the edge I that's what I did these people boarding it up they're smart I mean look you lose a couple of days you come back and that's the worst thing that can happen to you the\nThe ... you know if you're gone you're gone that you can't replace wife and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back and that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it dissipates but boy does not look like at a keep checking that map and it's not is that's not happening\nThis this looks to be very very serious very very serious and then sadly what they're talking about some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm it knock it they're not going to get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that was so crushing and the first place and parts of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility\nIn New York they're not talking about hurricanes are talking about the state of limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license dilemma wasn't supposed to be on the road they fail to state inspection and as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including two pedestrians in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown it's outside of Albany New York and his dad these it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and they they're investigating it but\nThe limos slammed into a park SUV\nSo the people inside just killed four sisters died he just ... the limit blew through stop signs slammed into the parked SUV everybody inside was killed and then the two bystanders\nAre died as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know these young families young married but in their twenties early thirties\nUm I Can't imagine what they're going to that is how can they shut down this company this this company had um [noise]\nYou know it's crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating nest is the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm a few tens as an undercover informant for the FBI wow and you know what the governors saying and he's right is they had no business having missed on the roadway it's failed inspection they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all the things you're supposed to have\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people's lives I mean wow there was a couple that just were married like four months ago ...\nIt's just an unexplainable thing and I like I said I Know that area I Know that area well up by um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nSo that's what the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from uh this past\nWeekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen is the former President George Bush and his daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding or it was just the family\nAnd they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding where it was just the families and I'm In Maine\nSo Barbara Bush walks down the aisle with her father GW and our wedding or what to Craig coins who is a screenwriter someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend\nAnd released a few pictures you know it was on a social media and whatnot cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that I'm looking at a happy as can be but um\nNo ... no big announcement snowed giant\nWedding none of that just the um private ... oh good for them\nGood for them that they pulled it off and it shows yeah time flies she's thirty six years old her husband I guess is thirty seven and she cofounded a public health non profit called global health corps\nSo her sister genna Bush of course they are like I said with her daughter's um\nThat that's just to me that was cool moment is a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how does that that whole sort of understand that things were not telling the media were not getting we're going to try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can just have some pictures come out\nAnd they managed to do it which is wow shocking\nBecause it's so hard to keep keep anything is secret anymore\nNo you can't you can't keep a secret um you can't you can't keep it to people can't keep secrets that just gets out there like poof\nSomeone somehow here's something and then before you know it it's um it's out in the cat is out of the bag and that's it ma'am I um\nYou know we're talking about these tariffs on China and we're gonna talk about that more\nDuring the week here on America Tonight but somebody said to nearly can well what are some of the people that are getting hit by this besides there's some auto parts and you know what not and I guess one of them is because think of the things that are made in China dollar trade you're going to dollar tree with this ten percent tariffs on this two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nThere's a place where they're getting hit because they're jacking up the prices\nWhat do you think for the dollar tree sorry because of the ... it's the five dollar tree now five dollar tree you're still getting a bargain trust me but he they've had to um pull things off shelves because of the higher costs\nThey've had to re Iraq\nA bunch of stuff that is about ten percent of their merchant dies which would be thousands of things household health food hardware electronics all that they cause they'd have\nTo push push it onto the computer or the consumers and if you have things that are between one and they cost ... one dollar and they cost three or less that doesn't fit with the the store so you can't\nCan't have them on the shelves and like I said five dollar tree is very Confucius say right now there's a tariff he's going to cost you more when you walk in these doors we're renaming this tour temporarily don't blame us [laughter]\nHow's that don't blame us [noise]\nI Do see the two really

confirmation you and I talked about this for months and we say is that right at the very beginning you couldn't imagine he wasn't going to be confirmed\nBut you saw the turmoil that resulted of uh protesting really I'll play both sides because now it's like sports teams the Democrats and the Republicans\nSides because now it's like sports team Democrats and Republicans why did the Republicans prevail I'm what did the Democrats do wrong\nWell for one the Republicans I think made a couple of moves Jay Jeff Flake senator from Arizona I Know ... everybody Republican so I was angry at him but he\nSays okay look let's have the FBI take a look into this I think after that when they came back and we haven't seen the report of course but I think we know nothing changed so\nAfter that it was more of a he said she said and nothing you know startling Newt came out where for example more drugs\nOr the one guy that I'm Dr Ford said was there you know he obviously didn't change his ideas of what happened so as a result I think that you know that helped the Lindsey Graham speech which he just you know\nIt was on fire I think it gave a sort of a psychological momentum frankly for the Republican side and then McConnell just said look we're going to press ahead\nInstead of yielding to any pressure so I think frankly you know the fact that they just kept moving and again that FBI report I think really helped what flake called for\nYeah and and now a for Kavanaugh he moved on and there's the swearing in ceremony on Monday the president I'm apologizing to Brett Kavanaugh and his family since the terrible pain and suffering they endured after his confirmation Supreme Court\nFor Kavanaugh he moves on right and just takes the high road and that would you advise him to do and not making comments about ...\nBouquet you raise a great question because in my opinion you and I talked about this\nUh one of the downsides was his demeanor of just attacking back yeah he is you know especially when he turned to the center to the one senator and said\nHave you ever had a blackout drunk yeah and that to me raised a whole different set of questions also he had friends of his who supported him but said he had a different version of that night a different version of how he he drank years ago et cetera so\nThere were some definite holes and everything I think for him\nLook out if you live in Pensacola look out if you're just south of Tallahassee it could be one of the worst hurricanes to strike that sort of big Ben and Florida Panhandle region is what they call it\nI mean I'm Sorry you were trying to with than a hundred and some mile an hour when you're not going to win that battle so they have a hurricane warning in effect\nFor that Alabama as some of you are listening to us there and in Florida for that Alabama Florida border up to the ah swam the river so so really take this to heart and also on that border to Mississippi Alabama border\nRight there right in that the the beast and it means storm surge heavy rainfall hurricane force when all the things that that entails and most of the people there no I mean listen you know not to fool around with us so there's thirty five counties that have been declared\nAn emergency state of emergency\nBecause that means the funding Florida State their clothes their clothes from Tuesday through friday this week that's healthier if they're taking it no way to take a chance to make sure all of the students and any of the faculty is nowhere near there because this is right where it could smash\nInto even Alabama governor Kay Ivey said the same thing state of emergency because power outages when damage debris and the debris is what also can be so deadly you know when we had to last hurricane that came through a tree falls down smashes\nInto a trailer house whatever or you've got power that's out people trying to come back in\nIt's a nightmare so I think when you look at the two I think people are heating this for the most part especially after they watched what has happened\n... earlier in this hurricane season even Florence with the floods 'cause it's always the flood thing afterwards that you're worried about but this Michael past boy oh boy I mean it really is coming up through the panhandle\nAnd it could intensify so that's the thing maybe it's the cat three book could do me a shift to oh for let's hope not because then you're talking\nA little jump up and the when miles per hour you know a hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty something\nYou got five hundred Florida National Guard members who are activated of course 'cause you got to plan the logistics of it all where are you responding words everyone being deployed basically when it happens and then five thousand more that are there\nBasically when it happens and then five thousand more that are there so I mean this is happening so fast so fast so that means you know that's why they're clearing the decks\nIn 'em at Florida State because they know that this thing is bearing down quickly and it'll strike that panhandle\nTuesday Wednesday really Wednesday is probably who you're talking about a storm surge of about twelve feet for some of the Florida coastline and twelve feet and some of those low lying areas I mean that that deadly is what that is\nSo hurricane season it is I'm telling you it is unpredictable at times predictable least that we have the ... watches and you can look at the different maps thank goodness much different from those of you listening you get it tornado versus hurricane which is worse I mean it's almost a ridiculous question him since I have been in both\nNot the worst of the worst with a tornado the aftermath of a tornado yes\nThe worst of the worst in the middle of a hurricane yes right in the middle of a hurricane I experience with that was like\nWhere you're basically trapped urine locked down\nSo I Love that the cars and I was a kid so I Love that the evacuations really happen and people he them where we didn't used to do that wasn't quite the same thing it doesn't mean that nobody clear it out but not the way they do it now it's much much different\nI Would have sex from this hurricane\nInto this New York limo crash I mean\nThe status ever and I it it is one of the deadliest road accident in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were saying the deadliest you know why twenty people were killed it was over the weekend\nAnd I was watching one of the college football games and I thought it was a mistake I thought\nOh no they must mean that people were injured and a couple of people were killed now we're saying to stretch limousine killed Eighteen people in the limo to people who were walking and it and that's twenty\nSo ah I mean that's terrible and what happened was that this limo went through a stop sign and boom I you know unfortunately just collided and killed the people that were\nIn the limousine and it was um I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked I mean just the worse or victims texted that dilemma was in terrible condition\nMinutes before the crash so you had hysteria surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board the terrible conditions limo and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happen or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limousine didn't have that this is what's a scare didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate\nThey held a state inspection last month how do you know that right you see this limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever are you asking about that or you digging into that now so they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery so two people were killed you had um\nThe people that were in this limousine you you had um husbands and wives you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was a tech the text message I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo is because there was a last minute replacement after a bus hired to shuttle the group broke down so that the first thing that happened I mean what\nAre you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific because you know in their twenties and thirties\nUm yeah really just really really\nOf the biggest losses of life and and this is what the first responders she's saying that they've seen a long time and and just in an instant like that it slammed into to give you the further details on the story it's a dilemma ran a stop sign slammed into a parked SUV and then the two people\nOf you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there boom they were hit so it's a\n... it's just awful and it does make you kind of think\nAnd I don't know why 'cause I got to say what are you doing if you order a limousine you're asking people hating limo company hey are they good uh-huh hey I'm One of the people say about the motor on time they get you know are they do they know if they have a federal certificate\n... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people\nIn his limousine you know maybe I got to ask a few more questions or find something else out about that\nCompany because those people were thinking that they're just thinking I got to be kidding me this first we had this breakdown them again in the limousine and this happens and then the worst thing possible\nI mean just absolutely possible\nHappen we've just scratched the surface here in this first hour of America Tonight other things are going to talk about include demand cave got baseball playoffs enough football to talk about remember this week of course when I have another nail the score but next what do you think we're going to the mail bag\nOn America Tonight [noise] one of the sea of radio\nABC News I'm Dave Pecker hurricane emergency monster storm Michael is bearing

... they won't leave the product of echo across the bridge so to speak combs ABC News mostly Beach Florida\nSome think is negative because of Kavanaugh Susan Collins to me would be the one\nSeat that hits right there in the middle did you see what you had to say on sixty minutes I did I saw it she said and Heidi Heitkamp it's interesting because I Can't brisk is risked her seat as she is definitely she's a\nDemocrat in a in a Republican area and she voted against Kavanaugh and Susan Collins who has a lot of voters\nWho are independents\nEspecially in Maine she voted for Kavanaugh\nAnd there are people that are they've already built up the coffers for\nMoney to run against her and what not and I saw both of them on sixty minutes and I you know look I give him credit 'cause\nHeres what they both said in different ways that they they voted the way they thought they should vote and they weren't ... they weren't ... they weren't weighing the politics of it all is what they is what they said and Susan Collins\nSaid that that that she talked to Kavanaugh and the thing that you liked about Kavanaugh she felt that he was about the letter of the law and she felt like he would go by that because she's pro choice and meeting that weighing the law and the precedence and all that kinda stuff um\nAnd she said there ... there was no evidence there she said there was not um there

dollars right now let's take a look at Brett\nKavanaugh or should I say justice Brett Kavanaugh because of course the judge has taken his seat on the U.S Supreme Court in fact\nChief justice John Roberts uh open the session or the ... the court session yesterday by a welcoming judge Kavanaugh saying it was a great player and bet he wishes you a quote a long and happy career in our common\nCalling and here to tell us more about judge Kavanaugh and the first day of the Supreme Court session\nIs none other than our Bloomberg Law legal editor Jordan Ruben Jordan what can you tell us about\nA judge Kavanaugh is justice Kavanaugh's first day on the bench\nOr I Would say what stood out in contrast to his intentions confirmation hearings Israeli how overall normal it was a justice Kavanaugh ask questions just like his colleagues did of the advocate\nA there wasn't any of the partisanship that mark the confirmation hearings and so I Would say all in all it was a pretty normal and relatively successful first outing ...\nNow the justice has to select some law clerks right\nThat's true yes has he already done so\nAh yeah they don't have that about those that they are all female law clerks that was an aspect of his background that justice Kavanaugh himself had touted during the confirmation process that he is carry through his tradition of hiring female clerk at the Supreme Court as well\nAnd it's a collegial atmosphere in the context of previous rolls because judge Kavanaugh is also going to be working I mentioned with six of his former\nLaw clerks write a paper on that but if they were on the circuit court of appeals\nUh there were some uh judges who also we're on the D.C court of appeals as well uh I just overall justice ... you're alluding to certainly does have\nA connection than does know uh all the justices already and it is historically and famously but collegial atmosphere at the court regardless of the profit that it took a given you get\nThere during the um back in the time of uh Noah Feldman scorpions and of course we moved from President Taft becoming chief justice Charles Evans Hughes who was secretary of state and then to brief Harlan Stone Fred Vinson and then on to what I'm going to call the modern era of Earl Warren\nThe focus was on the chief justice there's a lotta articles in the last forty eight hours of John Roberts front and center translate that for us what does it mean that everyone should focus on chief justice Roberts\nI think that's exactly the correct approach to take and that's because we just had Justice Kennedy\nRetiring he was the swing vote on the court\nNow a lot of people are making the argument and I think that this overall the correct argument that chief justice Roberts now occupies that eventually the middle seat or the media and the court and so it's going to be the chief justice Roberts really the direction of the way this court goes in the future and that's given not only have control over\nIf the court goes in the future and that's given not only have control over by being chief justice the way that he runs the court in general assigned the right and things of that nature\nWill back to health care and what's the conservatives have never forgive him what's his track record of what I'm going to call us an amateur stability of vote is he predictable or not\nJustice Robert yes I Would say that uh probably people would say he might he might not be certainly in previous cases a chief justice Roberts has sided with his Democratic appointed colleagues to uphold a bottom chair\nAre famously a vision of eight and certainly as you know he got a lot of flak from that from conservatives including a President Trump\nJordan just a sort of anecdotal question for you is there a gym at the Supreme Court and what is it basketball court\nRight so there is that there is a basketball court there it is famously called the highest court in the land and are famous stories from it including a Justice Thomas playing and getting injured on the court justice cabin uh uh from what I hear a has a decent basketball game itself I'm not sure whether he's\nGoing to continue to the play now but they need a rink famous story from the\nThe legal come over and show me how to put the puck and Ginsburg awesome out there\nWe'll see how this is what I mean why and Jordan this question because I think it's very interesting that they are all these traditions and relationships that exist that are not necessarily a completely George ... is you're going to get bad news that was really informative Bloomberg Law legal editor and so we'll have to have him on again the flag I'm On\nOf her party is so fired up over this judge Kavanaugh thing she said that she didn't really notice that a couple of weeks ago\nSo I mean anecdotally speaking you have Republicans that practically begging to get back on the campaign trail the heartland to celebrate that that you point out forty eight you're low water point it\nThen you have justice cabin for and a ... and then in terms of the ethical stranger president but they're not that regulation but not a bad day to be ...\nYears is absolutely unique person or ... or lieutenant colonel in the national guard ... she's got real tangible agricultural jobs is that\nThat's great but you guys the Kevin ... released keep talking about the suburban woman donor I mean does that play an eye on is that going to play in terms of any hope for the Republican salvage in the house\nWell it does it and and I think that's where it gets really tricky for Republicans is because\nIn particular the issue of justice cap it all the issue of the president's rhetoric and and the issue of who they can sense that the that the suburb Delaware County Pennsylvania where I grew up or\nYou know down in Florida or who they can set in one person that they can't because she's going to be finishing out her so the end of the year\nBut on it in contrast to that argument the ... the map for a midterm election in the house is very different than a map for the terminal I set it\nAnd that gets really interesting because should\nRepublicans stop it went back to how representative the record lock ... at the forecast for the next ... here but the issue of the teacher has become much more difficult tickets back then it and it's looking increasingly unlikely that down with her\nI mean it's absolutely fascinating twenty seven days away from the election\nYeah who's going to show up well Kevin that that was my next question is what do we know based on past evidence about who actually shows up to vote during those mid term elections\nWell the ... the off the off party and and so actually I was parking number of Lancaster county\nWhich is a very rural part of Pennsylvania Democrats traditionally all all ultra conservative district have may have turned out raised it to its academically which is fascinating\nAt the issue of the on the one hand healthcare but also on the issue of uh of Medicare cuts to senior programs that is really\nOne of the driving force behind some of the ... circuit of of the Democrats the Kennedy Catholic so to speak\nOf of of yesteryear and then I Would also keep my eye on taxes and stuff that the race and I you know I mean I'm a store when it comes to this stuff but the Congress amateurs Mart door\n[laughter] well you know I mean this is how I spend my watch over and over but the Congress beta or\nA you know he's a centrist Democrat protects that she was totally updated\nA Senator Ted Cruz is an election and done it\nBy really running as a moderate really running that trip but also really big issue of immigration taking it said that the ... ah and make an economic argument which I find really interesting because no Democrat has made it economic patch that I've noticed on the issue of immigration\nAnd that but that that wants to watch to an application for him or that health food\nBut he totally turned that to a must watch race\nBut he totally turned that to a must watch race\nKevin just to complete your dark a prison door could do that right yeah ... there there is actually a toss up in the house for the seat in Kansas this is the cancer second\nIs I mean go ahead\nYeah no I don't care what you eat\nAnd like and that is you have the issue of Medicaid Medicare and health care really starting to mobilize because traditionally if you look at who shows up to your other point about who's actually going to show up on you said though\nIn a a an easy for them or will show up about ... ... voters will show up at the you know the younger voters who are motivated but traditionally haven't shut up and that's why I think your\nJob and the only way we can move

local officials alternative rock\nDavid I'm unfortunately this was a goal because hurricane of the worst kind of gets all the\nAs you see on the last of the storm surge estimates are anywhere between nine and fourteen the um\nThe storm surge is going to be the worst where the makes landfall just to the east or south of where the makes landfall somewhere right now it's projected between Panama City have electrical and then it's going to push forward so not only is it going to bring fourteen feet of ocean water and coastal\nFlood innovation there'll be wave action on top of that which is the primary driver while we evacuated served\nAnd then a couple of ... that you've got over a hundred and forty five miles per hour winds um you know the uh structures built before two thousand one are not designed to to handle that type of wind typically\nAnd uh it's going unfortunately push through the state so for asking us citizens in southwest Georgia central Georgia to be vigilant and just make sure that they understand what's about to come to this area is going to see a cat one cat to\nStorm as it moves inland and what the vegetation there while we're anticipating is a lot of down trees are impacting the power grid and uh you know here again we're going to see a lot of them devastation along the coast structurally and then as it moves in you're going to see power outages throughout the state\nUh and then unfortunately you're going to see rain fall into South Carolina North Carolina uh the Cape fear was a projected to start with feeding from Hurricane Florence two days ago and this little\nBasically says for basic problem and add to it a little bit of sorts going to keep those waters from receiving a little bit as it exists the state or by friday so they're\nReporting that is one of the most powerful than ever to hit a country is that actually affect\nThem well you know and so more in this area this would be the most intense hurricane that's been struck this area uh since Eighteen fifty one if I remember correctly so this\nIs very intense but this one is going to be heavy rain or is it going to be the ones that are going to be the storm surge and wins a and then for ... Georgia they're going to see high and low and when so you may see sustained category one category two wins with higher gust\nA litter associated so we're expecting a lot of damage inland as well\nBut we have to wait for the Governor Scott and his staff and direct was small down in Florida they've been leaning forward as well and uh you know right now there's no ... shortfalls uh when it comes to pre positioned so we have\nTeams equipment personnel not only with an embedded with the state of Florida staff and some of the local\nCounty emergency managers but we have a equipment and teams stage and Maxwell to Atlanta Orlando ready to move in once we can once the elements subside and pushed through and then we can move in and attack or to say that\nThe private foreseen face different utilities\nFrom working fail are already ready to\nReady to how they got\nA lecture companies are from all over the country actually it'll all lined up as soon as it goes by going to be working for them to we've got food supplies to change we're working with all of the states and the riches sorted\nAnd it's certainly a week ago this was a slow storm in an area they never tell us a set of grew into a\nMonster but so the first initial indications from the national Hurricane Center started coming in around Saturday [noise]\nUm and uh they picked it up and started raising the flag day the system's going to go from a wave to depression and cause potentially a rapidly intensify um and unfortunately that's typical of the Gulf Coast and when they do this\nYou know citizens have less time to prepare or heed the warnings ah we we are concerned that many sisters chose not to have those warnings\nAre but we are prepared with search and rescue teams to try to go in and do what we can't really cautious when she asked\nThe\nDay when we were concerned that we were not we did not like a a level of evacuation activity that we were saying and uh you know Governor Scott of him he leaned forward used the wireless emergency alert capabilities uh that we have\nAnd set out text text messaging last night going forward and said hey get out of there and so we were trying to get people to really take the series this storm seriously a lot of people did heed the warning but then there are those who chose to stay behind\nAnd unfortunately a first responders may not be able to go in and rescue those down on one on at this point\nYou dinner and he can officially in contact\nAnd the other governors depending on what happens here but they are\nI Am by a friend the other\nGovernors depending on what happens here but they are all either contacted or part of the process a at a long talk with Rick Scott Governor Scott in Florida very well coordinated with all of the states and you know one of the things that you must be said is just not so easy for some people believe\nSome of the air is a very poor that easy for ... without\nThe necessary money to believe so what we've done is we've said buses was that a lot of different uh we're doing a lot of different things to try and remove people from the area but a lot of people are very for in certain of those areas and it's very tough for them the leaf that's one of the problems you're finding I guess in\nSome cases uh you know you know what what we asked to do on on blue sky days is ask people who may not\nHave the means are the mechanisms to get out of town to register with our local emergency management agency in Florida's been pretty robust and doing that so that we have some idea how to pre planned for that and then um\nYou know we we do what we can to be able to support the movement of people when it comes to Georgia a you know we're not evacuating pre storm surge in Georgia this is going to be a highway and so so we're asking people to get within a facility they can withstand the winds\nAnd try to shelter in place or seek out public shelters that may be open in southwest Georgia if you look at the size of a longer\nThat and the red area basically he was there and we're going to have pretty heavily now that's a flat sell a lot of shore I get a lot of\nLand first aid in Trump's or all the way down in Tampa Bay which they are very low lying in ... they gave me an idea that harassed it's ... it's clay largest\nAlmost the entire side of the Gulf War you look at it ... it's almost the entire social golf and they haven't seen that [noise] maybe they haven't seen that at all nobody\nAssumed that the U.S the the the ... which is pretty wide which unfortunately is not good news as it makes landfall so some people may say it's similar to an ... three tornado making landfall on in areas that are close to the show it's it's a\nHe's not the area and parents to him anyway that they would\nNot in this area ... did not really heavily impact of the Florida Panhandle most of the hit a term from Irma was in the south west portion of Florida and then moved up through and and created some issues in the Jackson malaria north north eastern portion but\nThis area it's been a long time since has been hit so ah the vegetation hasn't been stressed and\nAnd uh we're going to see you know a lot of uh a lot of damaging devastation unfortunately and we have to set the citizens expectations that the parents going to be out for a while and what FEMA's role in that as as the secretary was saying our partnership with the private sector is that\nYou know we work with the Florida power light the Gulf powers to the southern companies the Georgia powers to be able to help them you know facilitate their mutual aid to come in and they got power crew's coming in from multiple states across the country that are already pre staged and when we were hit\nWe work with them to do what's called first push to breathe and get the roadways open and and uh so that we can get them down the runways just start fixing the power but that's going to take some time\nAs a teenager and travel\nNow and now we're we're always going to Pennsylvania it looks like there are thousands of people already lined up\nAnd are probably will do that tonight and we're going to go down here as soon as we can we don't want to interfere with anybody really want to go as soon as possible or you have the right here by we have\nThousands of people going tonight and they've already many of their already a\nAre we going to be there and what time when we flew in and do that\nExpress oh\nWell I don't know what\nTo do because you have so many people already there and it's sort of unfair to them so it's a mixed or I'll be totally focused on this but we're going to make a determination over the next little while but you know people that were you didn't\nKnow because I have great people including two but I have great

Peter thank you just breaking the bestseller New York state police say the operator of a limo company in that crashed the kill twenty people in upstate New York over the weekend is in custody\nAnd the charges are pending\nHurricane Michael has essentially arrived along the Florida coast et cetera last word less than fifty miles off the coast with hurricane force Gus already reaching the shore a surge of sea water likely to be the worst to the east side of the hurricane could be as high as fourteen feet\nSo if they did it it's a very serious I'm a charge indeed that's been brought against them\nIt sounds like it's going to be colorful case they defended their names are run the robo cop incest and in ... out of their shots they use ... names and lingo to boast about whacking and double teaming\nHa ha ha yeah tell us about or any evidence sounds very strong because they also have a star witness\nYeah the the evidence is actually quite compelling I mean it often is but this is even more compelling than usual it's on the one hand you have a ... a an actual a very believable witness because he was himself supposedly part of the cartel in what was the one who decided to like keep using the language here since we're talking about like horse he decided to rat out\nOf ... uh in in in return for a lighter sentencing themselves so they've got an eye witness in that sense radical ... spears or\nA conspiracy or the other thing is they have evidently lots and lots and lots of recorded telephone conversation and indeed you guys at Bloomberg it put some of those sort of snippets of some of those conversations up on the Web so people can actually you know your listeners can actually go and listen to some of those ... cells that will be evidence at trial and again it seems pretty incriminating\nShow what could the defense be beside the old they haven't proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt\nYeah so I I'm frankly quite skeptical that there can be any good defense but my understanding is what they're planning on doing is arguing either that they were just joking show that the government is actually you know sort of taken a the conversations that they have access to now\nOut of context and that sort of missing the bigger picture or that the government is sort of exaggerating the degree to which they actually manipulated or change the crisis\nOf the problem with both of those lines of defense are again I mean there's as much evidence that the government seems to have here is going to be pretty difficult to say oh this is just a matter of something that you pick up contacts in other words the government can actually provide the entire contacts\nAnd then as far as the matter of well we didn't actually end up in the later change the price that much or a alter anything were to make anybody lose anybody that also is quite critical that's easy enough to determine through the records\nShow the government has cracked down as you mentioned on market manipulation haven't worked it cleaned up the industry\nIt doesn't seem to have done so yet June I mean in theory it onto but it doesn't seem to work so hard I think is very simple reason and that is so far they simply penalized the institutions themselves right the banks themselves or the other institutions himself\nAnd again in theory that should work but the problem is that the games that are there to be had through them and they feel as behavior typically dwarf the awards or the settlements that are actually reached and what that means is that the companies themselves tend to view the stupidest one of the cost of doing business right it's just the kind of a a payoff\nI'm the only way I think you're really gonna change the behavior is if you go after the individual themselves which of course is what's happening here if you go after the individuals who make the actual decisions and they're faced with the possibilities suspension from the industry prohibition from the industry her barge money money fines or even a prism and I'm In the final extreme\nThat I think might actually be experienced a as pain and us might actually altered behavior\nGives it to change the u._k. officials draw their criminal investigation saying there wasn't enough evidence but from what we out of the trial you know evidence there is a lot of evidence\nYeah I have to say that was a bit of a puzzle to me as well um I was aware of that decision and what they what they say that I think I might have even talked you guys about it was very strange and the best I can make of it is that maybe um you know that it's a standard of proof is a bit more difficult in the u._k. maybe because the particular offensive\nStandard of proof is a bit more difficult in the u._k. maybe because the particular event that there was a tribe or would have been a penalize people with imprisonment of some sort and typically in a case like that yeah the the courts or the system is a bit more demanding the occupation but when you're talking about a regulatory infraction which is what we're really starting off with your\nStandard of proof isn't quite as high but and and and so in theory the Brits are driven able to do to particularly given again that the evidence they have right now seems to me like it would be enough it's believed unbelievable I'm even to secure a criminal conviction right let alone a regulatory one\nSo explain that the U.S one guilty pleas from for banks no individual staying here for the prosecutors are there other cases in the wings is it just the you know the effect it will have on traders\nRather than a couple of things right the first is starting to start with the last thing you know to be back them traitors I think would be significant that the government to Britain which again look at Johns\nI'm up in the ... it'd be kind of a wake up call because this would be the first time in quite some time that you know uh some of the kinds of marketing and ... and other ones that sort of scandalous activities that various sects ... sectors of the financial services urban occasion\nActually results in penalties against individuals I think it'll be a real sea change I think we've become so used to having institutions allies\nPeople become a bit complacent that a lot more willing to take risks of climate some of these people in doing so I think they're going to be affected immediately because it's a real qualitative shift as soon as we started actually securing a better getting penalties limit against individuals\nI thought well OK okay you've\nGot

I. A. broker dealer that's when the genie ... award for highest an independent advisor satisfaction among financial investment firms five times in Iraq that kind of left dot com\nFor more information I got to dig a little deeper into the trade today perfect came to do that job wise in the markets editor Bloomberg News he's of course it also coast\nBudget mess that comes to your way for him last time on Bloomberg TV Dave Wilson\nStocks at Bloomberg News enter Bloomberg interactive brokers studio so well out we expected more volatility they share Joe this is exactly what we've got to eyes there's something that's significant\nA about the move markets down a ... day I'm looking at the essence of the way down below that Ninety Days ... that I think last week\nYeah I mean it's interesting because there are some fundamental stories today out there that\nReally speak to what uh people are concerned about so the warning from companies like fast and all the industrial is really getting hit and they're getting hit because what they're saying is what people are most worried about\nThings with China things with labor costs things with transportation costs if you were to focus on one ... exactly right\nNow there's another aspect of what's going on which is continuing liquidation of the really the formerly hot stocks and so if you're a visa and MasterCard which they've talked about earlier this week but also the squares and ... these were some of the hottest\nStocks on the market and a lot of people are long them and their liquidation mode to I say what we're looking at today is a combination of some real fundamental concerns plus some selling\nWinter which had a guest coming up a market gas later on who's going to talk about like if you if you take out some of the really top performers in the indices in the market um Davey\nThen they're worse than the market doesn't look so overvalued in fact it might even be flat on the I think they're looking at growth and value I forgive me for not getting a specific site please just pointing out that we're still concentrate on the move up in stocks is year\nRight and of course there are those it'll tell you that concentration extends to how indexes have performed at a relative handful of shares right our response from from from the gauge now whether that is borne out by you know running through the numbers are not at the very least it it is a concern that's out there\nAnd knew Joe mentioned you know the other issues several of them anyway which broke commodity prices into the mix or you know had a to B gee industries the paint maker yesterday out talking about how was that hurting their results and and then the third quarter\nAnd some of the other issues that the the Joe Manchin certainly popped up there too so you're you're sort of at\nThe point where you're getting kind of the bad\nNews honoring the where the focus is on\nThe concerns that are out there or whatever companies have to say that doesn't quite measure up rarely gets people's attention because if you just looked at festivals or these cells you find out they beat analyst average as soon as the Bloomberg surveys on the west\nThe stocks down by ... percent is taking down its peers as well WW Granger HD Supply\nEmbassy industrial direct their all lower so\nYou know the concern is certainly out there even though ... if you kind of went through the numbers in detail you might scratch your head about exactly why\nSo many investors don't totally have it right\nWell we'll see the focus is an avid shifts once we get more\nActual results me for my fast so the first company in the U.S to be five hundred a report for the third quarter we get delta tomorrow then the end of the week is\nThree to four big financial companies Citigroup Jay Morgan and Wells Fargo so you know there's a lot to get through and it's a question of whether so this mindset of investors shows up as we get more and more results to consider\nIt gets it kind of got mad at her every segment financial management he says if you take out the top line growers from the large kept ... universal Russell I'm thousand grab the indexes that must fight here a day to just his point about he\nGot it like kind of look away from uh where are the highly concentrated movers ins marketplace had been one thing I Do want to put out there that Joe and I'm going to talk about this or that I guess a little bit later on as you got stocks and bonds falling together we don't see this often [noise] right\nThat's exactly right so there's no place to hide in this market right now because\nThe stock the bottom part of your portfolio is probably also selling off very reminiscent of course of what we saw in February in that respect in fact we've hit I think this is my third period this year when volatility really picked up\nAnd there was no place to hide which I think speaks to the concerns that that risk is on the upside for inflation so if you're worried about deflation or ... and\nThen when you sell off your stocks here like what you feel comfortable going into bonds right but if you're worried about inflation and you still overstock so you're like well balanced on how much either 'cause uh inflation's get\nYour way at the coupon so I think that because that that's the theme of this year when we get the volatility spike it does speak to upside concerns that being said there is a short circuit in fact I think a little bit where you get this like shark\nSo off in bonds that leads to a sell off inequities and that creates a little bit of saving buying in treasuries and so the rise and rage ironically leads to eventually fallen right\nYeah exactly save\nThis sounds like my short of the day off the vine up so well I appreciate it yeah I mean sure beyond that one of the things you have to keep in mind when you look at the stock market this past week with all the people we've seen in treasuries\nIt'd be one or what sort of leading the parade among the main industry group and he has to be five hundred it's utility stocks and you talk about a group that is affected by where rates are going that's certainly it in fact\nI'm looking at us at the bottom or utilities index of the past five days of three point seven percent it's one of only three groups in the index attire real estate consumer samples of the other two and a common denominator there\nAgain it's they tend to be relatively defensive enraged sensitive so it's interesting to see those groups do as well as they have like\nAll right so beyond the markets a joke is certainly one of our stories today what else do you read it\nOh I mean that's pretty much is there anything else going on in the world today besides yourself you know what I'm really interested dorm there's that there's during the storm but I'm also really interested in the Saudis story and the missing journalist because what I Wonder about this in the news or am I Wonder what I'm Wondering is\nIf this could look extreme this would be extremely bad if it turned out to be confirmed that\nWhen you're on the report the reports about him getting killed and you wonder about whether it could be a creek economic problems further for the kingdom if businesses don't want to do things after this I think it's going to be a pretty explosive story that we haven't heard the end of\nRight and this was missing critic cranking critical as Saudi Arabia and then ...\nAnd it hasn't been confirmed but the report that he was killed\nBy exactly the same thing we're following David ... said\nJoe real estate developer Bruce Berkowitz Farah ...\nSaid Joe real estate developer\nBruce Berkowitz fare home he's the chairman his funds have a controlling stake stocks down for ... percent they are right in the heart of the hurricane that's where they're real estate projects are so that's going to be one to watch over the next few days\nI'm just gonna say with a bunch of stuff in Bloomberg Businessweek magazine this weekend looking at a climate change and also what investors are doing to kind of position themselves\nTo take advantage of some of the trends ... Dave Wilson thank you so much uh the markets by the day quickly one number that tells us a lot at six hundred and fifty million ten cents investment team and discussions to read the new dollar denominated fund of at least that amount I let's get to your well the national news headlines about go Hi, Bob\nSet up um I don't know a red light you are a little warning sign\nWe do have some uneasiness I think on bond trading desks or across the world because of what we've seen in the treasury market and we have some heavy supply tomorrow I Know and the third year auctions and we have CPI tomorrow morning right and if you think about it the treasury move that we've seen year today penny tenure yields are up about eighty basis points\nHasn't really been driven by inflation\nIt's been driven more by I think strong economic growth in a re pricing of fed expectations right that's\nWhat's been driving treasury yields so now on the eve of media isn't it or is it not that it's failed again it's real versus inflation's moving it or what well I just think now traders are sitting around thinking well tomorrow we get CPI if we get any signs that inflation is bouncing back or even picking up\nMore than expected that would be another leg I think up in treasury yields so that's the uneasiness that we did we see here on the eve of the the CPI report\nAnd is that why we're seeing some of the nervousness within the equity ... yeah it's still low though by historical yes perspective that's why\nWouldn't you think your question was is this a ... a warning sign or I think it's noise that's temporary there is some discomfort there are some uneasiness with is the word I Would use in in the bond market but also in the equity markets\nAnd that will sort itself out I think the fundamental question is is the economy on the cusp of a slowdown are we going to see a weakening of growth\nThat's the scenario I Would be more worried about are we I don't see that why we're a hundred and twelve months into this cycle I think will grow it about three percent for the full twenty Eighteen there'll be the best\nYears of growth in this cycle we could grow at two and a half percent next year and that would mean this will be the longest cycle on record so it's not about to end I don't see any signs\nThat we're following two to show us at the end is near what keeping it going well the consumer looks excellent him to consumers still spending that are pretty good clip down to a fundamental driver business ... holding up pretty well we expect that to maybe even pick up a little bit\nIf we can only get some help from in the residential housing side that's been something missing from the cycle backward extended\nWell give me let's go there because I was listening to Bloomberg Radio this morning they were talking about the home builders have really taken a beating now mind you\nI think back last year and you saw them do a pretty significant run up what's going on in the housing sector is it not enough supply what is it I think the only ...\nI think the knee jerk reaction when rates go up when you have a a maybe an unexpected to some ... moving treasury yields who will say oh you have higher rates who's going to be hurt and then they start up\nSelling off the the people they think will be hurt\nAnd you I think the first thing that people react as old home sales will declined people aren't going to be able to purchase a home get higher mortgage re that or is that happening well actually today maybe in the mortgage or purchase up cases that we've seen the ah we see a little tick up in the mortgage applications so it's possible\nIt's possible that story plays out that higher rates\nKeep people from buying however I don't I don't know I think this jury is still out on that story\nBut if it does okay so walk along this path with me if indeed that's what's happening and people are not going to be buying homes that's a big catalyst for economic growth rate you buy a home you bet you fill it with a lot of junk and all that stuff I mean if we see that does that say something to you about where we are in this economic cycle and subsequently this market cycle\nI think you've identified one of the biggest risk to my rosy view that I just laid out for you before\nThe ... the housing sector has been a great leading indicator for the U.S economy and so if that starts to weaken more materially than I think that would be that would be the red flag alert that I'll be looking more at and I I don't think that's going to play out but it's a risk\nUm that's a risk okay and then\nYou know this has been such a different market cycle because became off the financial crisis you had the fed doing X Y Z and grow up with central banks doing X Y Z\nUm does the next downturns we've any indication can we look into a crystal ball and say okay it's going to be like other market downturns we've seen or was it a few months ago so much that it's going to be a blip if we get one\nI don't think it's going to be like two thousand and eight I don't do the thing that was unique about two thousand and they was it was a seizing up of the global financial doesn't have to be too doesn't make me half of that it can be a third of that and yes and if I could be more like you don't you go back and look at the two thousand two thousand one recession on the GDP chart now it does look like a blip so it could be more of a ... type issue though but I Want\nNow it does look like a blip so it could be more of a ... type issue though but I when I'm sitting here thinking about risks and where those might show up you want to look for sectors that are over extended where people are taking on debt\nIn order to make investments where is that well I see you have a big opportunity for perhaps a big red warning flag would be corporate debt corporate dead as a share of GDP is at all time highs so that is something to keep an eye on what would be a possible candidate\nUm globally you have some economies that have have taken more debt Adam and credit has grown more quickly right could be\nIs that corporate ... the United states more manageable because I'm just thinking how everybody kind of reservists their debt when rights were so low we said well that's a great thing about ten seconds yeah I think it's a different animal than the mortgage debt of the last cycle so I think even though corporate debt to GDP as high as I said yeah I think it it will be fine and\nWe still like the corporate sector of the bond market bottom

two hundred and fifty miles to the southwest\nBut the ... addict activity yeah make sure we cover for that eastern eastern Georgia eastern South Carolina eastern North Carolina\nOr these tornados as as the storm winds down in the lower levels still very strong and the upper levels so what happens is that discrepancy creates these border see these ones that twos and so you get these higher costs with that and you have tornadoes it wouldn't be surprised if there are a couple of dozen tornadoes tonight and tomorrow\nIn the area south and east and and so so the rainfall I'm Sorry I'm I'm you know just found this information now it's like there's so much coming in I Can't\nCan't get it out here are the rainfall three to six locally twelve inches off from a from where we are in Georgia as far in Georgia now but through South Carolina to North Carolina and a lot of that area that was devastated by Florence other coastal areas\nProbably aren't going to get it as bad they are going to get pretty strong wind gust in there but this is just inland until we get to the lives of the city and you folks in tide water very like tomorrow night and on friday morning you're going to get north when's coming in their sixty ... Seventy miles an hour right now in Chesapeake Bay because there's this reaches the coast\nAnd those same professional effects on talking about overland diminish the storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay healthier there'll be a nor'easter from a deep sea to to Boston\nTell me because I really what ... what are the areas that that may have ... tornado activity exactly so people can make preparations and be ready\nWell south in ... south and east of a path let's say from Columbus, Georgia or to Greenville Spartanburg I think ah to Raleigh Durham\nTo the tide water Virginia you live south and east of that path and the further south east to go the more the more you have to watch out for that you're going to see tornado watches and warnings be put into effect in those areas and a over the next several hours I Believe they'll start putting that out\nOf putting that out there if they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches\nAnd trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into fought it yeah\nAll right now I Want to just go through this very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is that pounded hard the the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast and as it moves north east is going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through a gun on\nA hundred mile a hundred two hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty to a hundred and\n... then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the the north east coast or to the Carolinas I guess through the tip Columbia through uh the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City two AM in the morning on friday and then about a hundred miles east and north in the morning or seven AM eight AM\nAnd then on out to sea and a glancing blow a a you know they're like a nor'easter for three to six maybe eight hours or New Jersey on in the southeast New England out of this and this is the last this is the last one showing so you don't have\nTo work I didn't know was the last one that fascinates me that you said it's the last one this isn't going to happen for the rest of the year\nWhile we knew back in September that we're going to have one come up out of the Caribbean because it's the overall pattern and I'll tell you what folks if we've been in the sense is two thousand and two all over again except slowly\nSlowly which was the big hurricane in the Gulf hit a little bit earlier in Louisiana and October but we had all the warm weather in September and October this is pointing the way believe it or not\nThis is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big winter for much of the United states this year they there's certain types of patterns is set up so it it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm\nThat will then establish it we may see something that tries to develop but stay or most likely stay offshore before it's all said and done but impacts dorms on the United states\nThis is the last one in my opinion\nJob of starting you're helping to save people's lives and uh you help everyday you nailed this with the exact pinpoint perfection an accuracy which is so vital for the people that make proper decisions about whether to stay or go Oh thank you for being with us we really appreciate we'll get back to you later Oh thank you for having me showing\nAlright eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program there is\nA really disturbing piece on the law and crime website and stay in Abrams website That's a sister Web sites of media hype\nAnd it chronicles the FBI Director who's testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency\nNow you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not\nBut that's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring\nThe FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump\nAnd during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember when he was first in office they were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible to ... the president's conversations with international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to in this Saturday\nWell then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that most senator I'm quite confident that we are conducting ourselves in a manner of consistent with the law in the constitution a that's a subject to extensive oversight\nI don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations and then Rand Paul as director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up by\nThe intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with say a terrorist naming them and re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical well that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director off and said the answer is yes\nAnd as this time with right was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abuse within the ... system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is has James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant\nInformation you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar there is no war it\nThere's no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it on a domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years\nOn a domestic crime that has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought ... was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ\nThat would literally be weaponized sing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect the people\nAnd I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate can put together a flimsy dot CA\nWith Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer Warren application but not one for the original application and three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information\nWas bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified at corroborated but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it bites wearing you know we'll get into this you know with chairman Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that\nThis is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant the bar is even higher when it comes to a buys a surveillance warrant\nAnd what has happened here is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal ever\nNow we've got three people on record saying that Rod Rosenstein well he has a plan hatched to surreptitiously record the president the hopes that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and he won't even testify under oath said no and Congress is letting we got to let him get away with that Trey Gowdy is going to let them get away with that\nPartly sunny Thursday forty

judges\nBack to people who believe in the constitution and who believe in America there's only affecting if Mitch McConnell's the leader I mean the key is done this year where President Trump is truly historic on our holiday and it's not just the Supreme Court justice all the others do a shrill\nOh though we were able to finally have a success and she even a victory last week but that that doesn't\nThat's just the beginning\nOf the fact is that the president and the Senate majority leader have worked together to move almost one out of every four federal judges towards a more constitutional more conservative more American\nInterpretation of the ... of of of the mall and this is a remarkable achievement if the Democrats would lend as soon as I said it really complicated when you've got quite a certain running in Tennessee saying oh I'm really a lot well who's going to vote for ... for short\nPeriods the Democrat Arizona she says ... tumor\nBoth what does that mean that means not a single column judge will move forward not a single Trump will come on for so controlled the Senate\nIs absolutely vital if in fact you want to continue to move towards a poem or in the constitution of conservatism which I think what I find the help ... election about sixteen\nA to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think you're saying is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nYou've you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you are not and bring 'em in and put them on ...\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenas then McCain memos and the kitten was or what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting that Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have in the Cape memos that reinforce that\nWe've subpoenaed that became memos and we've asked ... to come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr Rogers is leading that you played Shawn he talked about friends he talked about facts and and the hearing to this and how our our our rule of law and justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency showing the document give us the Cape memos and more importantly come answer our questions that's what bothers both of us\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\n[noise] well I can tell you that committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house majority leader of the house\nA Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA that we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that uh it's it's more ... on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and ...\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan\nThat you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states in the hopes that it would\nProvide materials that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running this department\nShould not be joking with support it's about\nRecording the commander in chief of the United states\nThat ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do that particularly at the time that this was happening remember this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on may night the president fires give them call me on may seventeenth ... Bob Mueller the special counsel that there is one of the things you enjoy it happen in between there\nRemember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was a menial leaks strategy\nSo that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we've got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only were they leaking arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there\nAre a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies an application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they will read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this of course the ... deals\nYou know ... and as a result that was used as the bulk of information to attain that\nDeals you know dot CA and as a result was used as the bulk of informational pain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given the British or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Broussard knew that some of the things that he was writing there or not accurate and and yet somehow they get\nPut in a a three oh two and they get used as debts a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick it truly is sickening\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appeared tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf a book in the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte do indicated that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these\nImportant questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we can ask the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath\nAnd want to talk about your
