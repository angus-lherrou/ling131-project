to weigh man specifically about the anger of women in light of the me too movement in light of Brett Kavanaugh and also we take a look at some misconceptions when it comes to women and investing gas swimming they'll take on risk\nPlus brewing up a recovery that's in our pursuit section but first\nAgain\nWhere did they take that recording of a thing I I Am I saying just a reminder that we should stick to our Dajani really should know singing\nAt Peter coy though he is our go to gun and all things economics and he's got a pretty provocative piece this week about the almighty dollar the almighty\nDollar that's right and despite the plane kind of a smaller role chase it in our global economy the u._s. dollar still reigned Supreme even that many around the globe prefer another option it got more from Peter\nTo dollar is amazing the U.S share moral GDP has fallen basically since World War two when it was sky high\nAnd a kind of roller coaster up and down way a and yet the dollar is rural is gone and somebody just as important as it was so in Breton woods or move being formed\nIt's it's used in transactions for example um European company might buy a European product and yet priced in dollars boiling gold price in dollars\nMost countries have the majority of their reserves of foreign currency reserves in dollars us being one of the only exceptions obviously we were ours isn't gold\nA and overall the dollar is the currency everybody links to even Russia when it's moving around and sex change re tries to kind of stay in line with a dollar and of course the Chinese you on\nA loving your story to say that even like Somali pirates take our ship what they want as ... dollars for a while to us get to be here I mean is it just a case of transparency security\nIt's both of those you know some of his historical uh goes back to first world war one and then even more World War two for the U.S displaced the British pound\nAnd Dr ... for a spring up Serena Williams which I Love the fact that you brought that into the war because it was such a notable cultural moment not just a sports moment at the U.S open just a few weeks ago here in New York\nYeah so she talks a lot about in the book about how women are treated differently when they're angry than men are and usually we're judged for it or a cat dies for it\nOr it's dangerous or evil or whatever have you and I thought the ... example was a really good example of how women are treated differently when they get angry and when they're angry for justifiable reasons she got angry\nBecause she doesn't think she was being treated fairly or playing very well and that as a totally valid emotion for her to have and yet we had like a week's news cycle about it and a press conference and she was fine so it just felt like a really good example of how female anger is treated differently than mailing and\nThat one was so interesting to me too because there was\nEffectively definitive proof that she was treated differently from it by the same person so there was like a control group there where an umpire had faced similar things from a male player versus Serena and he had acted differently so I I Love that example it's really good what's interesting is\nYou see it all the time like a man gets angry and it's kind of respected for fighting for something a woman gets angry and now like what's her problem and we see that come out at the same time but I Love that in in this review in this book it sounds like is that anger can be an incredible\nSource for change and we've seen it whether it comes to you know unions whether it comes to racial inequalities we've seen it throughout our history that anger we see it now to me too movement that anger can be effective so we shouldn't suppress it\nYeah that's definitely her argument and I think she says the reason that women's anger so demonized is because it's so powerful strain on such a powerful force for change she argues throughout history and then yeah specifically over the last two years she points to the me too movement and how women are really\nAngry and it has already led to changes you know we've seen the women's march and we've seen a lot more women run for office we talk about somebody like\nRosa Parks can we think of her as being very quiet woman who made a stand like it's an interesting history kind of represents everything when it comes to women yeah and she she's done\nBut it's not how Rosa Parks was up apparently Rosa Parks was an activist and she wasn't just the quite women who got fed up she was angry\nAll right so in addition to being angry you're also very prolific another piece in the magazine string Bloomberg ... because it talks about\nA century gender stereotypes when it comes to investing we have these perceptions and how women invest versus men women being risk averse men being more ... when it comes to investing\nVersus men women being risk averse\nMen being more ... when it comes to investing the number say otherwise\nLike that yeah we think women are risk averse lemon ... but there are two big piece of data and a story one company and risk alive which\nA lot of financial planners use to measure the rest of their clients\nAnd you think five million people data from this company found that women fall really evenly across the risk spectrum so there are about the same amount of women who are high risk takers as our lowest pickers with our medium risk taker idea that women and fall and the conservative and as just\nCompletely false um\nThe data and find that men do fall a little bit more in the high risk side but another piece of data from this investing ... stash found that in their behavior is exactly the same men and women are just as risque on that and ...\nSo even so the perception even fragments perception of themselves and doesn't match up with their actual actions right\nYeah women present themselves at risk averse and I think we just internalize this this thinking that we don't like to take risks and more conservative and I and I have a couple and the and the story where they the woman come in and she is like you know conservative at my husband's from Iraq and it turned out to the exact opposite the woman was\nWilling to take what's sad to think about it if a woman comes in and says I think you know I'm risk averse and she works with a financial planner and so they're like okay we're just going to put her in safe dodgy investments you know she might certainly impact herself financially her wealth over the long term if not necessarily putting more aggressive investments which he really could deal with that\nYeah there's a band investing at like there's all sorts of another one and it finds that when fewer women had invested in general and the women who had invested it hadn't messed up by us money and and it couldn't be because of these ... that are getting pushed on land and or you say or South America whereas I don't want to invest at all and you don't want\nThat to happen so how does this get broken down\nHow do we think that yeah so yeah we should push back against the stereotypes that women should realize that they are at risk averse um and and that's\nTo get angry over yeah actually where we started I was going to synthesize well done about that and you also talked to sound like contact which I Know we often like to do when it comes to women and investing story so it was her take on all of that project ... says well known in in the wall street community\nShe is about the last thing and that's to set back the math and she just knows that the the Mets aren't real women need to invest and because that we've been left out of the financial industry for so long that we really need to push back and and get it back\nAnd Sally is such an interesting example two of the structural gap that exists because as you say\nAll across the street especially senior levels this lack of women does affect so many the product offerings the risk strategies at banks themselves and how they talk to their customers such good inside ... thank you as always thank you\nYou are listening to Bloomberg Businessweek coming up

New York Times has done a story on this to Trump\nIn his wealth the weather has been re doesn't where it is and how many people who screwed up along the way when he went bankrupt et cetera et cetera et cetera et cetera I don't notice anything new here is anybody\nThere is no singer ... sister coming here this year I think she was a\nA up for being a judge somewhere then I guess her filing says of her tax returns of the family business\nThat's really what kind of started all of this death started as down the road here we are and so where does lead Victoria whereas if there were like well in in New York the rumor is that there really isn't anything to it's all been reconciled and there really isn't anything that they are going to go out there who now I don't think that there's going to be a whole lot\nTo what are you hearing your Washington Victoria Jones about there's anything\nWell I mean in Washington you know the IRS ah I I don't think you can really do and I think at the time but they are ... ... people that that they look very closely at that because\nNot only was so don't you think Scott I'm In that are in the Trump so well but it does save lives by the sound of illegal but it's been done what is it the most interesting story about this in this\nStory about Trump's well\nIt's set in well in that store that story has created which is brilliant brilliant is almost entirely miss\nThat she only go to one million dollar loan what in fact it was the right point seven million yeah that was nearly all a that it was we paid but then all of it but that would bring in fact he was by age ... he was two hundred thousand dollars a year\nOr he was a millionaire by age eight I'm ... you know it's just fascinating to how he tried to get his father decided to call it the cell changing his Whalen basic could better I think Donald Trump or when his father was in his nineties and ailing setting off a sadly you\nI'm just very interesting off his father had done nothing to help him out on bail out and say this but says throughout his life it's just it's just absolutely it's fascinating fascinating family story is what it is like family story\nHere we go I'm a of the opinion that this sort of thing\nHappens all the time I don't think there's anybody who believes Donald Trump is the world's greatest humanitarian\nNor great stand up guy and Victor anybody on any side either side of the Iowa who thinks that you are in terms of his wealth and the phony baloney stuff that he's created around them so you got to hand it to the guy\nHe's a great PR person for himself or he knows how to sell himself he knows how to tell the story of how much of it is true how much of it is baloney remains to be seen as just one more reason for people either not to like um you know so you look at what he's all about he's\nNot a likeable guy but let me tell you Harry in spite of that why he's popular with his base\nYeah because he doesn't care what you think of him maybe try going out to be all that all of that means he does not care what you think of him here going to do what he thinks is right and whether it's wrong or right he's going to do it and he doesn't care whether people are stopping\nAt the White House gates with flames\nTrying to charge the gates he will do what he wants to do and that's what his base loves is that they think\nThe things that he's doing or the right

accounts were compromised yet again ah what in the name of God is going on there\nAnd why is it with all of these questions I Know the numbers have gone down on Facebook but they don't seem to be going down appreciably and one wonders why because they seem to be very well have just gotten to shore themselves what is going on there\nWell in terms of numbers one of the reasons why Facebook's numbers have they've definitely dropped off\nBut in the older demographic they has not because that's for two reasons one older people don't know how to disconnect and delete an account on Facebook and that's actually I'm not making a joke that is a very real thing\nAnd the second thing is for a lot of older people that is still their lifeline of communication with family across the country or around the world and so those numbers of the older generation are always going to be there on Facebook\nBut for a lot of younger people they've just you know pulled the plug\nAnd and you just keep hearing these stories time and time again that they've been hacked and the security isn't good\nAnd you know and again going back to the older generation using Facebook they're probably still using password one so they're even more vulnerable and they don't even realize that\nAnd I go and they don't change their passwords they never change it right you have to change your passwords\nOn a regular basis I you know get my mom to try to she's not even on Facebook but if she was to get her to change your password you know it's all I've got this sheet we're right on my password around you know it's just it's never going to happen so unfortunately there are a lot of people who are very very vulnerable to all kinds of\nMalware and that you know all kinds of stuff this is going to be that and\nWe live with forever yeah and it just it is it's going to be something that we have to learn how to deal with and the way you deal with it as you change your password and your right your user name or at least a couple of times a year yeah\nCan I can I also said something very creepy I'm about Facebook which is that they've asked people to use to fact set identification and I'm In\nOregon id number out of your finger some print something to log in on the computer and then you get a text to your phone yeah and you and then you say yes this is me on your phone and computer says okay you can get in so is that good or bad return it it's good\nWell in theory in theory it's good but what Facebook has done is that uh they had been out to it\nAnd call it a whole settling the phone numbers yeah [laughter] well being used for two facts to identification in other words to make a veiled most ... kill two appetizers\nYeah there are a bunch of the really really really made it has to be able to get to get all of them down in ...\nRight I I mean I I I'm Still on Facebook because I like to say occasionally will my nephews that do it I don't use Facebook anymore I I Am so\n... ... but I got done with him when he announced a few years ago\nOh well you'll stream it no longer going to be a linear oh what happened to you know an eye on their way out going to determine what you're interested in and I said no you know I I see a variety of things\nI don't want you get ... on other than the ...\nOr ... ... ... in a social graph oh one K. and showing up fights talking thing a bunch of boring stuff along that line\nIs I Want to see why why not seeing and the thing from Carol any mall\nArrogance with two thousand people at the same couple hundred people are kind of ... who was who like myself who I see their content it's what happened to the other Eighteen hundred people I'm friends with now I\nIf you kill yeah\nSo and that's right who comes up as your friends I Want to know where they get I get that I Love the people that come up when I look at my Facebook page my personal favorite because people I talked to any of them I don't know [laughter] you know there may be listening who knows who they are\nUh is really silly but there's one thing that I Want to mention before we pause here and that has to do with where the Facebook and other social media come into our society come into our lives the story this week of a third grader who brought a loaded\nHandgun into a an elementary school because he wanted to scare the children who are picking on him and where that went in terms of social media the instead of curtailing yet\nControlling it he goes out for everybody to see and in my mind this gives other people the idea to get a hold of a hand gun\nTo do the same thing I think that's what social media does it spreads bad ideas and there's no sifting there were some good ideas and loving things that are there and I promote and I put up on my personal page but there are a lot of things there at all\nAngry at that age is ... television news ah everything does that\nSpreads ideas in bed\nBy forty six past the hour I'm going to help you lose some weight now

[noise]\nUh in in this book that just came out with time let's say paranormal personal history I document thirty four different experiences paranormal experiences I've had since age for\nWhere you abused as a child sexually\nAh yes\nYou think that has anything to do with the escapism involved with paranormal acts\nYou think that has any thing to do with the escapism involved with paranormal activity\nNo because the paranormal activity started before that\nStarted or age for have you filed\nCriminal charges against the adults who did that to you\nKnow have you gotten revenge\nAh I I don't I don't think it was necessary [laughter]\nI Know Dr Bruce when you live a paranormal experience would you please share with this one just one extraordinary paranormal experience that happened to you in celebration of Halloween please share that with us\nSure ah well I can talk about the first one that that was that age for a I was in northern Norway\nTwo hundred miles above the Arctic Circle where my parents are from we're visiting my grandmother was winter time and I was outside plane and I got started to feel very sick\nSo I went home and uh by the time I got to my grandmother's house\nMy neck was stiff and or had body aches a high fever I went to lie down on this little bed my grandmother had in the kitchen\nAnd ah that's where she took naps I guess when she was cooking but anyway I I was lying down in the the relatives started coming over and saying things like oh this is what happened to your cousin when he got polio\nAnd this is what happened to your older brother when he got sick and died the next day so they were just scaring the heck out of me\nAnd uh my grandmother my mother was very upset and I kind of drifted off into asleep and then I woke up\nA few hours later and ah I saw this really bright light up in the ceiling\nBetween the beams and this old farmhouse\nAnd the ceiling and it was very warm and it was very bright it was in the ...\nWhat I Would call in and jelly shape and kind of a humanoid shape and uh I the best thing about it was that I felt like everything would be okay I didn't have any more worries I I I I felt fine I went back to sleep and when I woke up in the morning I was completely well I didn't have any\nAny health issues at all and my mother and my grandmother said it was a a\nA miracle and that was my guardian angel and I I think that's what open the floodgates uh\nFor the rest of my life I started having these paranormal experiences are quite\nOften and uh uh uh you know kind of randomly but but very often frequently\nShare it with us a recent paranormal experience Dr Bruce\nSure ah well I Am able to um as soon as I published this book well okay I'll I'll what\nCaused me to to write this book or a friend of mine a dear friend of mine are also of of a Norwegian heritage ah passed away two years ago and uh a month after he died I ah had a vision of him and he came to me\nAnd it was very clear vision of him and he told me all about his the spirit world you know his uh his after like what is after life was like and it was quite detailed\nAnd a ... he he actually gave me the is the name of the book timeless that's that comes from my friend gene but uh he told me that in in the spirit world that he was in there is there's no there's no future there is no past it just as he said I just am\nIt's just all the present everything is just president\nAnd he said it was it was very it was a very nice and uh he had no more\nBut I don't know if I stop stop stop Dr talking to Dr yeah\nDr Bruce all of sold ... has written a book called ... paranormal personal history I don't care about his history told me about your history tell me about a paranormal experience that happened to you\n\nWhile this division Adam and was was the paranormal experience I can tell you about it a demonic experience that I had\nYes a loved about eight to ... to specially way especially if you're driving an Eighteen wheeler through the Pennsylvania wilds or ... eighty or an eye twenty through Dallas those those are the ones we want to hear please share with us a demonic experience doctor\nOkay sure so uh I was Eighteen years old living in my brother's garage I was at a very low point in my life\nAnd a sleeping on the mattress on the on the garage a floor and ah all of a sudden a this column fire appeared or from the foot of the mattress or my feet were and and went in an arc over my head\nAs so probably you know I don't know when six feet up in the air and in art and it was it was moving like a like a river of fire and there was this low guttural voice was speaking in some kind of language I didn't understand\nAnd uh I I pinch myself I slap myself just to make sure I was awake and I was awake and this probably went on for about five minutes although it seems longer than that it was it was terrifying and and I uh\nI got up and I I called my girlfriend and I told her what had happened and then she told me to come over and she was quite worried about me she said come over in the morning and uh I did and then when I was there she told me well you should maybe we should call a psychiatrist and I said well just forget about it you know don't worry about it maybe it was just a dream but if it\nWasn't it was real higher and I think what no I've yeah he was call them ... you know with all of our fire engulfed you while you were sleeping while you were in bed well\nIt was like a river of fire a column that went over my head in an arc shape it wasn't a engulfing he was over me you know\nThis is talk of Bruce all over so high now the reason I Want to Dr Bruce on because every hour I get a pitch from somebody who's written a book who's had psychic experiences but the difference with Dr Bruce is Dr Bruce all of Solazyme is a big deal he's a Fulbright Scholar and professor\nBut he had to wait until his retirement to write this book\nAbout his paranormal personal history of the name of the book is timeless a paranormal personal history\nAnd he documents thirty four incidents of paranormal events in his life to let the the telecom nieces ghost demons guardian angels pre cognition near death experiences in much more it's quite a book but this was a real guy\nThis is a serious sacrament ACA diminish and this isn't a guy who who is in a this is a serious\nGuy now Dr saw\nYes share with us another story like the ... story ... you're saying there was a river of fire by your bed question about the river fire by your bed right before you saw that what were you doing when thinking did you do something to invoke the devil\nOr\nDon't believe so but I Do have a a theory about it because the day before actually the night before a I was a cutting through a yards like I usually do since I was a kid even when I was Eighteen years old they still did it jumped over fences and cut three yards this is in Seattle\nSuburbs in Seattle and uh or north of Seattle and I I cut through the yard of this a lady that the everybody all the kids call her a witch\nAnd uh she had like blackberry Bush's they went all the way to the top of her roof and it was horrifying to you

use providing a cheat sheet\nTo the fund and ensure that school can be to all those who are returning to school this month I Do like that\nVery well written a thank you nice to hear that sounds like you're ready to go back to school I I Would would you go back to school and I'm a whether it be college or high school doesn't matter and why is that old saying if uh you know I knew then what I knew now yes I Would I Would\nDo things a lot differently in college I Would not go back to high school to college for sure yeah I I Would a high school I think we\nDid well I don't know like in about ... von ... honestly uh that's I don't know if that's how that sounds but I had to find time in in high school we did lots of stuff we spoke about the last couple of shows are in a band we had lots of fun at parties and and uh we've been through the out of a cookie gun\nA routine though yeah we have to refer to talk about something maybe tell about that now just for kicks there was a while yeah so so if you hadn't heard prior episodes\nWe would hang around a lot after school because we had nothing to do and we were just you know create mischief or with other programs structured actual after school program which we wanted no part for safe and um\nYeah I mean we would even ah like\nI remember one time we went to a study hall for subject\nThat we weren't even taking the class and the teacher the subject we were like in the right and we were full of our our mission was to disrupt like peacefully disruptive and the teacher came around she goes to a gentleman you do you have this class and we like to know what are you doing here this is for studying the exam\nAnd we and we just said they were just hanging around and and they would know us after a while and they said the whole the thumb up and give us it's like you're out the umpire and we'd know the motion and we know we\nHad run out of almost every classes sooner or later we lose one of every activity\nEvery act after school I went to uh we were kind of the first wedding crash crash after school activities and\nIt was interesting it was very like teacher in a difficult environment for students really unruly\nWho's very uh ... of like it doesn't age well but it was an it's an\nInteresting time capsule and and something with the teacher was able to use certain tools to turn kids around\nA disservice love with just deport have sort of the same move right sickly exact uh and turn kids around and and and have them become better people and and so for the teachers do how that affects some\nSome do I mean you know good and bad baseball players good bad radio personalities and all that you know sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't so we're just taking a look at a at a little bit of teen Hangst in high school basically and I guess in college to ah but mostly in high school and how that\nUh we're up against now with with back to school here so I remember did you do this with us did you go to the Mac\nA library sure if it is so let's just place it was very little opportunity to see a movie on demand it's an old movie back in Nineteen Seventy nine death do VCRs ... he was around it was just developing and I don't think most people had it\nSo libraries which they still do this day played movies but that time they played them at nighttime it's seven o'clock or ... o'clock on a friday or Saturday Night\nSo we that's what we always did also was we took a look and I think it's a great idea for kids to do now is lip sync outside the box and not everything is about just going to the movie theater is doing what your parents that were to\nLook for yourself to see some adventures some things that you could do in your community what's you know what's happening around that could be even if you just go to play bingo could be a cake once when I was you know once a\nMoon whatever a blue moon but something different and so we said we had a ... gang of maybe ten people to traits so the ... library by us and watch rebel without a car I remember\nThe whole it has to take away your mind if I Try to slam the door in my face\nDon't buy everything you on a bicycle environmental thing on the line we love and affection don't lay all then what is it\nYou know you'll say why did they tell you I have now takes asked\nThe lady at the end just runs a chill up by ... by God I guess somebody's gonna make that comment about me and stuff all the time I was asked um what do you say you remember\nHow vivid like what do you remember about oh just remember just doing it would just it was cool that we were doing something like that I thought it was really cool it was probably your idea yeah and um so I Love the idea and the movie was so great like I had no idea I didn't know who James Dean was a I kind of had an idea\nThe movie was so great like I had no idea I didn't know who James Dean was a I kind of had an idea but when you actually see the movie on a relatively big screen and you and I were teenagers a good time to see that movie\nBecause you kind of connected to it in certain ways and just the idea that we did something out of the norm itself which was really great and I remember it to this day\nYeah that's that's what's amazing 'cause that's for forty ... whatever amount of years ago and like that and and it's close to forty years and I remember it as well or in most other people we went to do that\nWe went to I see the light show or in the van invented a planetarium earlier first time I heard a Led Zeppelin songs they played it in a planetarium it did back in the day I don't think they do it in like a laser light show how right there to music\nWhich was again something brand new no one ever did\nAnd they would change the music like it would be different music every night\nYeah this is the Beatles night or whatever it was and so that was great fun but yeah talking about ... though that movie does represent a lot of the ... that some kids unfortunately even from that that was in the sixties even from a from the sixties to this day experience home life is a little difficult\nParents aren't ah maybe on the same page all the time maybe parents aren't together it leads to a lot of this teenage ... which James Dean Natalie Wood and sell many oh in this movie really presented in a way that still I think universal I think in some ways\nAll the knife fights and stuff don't happen anymore too much other stuff going on in the way it was portrayed right but but I think that it it does still represent the struggles that that kids go through\nAnd even though Jim ... who's missing but go in there somehow the third from Africa Gilligan's Island but even he represents the father who is inept he's right upfront generation just not understanding\nWhat this child is going through and doing what he thinks is right the materialism thing journalistic things and I I give you support even earlier in that scene is\nHis his son his drunk and he's saying it's okay I did that when I was a kid too so he's trying what he can and there is no book to raising kids and so I don't I don't know that the the that the movie even is what is the father is still sympathetic in that movie right out of touch but he's trying\nThe grandmother or who made that last comment there's not so nice the wife is not so nice\nAnd so now you see what the struggle comes with your dad versus mom and my family so ah leaves the the kid in between so we've seen that in high school um I don't know if you have any experience has anything to share whatever if not we move on but the idea is that you know there's all of us have struggles\nAt that teen those teenage years that uh\nI don't know it's just hard because I haven't gone through it yet with my kids hard to know how to navigate through and what the right answer\nWhat is the other thing is that the kids when they when your kids are in high school they don't necessarily talk to you about what they're going right on through because I didn't really talk about with my parents too much ... I did but didn't express to them you know one tenth of what I was really\nGoing holding to if it ever got to the public was really bad something six something really happens or you did something really you know then that was the symptoms the last straw if you will that then you would release all of well I've been going through this the last month or whatever it is\nBut even just to be in touch with your feelings of what you're feeling into you're allowed to talk about it and maybe talking about it helps that was not in my world at\nAll now mine either no so so it gets it wasn't it wasn't because my parents wouldn't listen because it's the way I was I just didn't want to talk about it right and I was a teenager rice\nWas and what and what's talking going to do like that yeah that age yeah ... ... it's all about I Can't solve the problem by my parents are going to lead level though right yeah exactly you know I'm just a release that you know the steam if you will build up and you had to leave release that vow even sure and sometimes that does help so\nYou know but also parents are paying the mortgage parents are looking to to do shopping experience of all of these in food all these ... these obligations that you have to run and keep the house going on fortunately sometimes\nYou know the kids in the back of the car and asking them how school or what have you you want to hear the answer but you've got you know three minutes before you stop at the gas station or whatever so sometimes they don't feel that they want to talk to you while the sitting in the back of the\nCar right yeah it's got to be a good time for them to talk to you not just when it's convenient for you\nRight exactly which is what I Try to do it if they go up in between errands thereafter\nWhen they kinda know they're smart they are now like okay this is the window I'm getting in and screw him on that\nTalented right they don't they don't say a lot of stuff but uh my wife smart wasn't she'll take some time when she's you know bathing with them and all and things slow down and she's she does it a lot better than I Do is she'll just talk to them and now they're into the\nMode of being at least my nine year old little girl was talking to my wife a lot more about things and it's great and what's going on so yeah I Hope that uh at some point in time I could slow down and\nDo that too is Leo I mean I think I don't know if it works and not as bad with the sun versus mom with a daughter I don't know whatever but I I Try what I can all the time but uh anyway so that's expressed very well\nFeeling better talking it out and you\nKnow I feel worse I feel like honestly I feel like Mr McGregor at this point us\nWhere the apron memory of the apron Andrea it back as you're not seeing\nIf you are if if I read what it what it like if you haven't seen that movie you've got to see that movie\nRight I mean it's it's a it's real but back to it it is trying to think outside the box have some fun do some things uh you know that you haven't done before he even open mind don't make rules about what friends you have in ... and who you're going to hang out with call them all up and what was she shows up shows up to to see the movie in the theater or\nYou know the library or whatever it might be seeing a movie just as a movie black and white by the way it doesn't mean his bad movie\nThe same ... better exactly how it will be back right after this video so again\nSee today is the writer who sees line 'cause we are food for worms last [noise] like you to step

path and I were all given certain cards to play and it's um\nIt's not easy to figure out how to bluff for to to go all in that mix center exactly so that's a it's hard so anyway ah we we took a turn to the serious here and everything will just do it given our\nBack to school and our looked back to school or is there something Mr Cohen that uh you want to do any of these stories that we've we've we've jumped over any of these stories will be one more section left in one minute here no while run on the spot yeah\nPut me on the spot um well I Do I remember I'm\nThinking back now you and I had gone with the whole group of people to see a movie called\nThe warriors remember the warriors I don't know if you remember seeing that movie jackass\nAnd everyone we went way of just love the movie and we spent and I didn't really know you that well time but we sat next to each other we spend a lot of the movie\nJust like looking at each other in laughing at the moving right moves so ridiculous and I knew like okay I like to say I like I my wavelengths right you know and I think that's I don't know why it just hit me now but maybe we were talking about the James Dean movie\nWhen we went to see that but that was the connection that I I remember maybe it wasn't the first one but it was a connection I remember I had with you at the beginning was like oh here's somebody on my wavelength\nI agree and it was ... healthy or what would you say to me it was a a nice to see someone that's able to step\nOut and actually not go along with the crowd but because the crowd says they love this movie\nHe was not a good movie and it was a poor message and I was not into it at all and and I was thinking to myself I'm the only person here and I for so all stand up and you know somebody else will tell them is terrible but it was nice to be able to share it with you to say you know what this is this you know what's going on here and and I'm not\nGoing to we're not going to be that person that\nGoes along with the crowd right is because the crowd says it's good to do something you know so I appreciate that that's exactly what I I I Would basically say the same exact thing a ... at this point that that's important to find some of the general on the same we've linked with as well as you can't force\nFriends you know you really don't you don't have that chemistry exactly

show here to look at the teachers a little more serious than usually do we'll get back to a little more fun certainly but uh the if you have the right teacher that can last for a long time and that's what that message is\nIn a twilight zone episode called changing of the guard with Donald pleasant\nWhich I haven't seen I think is really worth while especially if you're just getting into high school because as a kid going into high school or into college maybe you don't appreciate\nThe classes we've talked a lot about social stuff we talked about being in a band and we talked about those silly antics and so forth being in the class itself as the majority of your time and his while you're there\nNow I don't think it's the only thing in the world we've talked about it obviously\nBut what would you say David we were here with David Corn of course would would you change anything let's first talk about the classes and we could back off until about other things at school but if if you were to do it again would anything changed with respect to either teachers or the classes in general whether it be college high school whatever it might be\nYeah I think that I Would definitely take the the study is more seriously but not that I didn't but I think I Would probably look more into it like do more work on my own and yeah as to teach them all the questions\nDid you take the class is\nA serious enough to pass the test that's the thing but you you you wanted to get the ... in other words you studied to to get the grade as opposed to studying to learn the material correct\nThat makes sense that difference and I do the same thing everybody does not everybody but I remember taking economics in college\nAnd everybody but my roommate and I did absolute ... horrible and it was it was not something that they ... it was a topic that's brand new to children with kids whatever that at Eighteen Nineteen\nIn and it was it was a two semester class as well micro macro and we just eat it up for some reason I really enjoyed it and\nI um got like a hundred and muscle that my buddy we study for it we just love the way it worked\nIt was the way my mind worked and the professor called us and I believe this is freshman year yes it is freshman year ... after I Would say after I guess right before school ended for the for the semester the second semester I guess I'm trying to go to the timeframe unless it was after the first semester anyway cause in\nSpecifically it does it trouble I don't know what the heck he wanted me to change my major to economics why did so well and what a fool that I was that I didn't do that\nBecause it was close hard was it hard for me in that I got the hundred yeah it was a lot of work to get the hundred but\nIt was something that

because most the time travel science and technology\nTo you by theoretical interests popularizer of science and world renowned author\nPresser Meteo ...\nAnd why\nI had to\nCome back to science fantastically professor Michio Kaku\nOn science fantastic every week we profiled some of the most amazing developments in science we're talking about profiling the breakthroughs that are changing the way we view of the universe and also affecting our daily life\nWell on science and tests that we've had Nobel Prize winners directors or major laboratories\nTalking about the creation of the universe out the possibility of time travel anti matter dark matter that cutting edge science but today we're going to take a step in a different direction we're going to talk about the physics of\nEvery day things that is right or wondering like how does that laser work or what about stealth bombers how do they work not to mention how do we know where the moon came from or how do we know how old the dinosaurs were\nThings that we encounter every day\nBut leave us with our heads scratching wondering how do they do that how did he tell you the age of a dinosaur how do they know where the moon came from well with us today as some of those and explained the physics of everyday things the book is called the physics behind dot dot dot\nSenator or as we are going to talk about the physics of everyday life with us today is Russ swan author of the book the physics behind and we got 'em all the way from England\nAnd so once again we're going to be talking about the things that have your head scratching every day how does the touch screen work what is Moore's law how does tells farmers were\nHey how does the touch screen work where does Moore's law hottest else bombers or how do we know where the moon came from how old are the dinosaurs and how do we know these are some of the things we're going to be talking to Mr swan\nAlso like you might want to go to my website to find out what I'm up to my website is am Cochran dot org M.

I'm\n... you know how they appear to move you when you walk around\nYou know about the myth of the off the gold that can be found them to the end of the green do ... ... want to go to the rainbow might be though because nobody's ever been to the end of the rainbow it's impossible to get that we're in an everyday thing but when you were a child\nYou think wow what on earth is happening\nAnd it's an adult we tend to think I Would just ... ... ... ... nothing special about it is kind of special interest like from the from\nBeing reflected through raindrops suspended and the atmosphere and the same effect as if you look at a CD or a DVD ... you get the kind of rainbow shouldn't though the different wavelengths of light all bent backwards to want to find different amount depending on\nOn their wavelength all night long they are really interesting things to talk about a rainbow ... his own down from the song so if you could see your own shadow have to sometimes ... you will head it's always the some of the ... of the rainbow\nAnd for some it was really high in the sky it can be too high for ... for them but when it goes down the remote goes up and you can ... I found that the financial actually she was a few weeks ago\nIs a complete from your circle compete in the sky\nOr because of this practice which we call it forty two degree will but the line from your head to the fight to the rainbow was about forty three\nRight now if you take a look at the origin of Hawaii lied bends when it goes through glass or drop us of water in the air you go all the way back to Isaac Newton\nWas I think a new a new show that white light is actually composed a different colors but the fact that these colors band at different rates inside the glass\nIsn't that due to the fact that different color is travel effectively in glass at different speeds so since the speed of light in glass is not a constant you're going to have different color is traveling a different velocities and that's the reason why why it like Ben into all the colors and the rainbow right\nExactly right of course when I was like ... different reminds become become separated\n'em when they then pulled in July you can feel different colors in different places in this guy was great genius was not just the light into different colors they will see then combined it back into white light which was the the thing that really prove that it was white light\nColors and then re combined back into white [noise]\nAnd by the way even though we don't get into the biology of the colors and she was a human eyeball cannot really see all the colors of the rainbow at all only three colors red green and blue\nAnd it's sort of like an optical illusion that we think we're seeing all the colors of the rainbow in their true form but we're only seeing combinations of three colors right\nAt the same way that the television screen or your computer models that were built up a complete range of millions of covers using the primary comes it's quite quite a clever technique has been developed by nature are and we copied it in our technologies to make the same thing\nAnd and but it's amazing is that some people especially some women and actually see four colors are they having mutation in their eyes [laughter] such that they can see more than just the three primary colors that most people can see it can actually see foreign colors\nShould think it would be interesting to look through somebody else's eyes because it's it's kind of impossible to do that without some or all the gruesome troubled times but I Wonder what that would look like\nTo see more colors than the current loosely\nWell we talked about laser light we talked about rainbows and now let's talk about another form of electromagnetic radiation in the form of well the stealth bomber\nThe self bomber his so called invisible but is it really invisible how does a cell phone camera work and many of the reports of flying saucers are due to the fact that the military secretly tested itself technology for so many decades\nAnd use flying saucers stories as a cover so Russ tell us a little bit about another form of electromagnetic radiation and stealth bombers\nI think the first thing that it's really important to note this is the point that I Do but don't bombers are invisible to radar but they are not invisible to optical light to do good things you can do it in the past you you'd probably get rich but you would also be able to see it on the ... there is a\nNice things to say off actually lives in

a huge through your website I was just wondering\nFacebook sites and the Internet site you can see the books that I've written for New York times best sellers of the latest one is called the future of humanity that future humanity in outer space\nYou know that the dinosaurs dinosaurs did not have a space program\nAnd that's why they're not here today to talk about it we are where the lucky ones because we do have a space program and then the question is is our space program up to speed will it protects us one day when we inevitably face\nA catastrophe like what happened when the dinosaurs got wiped out\nSixty five million years ago when Iraq plowed into Mexico and white top to dinosaurs\nSo give us a\nCall six one to five six for eight one thirty five is the number to call leaves that message by making that question and making that comment and putting it on radio\nWell we had a question before the break and the question is rather advanced so then you try to break it down first of all we do I do for a living my paycheck comes from the city and state of New York 'cause I work on something called string theory shrinks we think it's a theory that eluded Einstein for the last\nYears of his life as theory of everything each vibration of a tiny tiny tiny little string\nCorresponds with some of the timing particle and that's why we have so many subatomic particles so physics is now reduced to the laws of harmony vibrating strings chemistry is the melodies you can write on vibrating strings\nThat unit versus a symphony of strings and then the mine never God\nThe mind of God the looting I signed for the last Thirty years of his life the mind of God because make music resonating too hyper space tend dimensional hackerspace\nNow we live in a three dimensional universe but there could be hidden dimensions out there because if our universe is above all of some sort even children asked the question what is it bubble expanding into\nWell our bubble is expanding into hyper space we think ten dimensional hyper space but the question or asked how come I sometimes say eleven dimensional hackerspace well let me explain\nIntend dimensions we have five string theories that are totally cell consistent and qualify for the theory of everything now we don't like that we think the universe should be unique in some sense\nSo why should the universe create not one but five mathematically self consistent universes that sounds a little strange right well we're in at Princeton\nFound out the reason why if you go to one more dimension up\nInto the eleventh to mention\nAnd then you squeeze it he was squash one of the dimensions when you get you get ten dimensional string theory so think of a beach ball\n[noise] think of these ball and think of the equator some of the baseball and then flattened it out into a pancake\nYou flatten a beach ball so that it loses one dimension and becomes a flat pancake it looks like the equator that is a string\n[laughter] so in other words a string is a collapsed beach ball a collapse membrane\nSo then the question is if I live in in Lebanon national average space and I have a membrane or baseball how many ways can you squeeze it\nWell you got to talk to them as a petition for that but the answer is five ways there are five ways you can squeezed a beach ball so that it becomes the equator that is a string well bingo why do we have five string theories intend dimensions\nBecause they really are the same thing\nThis blue the minds of the world's physicists\nThe same thing this blue the minds of the world's physicists\nRealizing that the five string theory is that we work with for Thirty years is actually one object an eleven dimensional membrane of some sort I like to think of it is an elephant\nThink of an elephant if you were to analyze the trunk of an elephant in the trunk looks like a two dimensional object if you look at\nThe ears of the elephant you say it looks like a fan you put it all together and you get a very strange object many ways to create an elephant by looking at the feet\nThe trunk the nose so you would say that there really are five different animals one animal looks like a tree that is the seat when animals like snake that is they're not as one animal looks like a fan that is a year but what is it\nIs it five different objects no one is an elephant\nSo in the same way we think ten and eleven dimensions\nThere is one object that when you slice it up gives you five different strings Harry's and so to make a long story short this dazzled the world of physics realizing that may be the universe is unique\nMaybe there is one and only one way to create a universe that satisfies all the criteria that we need to create a unified field theory [noise]\nWell there are also had another question about four dimensional bubbles on a person that we didn't get a chance to listen to all of that but let me explain really briefly what he\nWas getting at why does the universe expand the universe expands because there's something called dark energy pushing the galaxies apart\nSo even nothingness has energy dark energy and pushing the galaxy apart and the question is can string theory explain this well yes and no\nIt turns out that if you simply calculate one way he wished to derive the four dimensional universe from string theory there are many ways to do it\nIn one way you can get our universe but to be fair there are other ways of reducing the eleven dimensional theory down to four dimensions so there is more than one universe\nThis is called the multi of hers theory and it means and in some sense string theory cannot yet\nCalculate exactly the amount of dark energy in the universe unless you put it in by hand and we don't like that so in other words string theory is not finished yet it's not in his finished mathematical form and if you weren't listening to the show\nPerhaps one day you you may have that inside to allow us to complete the theory and calculate exactly the amount of dark energy in the universe maybe somebody doesn't send you that show will one day figure out the theory of everything\n[laughter] okay well let's move right onto the next listener phone call\nKaren I'm calling us stiff 'em call or two times as much as I Know what to talk to you know perpendicular to each other possible costs like three or four times mattress or insurance firm actions\nOr her on the other kinds of white on on the ah The Cosby on stage or on more space time here talk\nWell at first that question sounds weird preposterous and stupid actually [laughter] it's a subject of intense debate among theoretical physicists\nSay string theory which is the leading theory for the theory of

judiciary deal EL because friday is and you know friday this Friday it means that okay so we move forward\nBecause there's going to be of a vote there's going to be a vote\nOn um on Kavanaugh and we\nKeep hearing about these swing senators and what does that mean ultimately it is the talk of not just DC but the country so here we are putting a I'm a foot\nIn the sand again on the Kavanaugh sandbox debate as to what happened and to me that now it's so intriguing and I said the last couple of days that I thought it was going to be you know I think the forty\nThat he gets confirmed based on my conversations with people I Know in Washington DC who are connected who are constantly on the hill who are and who are aids or who know aids or who are um prepping\nSenators and all that kind of stuff to really these sources but even the sources are not really sure\nBecause they see a step back a step forward at this point that I think the steps forward so I'm I think it's Seventy five percent that he gets confirmed Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is advancing the nomination Supreme Court he did that\nBy insisting that they're going to get the results of the FBI supplemental background investigation it's going to be finished then of course there was a secret secret room in the capital and the senators got to go and look at what was in that report\nAnd the um without having made public\nBut but the deal is they expect some of it to leak in certain areas where there was an evidence of assault those who have seen it say there's not enough there there's not enough to to say that\nIn this report it doesn't corroborate some of what was being said forty six page report\nOn allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominees have enough we know that right\nTo the FBI background investigation was like a compromise after that testimony from I'm Christine Ford and Kavanaugh about whether he attacked her during their high school years Nineteen eighty two at a party\nAnd in exchange for a vote to move Kavanaugh's confirmation to the full Senate Senator Jeff Flake was granted to his request for an FBI investigation into charges by four to one of Kavanaugh's

America Tonight let's head right to a Washington DC Ellen rather from talk media news\nEllen your take on um what from what happened with Trump the other day and then have the White House response to it\nAt first of all the White House has responded standard way and actually Iraq the Sanders had a press briefing today which is like the first one and twenty something today\nBut of course she had people coming in and she had to have a great thing but um I take it that they basically responded and the only way that they could act at the front and that sort of went off the rails\nResponded and the only way that they could after the president is sort of went off the rails last night\nYeah I yeah exactly 'cause what is she going to say to that and and now they're talking about cloture vote what happens where we go all the\nCloture vote is the votes bat is made to cut off debate and\nDo that instead of continuing debate debate whether he should be whether she people's lives and it took us to him or not or whether he was lying at cetera they will vote on friday to cut off the debate and then they will have the effect of the actual vote either on Saturday or Sunday\nWow crazy I said well all of that's going on of course there's some other things as well that are um erupting if you will including a volcano that is a a reflected in a ... and the Indonesian island that is just I don't know if you've seen some of the video but it's just terrible\nI thought and believable yes I mean but just as there on the ring of fire right so that's what happened sadly when something pops their these two nominees are triggered they're saying fourteen hundred people love a killed\n[laughter] well that's right and the numbers are going up because people are not able to get the medical help that they make yeah wow ... so they made their numbers are probably ah you know go up even more\nYeah and then of course the other thing is the the New York times investigation the president's tweet today about the New York times and this has to do with the taxes you know you spent time in New York and I'll tell you what I think they're going to be there rapidly going to go after any money they think they're oh don't you\nWhile they were because they're going to go after New York state is going to go after any money than it is I think that's it you know what they think that they owe it however there is a statute of limitations the question is which of the things to New York times outlined about Donald Trump are within the statute of limitations sandwich or not\nYeah they're crazy um and then back to the cabinet I think NBC reporting to the FBI hasn't contacted people with information on Kavanaugh's that\nThis is what's happened to many people and who have said that they have information I'm Kevin ... that they can either back up something or not back up something there's something like forty people have said that the FBI has not even gotten back to them even after they've offered to speak to the FBI\nSaid he would split into Thursday and you know that's going to slip into Thursday and centers that have to share it and go copy which we kept in a secure facility behind closed doors it is a single copy and one by one for senators walked in and signed in like it's a library\nAnd read what they read at the FBI report seems kind of crazy ... because I think they're afraid of the whole leak thing I guess\nEspecially ... and none of this coming out a senator Amy club which are the Democrat from Minnesota who's a member of the Judiciary Committee who opposes Kavanaugh said McConnell filed closure even US Senators haven't seen the FBI report hadn't seen that that it was\nWhy I'm a you know and then you had a lot of reaction to wow can we do this without seeing this so maybe you know it's kind of in that phase of like I said my mind goes to the saw one minute it looks like OK boom and this is going to go\nAnd then the next minute it swings back into\nYou know the other direction and this is nothing new with what we see here in the United states because it's team then so with very polarized and of course politically speaking and then with midterms coming up and and here's the thing to me look get the best person on the bench period whoever the best person is\nLet's get that best person on the bench because that's a lifetime appointment and it is an incredible on earth can be tapped the egg to be picked for that\nIt's something on it for getting paid for something that nobody listening to this show because I guarantee none of the Supreme just listening to America than I doubt it so I'm\nYou know what would that be like to be\nOn the bench and the highest court in Atlanta I mean that is an incredible honor to to to do that to be pegged as somebody who gets confirmed goes through and then has the ultimate say is part of that process\nUh to me that something's really sacred I Hope we don't trample on all of that really honestly I Hope not\nSo the Republican save the Republicans are of safeguarding the FBI report\nAnd one by one I guess people are filing in and they're going to read it and however long that takes a while to actually if you think about it what is really wild and really sad and more than wild\n[laughter] very very sickening I think is what happened with these officers six officers were hurt one killed in the south Carolina's shooting\nYou know I've heard this before because I have family members who are police officers that domestic violence that's where you can have a debt when you're a cop so\nIs that domestic violence that's where you can end up dead when you're a cop so what happened was that was a two hour standoff and nice residential neighborhood in Florence County South Carolina\nWith a man who had children hostage he fired on the cops from multiple agencies 'cause they were from a couple of different ones the kids were unharmed that's a good thing it started about four o'clock eastern\nWhat happened was the shares the Florence county sheriff's office tried to serve a search warrant at home I'm In a subdivision not far from where the flooding from Hurricane Florence had\nReally ripped up places and then the suspect started shooting they said all you can hear you know shops all over the place\nAnd the where he was positioned his view of fire was several hundred yards and he had an advantage they say and imagined again trying to serve this so I'm the wounded officers were evacuated they were transferred Israel hospital\nAnd the the one that was killed was of\nA thirty year veteran of the police department and it's I mean really John Keller um\nYou know talked about it um the talked about who it was a parent's Carol way they say and I just gosh\nIt just breaks your heart when you hear these stories I mean how difficult it an awful as this and a lot of people were tweeting out about a senator I'm Lindsey Graham said heartbroken God Bless the people who choose to protect us and their families\nA president tweeted out thoughts and prayers are the Orange County sheriff's office and the Florence police department tonight I in South Carolina were grateful for law enforcement\nOfficers\nAnd then here's\nThe reaction and just a little more detail about the officers being shot\n\n'em and more of that reaction is the um governor from South Carolina said this is simply devastating news from Florence to selfless acts of bravery for men and women and law enforcement is real and it's um\nYou know looking at a map of and it really was in the middle of all that devastation that happened with the heavy flooding because of the hurricane and it's a\nIt's a city that's like kind of in the northeast cause I've spent some time now as you well know in South Carolina to like in the northeast corner\nOf the kind of the of South Carolina and it's right where two majors thoroughfares or interstates you know intercept Ninety five and twenty it's a pretty decent size city and I'm here is that reaction more reaction\nWas all for\nTo do random\n[noise] yeah so random search warrant ear not looking for that to happen and this has been in domestic violence\nCases as I've heard from family members this is where is the scariest when they walk into a situation that they don't even know what they're walking into they have absolutely no idea [noise] wow [noise]\nIn the meantime out with a little bit of this and that meaning things that we might miss out on the map up quickly I'll go to a couple of stories that I was looking at earlier in the um earlier in the day and\nOne of them was a this one and it it has to do with the fact that you've got um\nWell I like I have no idea what's going on with these\nAirlines because we keep seeing that none of these things are happening and they're having to to land the plane and when I say that there's kind of a mate there was a mayday call with this Australian flight in it you know the horror was\n... I mean what's going on because they just hear this mayday mayday just really creepy but the United a flight ended up\nLanding thank goodness and ... it's a it landed safely in in Sydney after the hysteria over that it was seven eighty seven Dreamliner from Los Angeles and they have low\nFuel low fuel oh my gosh really oh that's awful so what do you do when you have low fuel while you do a mayday\nBecause what's gonna happen if you can't get there it's going to it's going to trigger\nResponses to All right if you've got low fuel where can we possibly get you down and it was looking like\nThat's what was going to have to happen they were going to have to figure out a place where they could jump the flight and um it did it did land and then there was some kind of weird mechanical issue but they got to the gate the customers got off\nAnd ... are you at a hundred and eighty passengers fourteen crew and it was a a few things that there's an international standard that requires when you get down to your fuel reserve you have to declare a fuel May Day you have to do that\nIn case you can't make\nDown my God\nEven close roads around the airport [noise] my on my\nWay to go to

that and now it's the gloves are often anyone's fair game basically okay so um\nWhat's the mood to go\nTo this one this one comes to us from Levi boy a lot of new people and that's terrific though if you ever want to share your thoughts you can jam on the ditches eight five five I don't say the number and I was I guess eight five five to six six fifty two eighty three eighty five five to six sixty to eighty three or go to Kate\nDelaney radio dot com and let me know how you feel about what's happening in the world around you as I say\nWhat I'm going on in my backyard and buzzing is probably bussing in yours to the bombshell report that came out on Donald Trump's\nTaxes on his release father Fred Trump they're saying now that his father funneled at least four hundred and Thirteen million basically the equivalent to his sons and they're saying including instances of outright\nFraud so\nThe times sound and and the report in the way at least a hundred and forty million for sure like where it was tied\n'em there's the in the report they had a whole bunch of ways that this was being buried and now New York's department of taxation is vigorously pursuing this so when you look at this\nDo you think\nThat I'm just put the presidency in peril or do you think that um it could be just a matter of he's going to pay a ton of money back\nWell I think if there's this fraud and the New York tax board goes after it and they can uncover the way it's being funneled then they could charge interest and all of that on top of it and I think um yeah it would be a money thing it couldn't be criminal thing\nBecause the statute of limitations I've said this on another show would be up on that but um\nIt could be that is the money thing that the ... they'd have to pay\nThe taxes whatever tobacco taxes were and if they go way back I think about the interest with that interest\nI guess look like would it look like\nI mean I think it would be a ton of money from what they're saying so somebody said to me today we'll just give up a building right [laughter] do you sell a building\nUp will have no idea [laughter] I Do know that they will absolutely they will ... the attacks were absolutely go after anyone for whatever they back they will uncover whatever they have to uncover means really honestly\nI then I got this one from Tom who says I'm Kate did you know I Know there's a

sign up for his daily free email newsletter\nAnd just to mention that my co host and colleague Lisa Abramowitz is off today staples and where do you want to begin there's G. E. there's the sale of a billion dollars worth of energy assets there this is the first deal that we've heard from\nWith a new CEO at GE Larry Cole also and go to buy a row and two point four billion dollars consolidating the oil rig business\nWell the ants go Rowan deal seems interesting because ... the reaction was negative and even when you look before the opening bell\nHe saw boats stocks were down in this and all share deals so you can sort of understand the reaction to some extent now you're looking and you see in the ... the ...\nWar with higher up ... percent as co chairs of four percent\nThat's right and wrong ends up three percent as well so you have both the uh sooner and the target moving higher which doesn't happen all the time with the ... so I mean if you look back over the last couple of years uh you've seen it happen to some extent\nAnd this may have to do with the projections that er\nAnd ... giving about where the businesses headed to me and they're talking about the the ... purchase adding to cash well starting at twenty twenty they're looking at a hundred and fifty million dollars in annual cost savings and those are the sort of things that investors want to hear when these kinds of deals come up so\nA a more positive reaction at this point than uh the transaction initially got\nAnd also just the can we do a little on General Electric and GE just because the shares up a little bit more than one percent but big volume on GE over thirty four million shares traded\nYeah that's typically been the case though for GE especially lately with the stock falling into a nine year old low\nAnd then bouncing back with or shall we say of vengeance last week in response to the hiring of Larry Cole first outsider to run a G in its history I mean talking about stock the rose almost Seventeen percent\nLast week and it's moving up a bit again today response to this deal a so perhaps some optimism that a cult is going to get things straightened out at this company\nI Wonder whether we're going to get in those Thirteen filings but we won't get the mental after the new year for the fourth quarter which is where you would perhaps see some of the purchases of G. E. stock show up and it'll be interesting to see who has purchase shares of G.

underestimate what companies deliver\n... you never under delivered thanks very much Dave Wilson Bloomberg stocks common Sunday even email de Wilson at Bloomberg dot net now let's go to or not in our studios to go to Nancy lines for world a national headlines dancing\nSure thank them for having me on and and uh it's a it's a good question um [noise] we you know are are sort of hunt for good companies begins by I'm thinking about a new market opportunities for technology whether it's\nA sequencing DNA sequencing technologies are diagnostic technologies are in the case as you mentioned technologies that that create new medicines for patients um that don't have good option\nI'm so begins there and and we we ... ourselves in the dynamics of of the markets try to understand what it means to to uh be a good company what the technologies you need\nAnd at the end of the day or what we've learned is the biggest determinant of success or the people and so once we find all those factors um and we find a great group of people behind the company will invest\nAnd occasionally that that company that we go down to fight is private and so we've created in the partnership flexibility to invest in private companies um I I Will say we we hope never to do it and so we really want to be investing in public companies but in the life of the fund we've done at about fifty times\nOkay uh the reason I asked that question is the kind of set us off on this path to explore some of the more recent trends in health care and biotechnology and I'm Wondering if you could speak about all of the research the oncology cancer research that is going on\nAnd we're you know the industry right now\nI mean ... is a it's just an amazing time in a life science broadly\n'em and cancer specifically um cancer or is it molecular disease by definition meaning there were some error in the DNA in different ways allows cells to grow out of control resulting in in\nA a damaged other organs and dysfunction and so for the last thirty five forty years we've been trying to understand that ah the technologies have improved\nAnd are increasingly were able to ah create drugs that that fight it I'm sure the company's you you mentioned there strategies actually art to stimulate the immune system to do its job which is generally is\nFighting cancer and all of us but in in some people it it um the cancer\nIs able to evade or trick the immune system and so we can't do its job is to the companies you mentioned grits stone and me on\nUm are both trying to develop a personalized immunotherapy solutions to to fight cancer um others like magenta recognize that um [noise] having sort of bone marrow transplants can really a re boots sort of\nA faulty immune systems are in the in the case you described in cancer um and so uh well those are very effective um the treatments that conditioning to to make room for these new a bone marrow transplants can be very toxic and and limit the uh application and many patients so they're trying to make it easier\nFor patients to receive all a curative bone marrow transplant\nTell us a little bit more about gene editing technology and how that is attracting either your attention or how people can follow it in a in a specific way yeah\nI think I think one way to think about this whole field is that\nYou know I'm a it's all in engineering challenge that the human body is that the the the most complex machine a we know\nAnd for a long time we could not figure out how to understand it let alone tinker with it\nUm we are getting better and better at understanding and then there are now tools um to tinker with gene editing being one where this era that we identify and the molecular code that causes in the case of cancer cells throughout I can control\nWe now have tools to go in and start to rewrite that a\nA broken code and make it you know incorrect it so that the cells are are are functioning properly\nThat's you know that the ideal it's still very very complex to do and um some companies have developed new technologies that are that have the potential to allow you to do that um it's still early and still very hard uh but it's a we're getting much\nHum it's still early and still very hard but it's a we're getting much better\nAt it give you thirty seconds what is the biggest mistake you find when you meet non expert investors in biotechnology\nIt's very simple or at the end of the day it's management management management and so people invest in technologies but forget that very few are molecules jumped off the medical bench and ended up in your\nMedicine cabinet on their own there's thousands of decisions made by hundreds of people and you should always be investing and the people\nWell ... thanks

it's not all of what I Am and I think that that's very important distinction I'm an educator I'm an organizer and I believe that what what we're really just a movement for health care housing and education and the United states\nJoining us and the Bloomberg interactive brokers studio is Claire Valentine Bloomberg News finance reporter Claire you've written a story about a new generation in finance that has embraced progressive politics Wall Street's new left tell us about it yeah\nSo a lot of these kids are just coming out of college a lot of lives through the economic crisis I'm and I'm very open to this new way um obscene things and um they're not seen candidates and the ... the Republican Party address the\nConcerns that they happened to their increasingly turning towards his Democratic candidates\n... you're not writing off economic conservatism on Wall street or you\nKnow definitely not and I think there's still a very strong contingent on especially and the older sad but increasingly more than we've seen before I think is younger people are coming in and bringing these values and it's become more accepted um for them to talk about it in the workplace and they go out on the weekends and organize for it\nSo you write that the top issues for millennials on Wall street or climate change inequality in health care how does\nFit in with the profit\nMotivation of Wall Street right and I I think it's a very competing values in a sense um and I think younger people when they're just coming and they're not making tons of money um and so there you know they've seen their parents struggled to that kind of crisis they've\nSeen their friends or themselves struggling student loan debt 'em and they're just focus on these things I'm as well as their greater ambitions on Wall street and a lot a lot of working in tech jobs too is it's not your traditional banking jobs always\nThey'll correct me if I'm wrong but that dumped a Republican still run ahead of Democrats in terms of political contributions from Wall street I\nBelieve so um and I think that you know part of that could be because these younger people are just starting out they're not making enough money to really contribute and eventually they will and um there are some experts that I talked with the article who said you know these kids might\nBe embracing these progressive views now but wait until they get older and then see what happens\nIf you also write about how banks and investment firms are actually competing with Silicon Valley for some of these millennials and so that changes the diversity of the workforce\n[noise] definitely and I think Wall Street's on has become more tech focused on and they're having to recruit these younger people [noise] um and if they want to compete with Silicon Valley which has a lot of perks they're um they have to be open to letting these young people express their political views and support whatever party they they want\nIs their debate on who has the ...\nSo the conservatives or the the the more liberal thinking um\nI think it depends on who you ask really um and I I think you know there's this cohort of younger people um\nBut who knows what'll happen in the future and um you know especially when they administration changes a lot of people um we're just really anti Trump um so so who knows after Trump's on golf that's what will happen\nWhat about that Republican tax plan did it affect any of the people that you're talking about any of the millennials yeah\nSo the thing that is that most of them I'm probably aren't making enough for that\nLen eels yeah so the thing with that is that most of them I'm probably aren't making enough for that to significantly unpack them and to change their mind set 'em a lot of these younger people are more interested in things like a quality health care for all than they are and you know tax cut themselves I think\nIs is this the the Wall Street protests that we saw after the ... the milk them I'm sort of coming home to roost now that uh maybe there is a little bit of blowback\nI think maybe and and we'll see you know just with all these younger people coming in you know you never really know what's what's going to happen um and how their viewpoints or just in the new life into the industry\nIt's ... it's a really interesting article in saying that I haven't thought about before so congrats to you for getting it altogether Oh thank you\nAnd thanks so much clearer that Claire Valentine she's a Bloomberg News finance reporter\nComing up on politics policy power and law we're going to talk more about Brett Kavanaugh he is going to join the Supreme Court he'll be the youngest member on the bench as far as tenure and we'll talk about what that means\nAnd how he could shape the court for years to come but first let's check on the latest world a national headlines with Bloomberg Nancy ... thanks June New York governor Andrew\nCuomo says prestige limousine has a lot to answer for after the weekend crash that killed twenty people he says the limo failed state inspection last month and should not have even been on the road Barbara Douglas has the answer to four sisters killed and the crash and says safety was their top concern they did the response\nSome breaking news Google says they're shutting down Google Plus for consumers on blonde school shares are down to ... percent on the news that it's shutting down Google Plus for consumers\nJonathan though he was very influential in the cases that came to the court might the court step back a little bit from taking cases that are going to end up like Lena five four split for a while in order to try to repair the damage that's been done to its image\n[noise] well I think certainly the chief justice as we know like to keep the court out of high profile political dispute when he can I think also whenever you have a new justice take some time before the justices get a good sense of\nHow the new justice is going to evaluate cases and and I think that\nIt always tend to make the court a little more reluctant\nTo take new cases and I I think that the political fight over Kavanaugh's nomination and the wounds that that it created a will only magnify that normal tendency to move a little slowly when you have a a changes in the court personnel\nWe were speaking earlier in the program about President Obama's attorney general Eric Holder or questioning the legitimacy of the court given all that's happened leading up to this does the court need to tread lightly to regain the country's trust\n[noise] well I think if the court just stick to what it normally does\nThat over time people will will realize that the court is going to continue to divide the sorts of cases it has always decided most of what the court does\nIt is not the sort of thing that makes the front page in New York Times most of what it does provide clarity inconsistency to various aspects of federal law about rules that that relate to the regulation of business the handling of various types of litigation and so on and that\nThat that sort of work is going to continue and I think people will reassure folks at the court is still\nVery much are the type of court that we've we've come to\nClarence Thomas set in his memoirs than it used to wear a bullet proof vest and those days are behind him but\nBrett Kavanaugh in his confirmation was even more contentious and he went outside the typical role of the Supreme Court nominee in several ways with the Fox TV interview the wall Street Journal editorial so might be more difficult for him to overcome any preconceptions the public has\nWell it's certainly understandable that that some portion of the public is going to be skeptical of justice Kavanaugh for some time\nAnd he certainly should be aware of that and in terms of thinking about public appearances and like what sorts of speeches he gives a I think it would make sense for him to be aware of that but at least part time he's going to remain a divisive figure I Would think and certainly hope that he at some point in the near future\nTake an opportunity to acknowledge and reflect on the nomination process and acknowledge his own part particularly at that one hearing in in feeding the the rancor and the partisanship of this process\nCan you give us a little color on what is likely to be like the first time that a Kevin uh takes his place a Supreme Court\nWell he'll be he he will be on the bench tomorrow I Believe when the court hears oral argument and and um you know I think you know he'll be at the end of the the justices sit in order senior already with the cheapest at in the middle and an alternating on either side so he will be up for the far end of the court [noise] um\nAnd alternating on either side so he'll be at a for the far end of the court [noise] um I don't think the justices are going to treat them any differently um for the justices in addition to achieve a were at his swearing in on Saturday including Justice Kagan and Ginsburg\nUm but uh I Do think there will be quite a bit of attention the first time he asked a question I think a lot of us are wondering whether he will be as aggressive\nAt oral argument as justice Gorsuch was during his first term\n[laughter] and I'm coming up is going to be in the court considering overturning the separate ... doctrine where am I his his uh inclinations lie and that kind of case\nI think that that's a particularly hard case the judge for for a bunch of reasons one of which is um wall and the DC circuit he dealt a lot with questions of federal regulation he didn't deal nearly so much with Carter portions of criminal law\nOr with issues of federalism because ... she's not a state sort of federalism concerns that come up for example this dual sovereignty case relating to double jeopardy I didn't really emerged so from those sorts of issues I think we really have a hard time thinking only speculate about how he might approach them\nWould you say the roads cases coming up on sexual orientation and gender identity would be some of the most closely watched just to head\nOff certainly on the court start to take some of those cases I think those would be very closely watched there are some cases relating to affirmative action related to abortion that are working their way up in the lower courts\nUm there are some very important regulatory cases relating to a climate change regulation or two of the FCC's regulation that that also worth watching if they make a court\nThanks to Jonathan Adler professor at Case Western Reserve University school of law and director of the center\nFor business law and regulation\nComing up on politics policy Paul in la

E. N. P. E. private equity worn I'm looking at Goldman actually signaling some caution around their markets platform that's a story that really\nCaught my attention uh and as you said a few minutes ago Wall Street's new left we can't get too far away from politics because the millennial generation\nThey are pretty engaged when it comes to politics and tried to square that with their a capitalist tendencies\nCapitalist by day socialist by night I let's bring in the gang because they are both market lectures I think a morning at day and night\nWe're talking about ... our markets editor here at Bloomberg News kind of said would you miss coming up at four pm last time I Bloomberg ... than our stocks editor apple Lindbergh news both of them are Bloomberg interact and broke her studio here in New York state let me start with you what kind of selling how broad based as they just give us kind of quick rundown here\nWell let me mention technology stocks of leading the way down new one area that gets my attention particular or the payment networks whether we're talking about\nThese or MasterCard pay power square stocks are all taking hit so it's hard to kind of get a sense of what's going on specifically with that area but it's consistent with the it was sort of a broader week this we're seeing as barren mind\nYou know these companies visa and MasterCard at least considered part of the technology group by us and peace and that's how they sort of\nSit in a what's interesting too is if you look at what's up in the market I mean you got financial so little bit higher which need probably figuring based on what's been going on lately with bond yields of course we know the market's closed today for Columbus Day but nonetheless we did see those higher yields then last week\nAnd this is the ... for the moment because there's nothing to move them around them that\nThe rest of the areas are all rate sensitive so it's like people kinda figured that maybe this is as bad as it gets real estate\nUtilities also the makers of consumers say they'll swoop beverage tobacco so it's interesting on a day where are you seeing this broader weakness to have this sort of rape scene kick up again\n[laughter] so is that the sentiment on the news today Joe that maybe this is as bad as it gets how how worried are folks would this leg down\nI don't know I don't think the news is has a marketing view I address and\nThey even here today about half of them are the ones that don't have kids who are on a federal area I think\nIt's really interesting ... says points out with the payment companies particular visa and MasterCard one of the guests that we have on TV a lot of Peter ... of the blog group\nShe always points to the stocks and says as long as they're performing well you can't be too negative on the market is his view so even when he's bearish on other stuff because these are great consumer proxies they're everywhere and as long as those talks are holding up\nA he's optimistic and it really is interesting to see looking at visa breakdown falling below us fifty they moving average getting close to its hundred day moving average yeah really the weakest it's been in a long time to live down into like yeah and so this is an interesting this is an interesting on a it's an interesting area to walk\nAbout ... percent last week yeah continuing see them as um okay so let's see expectations kind of earnings on friday Dave and ... a day what are we looking for in terms of numbers [laughter]\nHow many people anticipating something approaching twenty percent earnings growth for the third quarter ... five hundred least that's what we get the based on a date or the we've compiled under the vigil companies\nAnd you know when you figure that we had twenty four percent roughly in the first and second quarters still pretty respectable and it shows you that the effects of the tax cut from the and the last year\nReally haven't come dissipated all that much and you know you figure that with an analyst tending to shall we say under play the earnings companies to put it another way companies tending to beat projections as a rule something like two birds or so doing that\nYou may well be back at the growth rates that we saw in the first or second quarter as revenues doing just fine to something like eight percent\n[noise] and so what else he worried about Joe\nWell speaking of earnings season there was a good Goldman no they have their weekly kick start note and of course are earning you're supposed to be pretty good this quarter but the big picture is they're saying you know look at the big winners that we all know is coming\nLook at what the impact from higher wages is going to look at the impact from trade and look at the impact from higher rate so from Goldman's perspective the key things to look at during this earnings season\nIs what is the management say on the conference calls about those three topics and I really do think that's going to set the tone or if it looks like companies can pass on higher wages and they're not feeling the bite from some of this stuff yet then that might do a lot to bolster markets sentiment\nCan I just said just pulled up a video link back to the studio and I'm just looking at my my sat empty chair there and you guys look like you're having fun\nBeautiful thank you [laughter] you ever look like you're in a black box I Am in a bind I'm all alone\nI'm All right I think we're going to leave it there guys they can't sell my sterilize ends up markets that are of Bloomberg News cast of vitamins checking out on Bloomberg TV coming your way for pm all the time and Davis is going to be back with his stock in charge of the day of it later on his desk tucked that Bloomberg News does in our Bloomberg interactive gorgeous Bloomberg interactive broker studio according to Jason Kelly\nNo it really is I mean I'm seeing like all I never see it from this from this prospect ... sitting in the fish bowl I'm looking like out of the fish will there's day walking by love it this is great\nAre so funny like a kid out of it is kind of interesting here it is kind of a little bit of a day and we'll see how the rest of the week picks up let's get to the moon markets fight of the day what number that tells us a lot to ... days numbered Jason Kelly is one billion dollars nice round number you know what that says\nLove this this is Nike's bill Knight donated almost one billion dollars of Nike stock\nNike's Phil Knight donated almost one billion dollars of Nike stock\nTo a charitable organization or just in the past few days the latest donation\nWhat nine hundred and Ninety million when it was made a last Wednesday represents about point seven percent of the company's outstanding chairs and three point one percent of his thirty two billion dollar fortune that's according to the Bloomberg billionaires index which of course rank the world's richest folks are\nStill night is a fascinating fascinating character his ah his autobiography is a must read I think we've talked about it for\nAll right good staff hey everybody let's get a check on your latest while the national headlines have about ... go in our living in New York City Hi, Bob\nHas been trying and gee and it's G capital which is it's former financing arm has been trying to have them yeah usually he met\nHas been trying to shed a bunch of its investments to try to get that company back on track\nWhat does it say to a private equity interest I mean have they been as adjust Apollo is that other folks that have been kind of dabbling more and more into energy into the energy face Weaver\nPointed out late that Blackstone and Carlyle or certainly dipping their toes more or pushing more into energy as well Carlisle announced last month and it was buying its first set of wind farms in New York actually and then Carlisle is raising its third energy finally believe on targeting four point five billion for that\nWell and the other element here pegs of course is that private equity loves things that other people don't want I mean and you know we've seen this over the course of you know two or three decades now where\nThese guys are willing to step and eager even to step in to pick off these sort of orphan assets in some cases because you know whether it's just through financial engineering just buying low in selling high or actually doing something with it there seems to be a lot of opportunity there and Apollo is well known for that\nThat's right and I think it's interesting too with energy Apollo has a natural resources finding also invest in ... in energy through its other private equity funds energy has is something that private equity loves which is it's bits off income and a lot of cases getting dividends of swords\nSame reason why private equity investors really love real estate they have some type of an income stream even though the investment they may hold for four or five eight ten years\nIt's interesting too that I was thinking about all the assets right Jason that she has to shed a and we know that this was fun or his plan and now it's being I think sped up under the new CEO but you've had healthcare you've got oil assets I mean what private equity typically dabble into something like Baker Hughes which is a huge huge would be a huge huge by out\nYou know I'm not sure Carol I Do think it's interesting as you said that in some ways people are thinking that he needs to come back to its core roots\nOf of what it what it was a manufacturing company and sort of industrial companies start so as Jason said that puts people in the position to pick off a lot of its other assets in private equity is positioned to do that yeah\nI got to think that private I could have guys are crawling all over this all over GE right now in calling up bankers maybe calling up cult themselves and keep in mind Larry ... the new CEO was working as a senior advisor to Bain Capital before he took this job this was between his two\nCEO jobs also if you look at some of the ranks of private equity especially for like ... billion rights one of the oldest private equity firms Jack Welch the fabled former CEO of GE he's a senior advisor there they have a couple of other people\nWho come through a GED world this is right for the picking\nI think it's also interesting that infrastructure is in play as well so a lot of these ... are really looking at ... infrastructure and what they made me think of when you're talking gays and is that\nFor a lot of people they thought infrastructure was going to be the play of the last couple of years when Donald Trump ... to the vet honesty and said I'm going to unlock a trillion dollars into infrastructure and\nThat hasn't really happened so now you're seeing some of these private equity firms come in and invest in infrastructure energy infrastructure because the as as you said there's there's less of the of the opportunity than ... a lot of people thought\nThere would be well and Carol infrastructure has been elusive you know for the reasons that\nUh that Peggy just outlined from a public perspective but also\nPrivate equity has had a hard time you know K. K. R. Blackstone they've all had some fits and starts when it comes to infrastructure they've yet to find sort of that magic way to get into it you know ... I was thinking about this actually coming over to London because one of the most successful infrastructure deals in the private side\nGlobal infrastructure partners uh own still get weaker port I Believe and they bought and sold London City airport here\nMade a phenomenal profit and there's money to be made but the ... they just haven't been able to pull it off in the way that I think a lot of people expected there what\nI think in part to it because the public private funds have income together right on many people infrastructure was supposed to be a public private partnership where the public puts up some of the money and gives you some guarantee er floor in terms of your your investment and that just hasn't come to\nSome of the money and gives you some guarantee er floor in terms of the year and that's and that just hasn't come to fruition so it makes it a riskier bat\nBut we've talked with you write about just always find that all the money going in and yet they have new projects to invest it yes that's right and and around the world to they can't projects and like you said Jason evenly on black who heads Apollo has said recently you know when people think of infrastructure they're often thinking of roads\nBut we think of an even bigger than that at the airports but it takes a lot of money to rebuild an airport like our lovely LaGuardia and\nThat are getting better\nWith interesting as I Do think you know because as you said Jason that the private equity guys like those kind of out of favor areas and I think here you have a GE he's got to shed their assets they've got to get it down this is what shareholders expects do it quickly\nAnd here's an opportunity whether it's health care whether it's oil whether it's infrastructure to kind of pick up some properties perhaps at a discount so she'll say they love it\nTake a call and happy Monday thanks um I think the most in the bucks investing team leader at ... here at Bloomberg News enter Bloomberg interactive brokers studio I'm Carol Nasser along with like a ... and this is\nMy number two does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for police\nAnything close to the restaurant middle seat with the stomach problem\nMy fear of flying\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with the digestive condition called ... pancreatic insufficient city or a PR even if you don't know when he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nLoading stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy PI because not everybody experiences E. pi on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about all your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable soup don't keep a lid on it go to identify E.
