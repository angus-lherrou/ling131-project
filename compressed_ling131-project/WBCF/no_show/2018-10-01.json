best thing that happened to me in high school really do I mean a lot of guy friends but I had an unusual man who girlfriend so it was it was because of the different perspective and I think it helped

science but today we're going to bring on with us a Christian Davenport staff writer with the Washington Post and his new book space barons he'd lined must Jeff Bezos and the quest to colonize the cosmos\nSo Christians glad you could be on science fantastic\nOh it's so great to be here thanks for having me\nOkay well first of all when you were a child what do you do in the direction of journalism and why did you write this book the space barons\nWell I was actually sort of dragged into journalism by a friend from my neighborhood in Brooklyn and we were both in college in Maine and me he made me a right for I'm On the college paper and I got a\nA a a a job answering the phone from the sports department of the Washington Post when I was Twenty years old\nUm but you know it's funny I grew up I was born in Nineteen Seventy three so didn't have any memories of the Apollo program in fact my first memory of space and what got me into it was a actually the challenger disaster Nineteen eighty six that was my\nFirst memory of it and uh you know the shuttle program for me just wasn't a big thing I I think for a lot of people who grew up around my era that our our memories of space away it resonated with us with spaces history you know the old grainy black and white\nUh videos of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon but uh you know many many years later here I was a reporter at the Washington Post that I was assigned to a press conference a\nAnd we should also point out that he was a he won the Peabody Award and he was a fine was a back\nThree times a finalist for the people are surprised and he's the author of a previous book as you were to war and back with the ... battalion of the Virginia National Guard\nWell in the last segment we talked about billionaire Ilan must who pioneered the reusable rocket and of course he has his fleet of rocket ships the falcon now but it's talk about another billionaire and that is Jeff Bezos of Amazon dot com\nThe richest man in the world and apparently the owner of the Washington Post and therefore your boss so the question is\nWas Jeff Bezos also inspired by science fiction to create his base sport in Texas\nHe was absolutely he used to spend every summer on his grandfather's ranch in South Texas\nAnd when it went through the entire collection of the local library there which actually was a very extensive\nA connection of science fiction books that had been donated to the library and also I think you know his grandfather was a great influence on him he was one of the first employees that ARPA before was DARPA\nAnd I'm so Jeff you know really grew up as a as a real space fan he grew up watching um Star Trek his uh his dog was named after a star trek character and even to this day one of his\nUh companies is named after a star trek character so that was a you know these are childhood dreams and he says he talks about how he when he was five years old he remembers watching uh the first Apollo eleven or the Apollo eleven a lunar landing and and that really left an imprint on him so yeah he was this is a childhood dream for him\nNow also I understand that he has a vision or Iran must had a vision of creating a multi planet species 'cause practice too dangerous but life on just the earth but ... says he has a vision as well so what is his vision\nAnd his idea is ultimately not just to go to will colonize single planets like Mars but to go to space and just spread out in space he likes to say he's working toward the day where millions of people are living and working in space and the idea\nIs to use space to actually protect the earth that with a population growth that we have here on earth that the demand on energy and resources a work at at some point in the future just going to outgrow the earth or is it just not going to be enough resources to sustain the population um to what he wants to do is to help build\nOr to go out into the stars and I'm ... lift heavy manufacturing off the surface of the earth and do that in space where you can mine asteroids for precious metals you can have you know full twenty four hour uh uh sunlight and solar energy and the idea is that if you stop manufacturing on earth where the resources are limited\nAnd put them do that in space and then bring those resources back down to earth then you help preserve the earth when he's been thinking\nAnd talking about this for a long long time he gave a speech when he was in high school and that when he was the valedictorian of his class and he said that should be preserved as a national park now when he gets the same speech are different versions\nOf the changes that slightly and he says that earth should be zoned residential and light industrial but all the heavy industry would be up in space off the surface of the earth and what he wants to do now is help build the infrastructure to get up there\n[noise] right and he's just not talking hot air he has his own space poured in Texas\nHe's just not talking hot air he has his own space board in Texas and his own fleet of rockets so tell us a little bit about his face boards and the new shepherd and the new Armstrong rocket\nThat's right he's got a lot of land that he owns and in West Texas and he's built his first rocket that new shepherd as you mentioned what's his name for a Alan Shepard the first American in space at the sub orbital vehicle would that mean that would go straight up and come straight down a\nAnd the idea they for many many times and not only it's reusable ... flies straight up and then comes back and land\nIt's done this successfully a number of times now and\nWhat they want to do and that this could come as soon as this year\nBut human beings on board and have a space tourists who would go up launch and the rocket that being a capsule\nAnd they fly a you know get to just pass the the edge of space about a hundred kilometers are so you'd be able to um buckle\nUh your seatbelt and float around the cabin for four or five minutes and then sit back down and uh and come back down and landed in West Texas they're also building at the same time a new rocket that would be capable of getting to orbit named a new Glenn after John Glen the first American who made it to orbit\nAnd that it would be a really significant feet for them that really puts them in the space game and in terms of being able to compete for NASA contracts and Pentagon contract and going up against big players like the United launch alliance or the conglomerate of you I'm a Lockheed Martin and Boeing and of course even space sex so he's a\nYou know taking the time they move a little bit slower a little bit more deliberately but you really can't count them out\nNow some people have said that maybe we're going to have a traffic jam on the moon because on one hand NASA has it's as simple as booster rocket as you pointed out and eat on much cash is south and and it's all can heavy\nAnd now we have Jeff Bezos with perhaps the the new Armstrong rocket three moon rockets two of which are funded by private enterprise three moon rock is capable of going to the moon so what's gonna happen I mean what are your thoughts if you could project a few years into the future [noise]\nWell it's really interesting you know and you wonder you know as as a journalist and author covering this you know is there going to be a market that's going to sustain all this growth there all of these rockets in development right now in the United launch alliance has also building Vulcan rocket a and there are a lot of other small launch vehicles underdeveloped now\nAnd you just sort of wonder is this going to be a sustainable um you know and we had a you know on launch the the Falcon Heavy but it doesn't right now I have a big\nUh manifests the way it's worked course rocket the fact that nine\nDoes to you you wonder is the market going to be sustainable um to pull all of those up there and are we going to have a place to go I mean that's we talk about going to the moon and having a traffic jam there um but are we going to have places in low earth orbit to go as well\nUm you know there's talk of commercializing the international space station and other companies um you know such as a big low airspace building habitats that can go into space\nAnd I think that you know if you have the low earth orbit as a stepping stone to the moon and you have other destinations then it can be sustained and if you have enough\nSatellites that need to go up to sustain those launches but let's not forget it I mean the rockets that just really the transportation I you know in some ways it's a destination that really matters\n[noise] okay well some people point to the reusable rocket that you mentioned um in the same way that the used car market after World War two really opened up a the car as part of American culture because today more used cars are sold then new cars\nAnd so with reusable rocket as you think they could be a new renaissance prices could be dropping by tremendous tremendous leaps and bounds opening up auditors space to to terrorism and for all sorts of other activities\nI Will and yes and in some ways that's already happening I mean we've seen that with space X they go in and offer a price that was far below what companies have traditionally been charging for these launches\nAnd now that they're flying you know they're raising their rockets and re flying them and you know re flying their spacecraft that has the potential to dramatically lower the cost and that sort of a goal from the beginning to lower the cost dramatically make space to much more affordable\nMore accessible and that you were launched then at a much higher cadence and then you're much more efficient and reliable\nAnd you know what the ultimate goal is to make it more like a commercial airline operation that's what SpaceX wants to do that's what a Jeff Bezos Simba lured gym on to do and that's why I think all these companies want to do to make it you know more routine now space it's hard it's risky it's expensive it's dangerous\nAnd if you can you know make it much more efficient and by the order of magnitude then um that really could open up space and then you see some of the uh private economic drivers that you know there's the economic model that justifies that high cadence all coming together I think all of those are bound together\n[noise] and speaking about Mars you mentioned earlier I'm even mosque has his own Mars rocket to be F. R.\nB. for big are for rocket and therefore you know what and used it real I mean he used to be a far really a rocket that is going to get off the gun and take us to Mars because of course NASA\nHas an alternative designed to go to Mars oh what are your thoughts about going to Mars\nWill be of I mean well it's hard to go to Mars and ah you know there'll be a far as you\nKnow it's still in development or he has said it might take short hops next year but you know let's not forget NASA's rocket the at the last of\nShort commercial break but after the break let's talk about Mars and then also based tourism with yet another billionaire so once again you're listening to this based barons author Christian diving boards\nAnd this is science and time Michio Kaku give us a call and perhaps you can get on national radio shows again this is science fantastic number to call to fix when do I think for one reason why [noise]\nWhen the chaos from any one of these drugs are wise as the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency that's why you need your own plan for self reliance\nThat's where my patriots supply comes in four weeks or a Bible food supply for only Ninety nine dollars that includes breakfast lunch and dinners\nOrder online at ... dot com Ninety nine bucks for four weeks of survival food that takes like homemade cooking and land so up to twenty five years from my patriots supply get your kids today at ... dot com free shipping is included prepare it would ... dot com\nNever wonder how bitcoin in theory him were created personal media has hundreds of companies and individuals make their own ... and the reason was watching solutions are making the world more transparent and giving power back to the people's\nPersonal media has opened companies raised tens of millions in the past year alone during a marketing I used to go first to a public school\nWhy don't miss the currency revolution was the first of all media dot com V E R D Ito media dumped Tom\nHi I'm Dr building go M.

today is Christian Davenport staff writer\nWith the Washington Post and author of a new book this space barons Iran must Jeff Bezos than the quest to colonize the cosmos\nWell Christian and where we last left off we were talking about well all these billionaires that are funding a new era in space exploration not waiting for the Washington bureaucrats to catch up\nBut we also have space tourism on the rise Richard Branson of a virgin Atlantic has his own company and his own rocket and of course we have\nA jak base does with his rocket also capable of putting tourists to the very edge of space so what do you think's going to happen to space tourism but not one but two different approaches\nYeah we might get a little competition here you Richard Branson Virgin Galactic already has more than seven hundred people that signed up to fly they charged two hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nA ticket now that the program has been in the works for a you know since really since two thousand four three two thousand five so it's been a little slow going on of course they had a a fatal accident and twenty fourteen during a test flight and actually killed\nUh the the co pilot a but they've been back and flying since then and and recently on their new vehicle a spaceship too\n[noise] I phoned supersonic now twice in a row and could you know put human beings are into a space\nOr by this year I'm Jeff pay some blue origin or are are also a I've been flying that rocket the new shepherd wanting to get people you know everyday people into space they haven't yet announced a what their tickets would cost but I Know they have a lot of interest\nYou know one thing that's interesting is that with blue origin they've got a more traditional rocket where the capsule on top that would just blast off and go into space and the capsule would separate a Virgin Galactic spaceship too is more like a space plane if you will it's tethered to the belly of a\nOf a mother ship and the mother ship goes up to forty thousand feet or so\nSpace plane dropped fires its engines and then shoots up into space so I Know a a Richard Branson is told me that he thought he might have a little bit of an edge where you know get a nice soft landing on a on a runway as opposed to being in a cap on coming down but I think\nThat'd be people who would be interested in going up in both and it's possible way of first flights as soon as this year\nNot let me ask you a very practical question and that is the cost\nA numbers have been floated around saying that space tourism it could cost maybe two hundred thousand two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a pop\nTo go up to the age of space and then to go to the space station twenty million in higher to go orbiting completely around the earth on the international space station which some terrorists have already done in fact we had one of them are on the radio so what are your thoughts about the economics of space tourism\n[noise] I think the goal is to bring down the costs as you mentioned Virgin Galactic now charges two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a ticket\nIt's very expensive they are not too many people are going to be able to afford that through your limit your market size but and this is their goal if they're able to fly lively and safely and efficiently and to do it repeatedly over time I mean on a weekly basis is not a daily basis at multiple flights a month\nThan their goal is to actually dramatically lower the cost\nOf doing that and then also the same let's go into orbit I mean ... blue origin Jeff Bezos have talked about flying a tourist into orbit and um space sacks has also talked about flying tourists a on a trip around the moon but in order for that to become accessible you know for\nThe average person the price is going to have to come down and come down dramatically\nOkay so you think the market could be rather limited right if you um if you have spare change to the tune to it\nIt could be rather limited right if you um\nIf you have spare change to the tune of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars then you too can send somebody up into outer space um well let me ask you a question would you do what would you go into outer space if you're a company would foot the bill and have you rocket to the very edge of space\nAbsolutely although as I always say not on the first flight I Would like some test pilots go first and that doesn't work out the kinks but yes and actually when I met with Richard Branson and with Jeff Bezos\nI had gone to the national archives at NASA and they had a journalist in space program during the shuttle which was actually cancelled after the challenger\nDisaster but I went back and got the application for the journalists and space program and and said you know frankly if you want to send if you want to make space accessible to people if you want to democratize space you need to have\nJournalists an independent researchers go up and experience that and write about it and uh I'm Bob Smith a CEO of blue origin told me he said the that's the whole point of the thing is to open up space to the masses you know we want journalists he said we want ballet dancers which I thought was kind of interesting that if you can imagine that and and all sorts of ordinary people\nOkay well again there are people who really want to go to the very edge of space and then they have the money to do it\nWell let's take another short commercial break once again you are listening to science fantastic with professor Michio Kaku is the special guest today is Christian dapper imported the Washington Post and the book is called the space barons even must Jeff ... dos and the question to colonize the cosmos and\nGive us a call that six went to five six for eight months three five\nAnd maybe you can get on science fantastic\n\nWell thanks for the big bubble as we got a mess used cars what do you do for you know we're looking for things you well here's a

humanity\nBut once again this hour is your hour and\nWe're going to start off by reading some of the emails that I get\nSo today we're going to talk about dinosaurs are we going to talk about cancer DNA we're going to talk about ... out of space time travel and these are just some of the questions that I get on email and again if you want to contact me on on email good at my website am Koch who's dot org\nLet's not have a crystal ball and look far into the future not ten not twenty but over a hundred years in the future what will it be like\nWell there's this heavy for a one set of questions concerns the space program many of you out there are worried about the cost but yeah it's expensive to go into outer space by costs are dropping because of new developments that were usable rockets and the economy of scale\nAnd then the question is well what do we do we go out there\nWell one thing we could do is mind the asteroid belt or Google billionaires a are now entertaining the possibility of capturing an asteroid bringing it back down to the earth and then mining it for platinum chemicals and rare earth\nYou realize that the electronics industry depends upon rare or is or else the Internet goes to put\nAn yet and yet we have a limited supply a rare earth on the planet earth why not mind the asteroid belt so Google billionaires are footing the bill and that's another new feature of the space program the driving force is no longer the taxpayer\nThe driving force is no longer a government officials from NASA were talking about private individuals unleashed by president Barack Obama who want it to commercialize outer space to reduce the costs down the federal budget\nAnd now we have ... mosque space sex we have Jeff Bezos of Amazon dot com we have some of the biggest billionaires footing the bill I mean who would've thought for example a few months ago\nHe line must made headlines by launching the Falcon Heavy now why is that such a big deal why did thousands of people lining up to the streets of Cape Canaveral to watch another rocket blast off from Florida that was no ordinary rocket that\nWas a moon rocket I'm thinking about that I spent fifty years\nFifty years since we last walked on the moon\nAnd yet a private individual using private funds\nHas created his own moon rocket the Falcon Heavy which blasted off from the very same launch pad at Cape Canaveral that said our astronaut as to the moon back in Nineteen sixty nine years later we're going back to the moon\nAnd funded by a private individual he learned must not to be done the richest man on earth Jeff Bezos he's finding an entire space port in Texas the blue origins rocket is his creation\nAnd we have new shepherd which he thinks will take tourists into outer space that new Armstrong rocket which he thinks will take us to to um outer space and eventually to the moon\nAnd so we're talking about private enterprise taking the lead and then the next question is well what do we do once we get to Mars well one thing where you might do is terra form that planet that is making it into another garden of Eden that let's be clear about this is not going to happen anytime soon\nBecause Mars is a frozen desert it's awfully cold out there temperatures rarely go up the freezing point of water\nSo you would have to care for them it one possibility of terra forming Mars is to use satellites soldier satellite orbiting Mars to dean down the sun's energy to melt the polar ice caps see Mars has plenty of water the problem is is frozen water\nAnd the ice caps have locked in much of the ancient water of Mars so why not being solar energy down to the red planet\nTo melt the polar ice caps to begin the process of reviving the ecology of Mars Mars once had great oceans into rivers and lakes believe it or not\nIn fact we think there was an ocean about as big as the United states of America\nThat was once on the red planet so why not begin the process of melting the polar ice caps and once you raise the temperature six degrees then you get a greenhouse runaway effect in other words\nYou get a greenhouse runaway effect in other words it sustains itself\nAnd it basically Tara forums itself once you raise the temperature by that critical temperature of six degrees and so of course this is not for us however maybe our grandkids may have the possibility of beginning beginning to turn Mars into a new home\nAnd that's what it's all about you see Jeff Bezos and you must have a vision not just to beat the Russians we did that we've been there we've done that already a new vision first of all evil on Musk has a vision of becoming a multi planet species that is just simply too dangerous\nTo put humanity on one planet we need a backup plan an insurance policy in case something bad happens to the planet earth\nAnd jak basis also has a vision the richest man on earth believes that the earth should become a card and I mean think about that all the heavy industry all the pollution will be sent into outer space so the earth becomes the park\nAnd garden this glorious place to live while heavy industry and pollution is all done in outer space and to back it up Amazon dot com has announced that they're going to set up a service like Amazon to the moon\nSo our astronaut suit will be able to order any book or anything in the catalog of Amazon dot com so thinking about that the ability of a private individual using his billions of dollars to open up the moon to commerce\nAnd then going even beyond that\nYou must wants to go to Mars that's right now he was asked by the press says he personally want to go to Mars and he was quite blunt he said well is dangerous he expects that some people will die in the process of going to Mars\nHe simply said he wants to go to Mars himself but not on impact\nIs he does not want to die on Mars now the press got his quotations all garbled up he said he learned must did say that perhaps he'll send astronauts to Mars on a one way trip\nWell the media seized on that and says a hot you're telling us that you're going to ask us to Mars to die well they got it wrong because you see a trip to Mars might be into steps first you send a robot to Mars has empty field tanks\nIt mine's the ice and other chemicals on Mars to create rocket fuel\nWhich then fills up and the robot space capsule so the first mission to Mars is robotic to create rocket fuel for the return mission then\nThen humans go to Mars\nAnd switch switch rockets they go from the rocket they came in to the new rocket which which is loaded with rock and feel and they come back\nSo in other words yes it is in some sense a one way trip to Mars but there is a ticket back and the media miss that so no one no one's talking about going to Mars to

that I get\nAnother set of emails concerns health for example cancer why don't we have a cure for cancer I mean we've been to the moon we've conquered all sorts of diseases so why not conquer cancer well you see cancer is different from other kinds of diseases\nIt's not a disease that comes on the outside in the form of a virus or a micro we have ways of defending ourselves against microbes and viruses and things like that cancer is a disease within our own body\nCancer is a defect in our genes so we now know that cancer is four major approximately four major mutations are genes will cause cancer\nThat's why it's so difficult to cure cancer you know we have a human genome project that successfully sequence all the genes of the human body great\nBut the problem is cancer is an affliction of every tissue so in other words there could be thousands of different mutations altogether which can cause cancer in other words cancer is just not one disease\nIs thousands of diseases lumped together into one category so it is cancer a mutation in our genes as simply makes\nCancer cells in Marshall so they live forever and eventually kill us well let's take a short commercial break and then we'll talk about potential cures for cancer and then we'll talk about dinosaurs we'll talk about time travel talked about robots and we'll talk about a year Twenty one hundred\nOkay once again

record year message by calling six\nOne to five six for a one and three five however today we're going to answer your emails however some of you are a gun shy about getting on national radio\nSomebody to simply write your emails to me which is fine so in today show or answering some of the emails that come in again one set of emails concerns cancer and the human genome project why\nDo we have cures for all these diseases now that we have the genome well there are limitations to what we can do with the human genome project the human genome project simply tells us all the genes and\nBasically how they're put together but they don't tell us what they do so it was like a dictionary\nWas all the letters spell correctly with no definitions whatsoever so we still have a long ways to go however as you know DNA research has been quite spectacular recently in catching long term cold case killers [noise]\nWe have the Golden State killer of California I remember years ago when I was in California getting my PHD there\nThat the Golden State killer terrorized terrorize that state he was a Savage just like killing people left and right and then one day he vanished\nOne day he stopped killing people\nAnd they couldn't find him what was the problem well he left his DNA everywhere he ... he raped so many women that there was plenty of DNA out there but the problem was there was no match\nAnd so it's like having a fingerprint of the murder with no matches in other words probably he was a police officer of some sort [noise]\nProbably he was aware of the coming of DNA and it was very careful very careful never to leave his DNA in some kind of repository so decades went by and now we have familial DNA\nSo how do they get the guy given the fact that he left no fingerprints of his own well here's what happened\nNow that we have things like twenty three and me and asked ... dot com and many others sites you can have your own DNA sequence\nFor fun or to find out what's working in your body to find out your health profile of the future\nAnd so more and more people are submitting their DNA now they have the DNA of the killer but there was no match but they could match him with his relatives so even though he himself was very careful not to allow his DNA to be sequenced anywhere else\nHis relatives\nHad no such can function they went into these Web sites that submitted their DNA and so there was a match for his relatives so they did was they took the matches of his relatives into a pool\nAnd they begin to weed the pool how many live in Sacramento\nHow many live in the areas terrorized by the killer how many fit the profile of a white person perhaps in his seventies who lives in the Sacramento area bingo they found him practically on the first try\nAnd so we have yet another tool to fight crime familial DNA\nAnd moving on on science fantastic let's say just a few things about dinosaurs and that is right dinosaurs it turns out that\nThere's still a debate about what killed the dinosaurs most scientists believed that would kill the dinosaurs was a comet or a meteor that slammed into Mexico sixty five billion years ago\nBut some people hold out and say no it was volcanoes a massive set of volcanoes that erupted in India\nOn the other side of Mexico or other side of the earth from Mexico that's what killed the dinosaurs so we had this debate was it an asteroid or was it volcanic eruptions in India\nWell some physicists say it was both both simultaneously both occurred about sixty five million years ago and what's the ...\nBoth simultaneously both occurred about sixty five million years ago and what's the link to link is as follows that meteor or asteroid was slammed into Mexico sent a shock wave a shockwave right through the earth\nTo the other side of the earth where cracked\nThe crust of the earth and that's the link [noise]\nSo perhaps it was one shot\nWhich cause two things to happen one of the volcanoes and to\nThe impact did

responsibility to determine whether Mr cab and others to Supreme Court [noise]\nMy responsibilities to tell you the truth\nTo that was Dr Ford and of course explosive\nTestimony today and hanging in the balance is whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as our next Supreme Court justice what a crazy crazy day I Can't emphasize that enough\nAnd it really was about uh she said the responsibility to tell the truth\nAnd from his perspective here's what judge Kavanaugh had to say is we start here on America Tonight with me Kate till any here's Kevin uh\nUh\nWe'll get back to cabinet where he talks about where he never sexually assaulted anyone\nAnd that was one of the team pieces of testimony where he said I didn't die when he was asked about that he said I never did that and he came came out swinging and\nUm he aligned himself with the president for sure and the president said he was um\n[noise] he said he gave a credible incredible performance as what he called it\nAnd as Trump was tweeting the president was treating during the hearing now here's that little slice of audio from earlier in the day on Thursday which by the way that hearing went for nine hours\nI drank beer with friends\nAlmost everyone did\nSometimes I have too many beers sometimes others did\nI still like fear\nNot treat fear to the point of walking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nSo that's what he said that's what he emphasized when he was asked a couple of different times about that that um they would you want he didn't say what you want but he but he talked about the fact that he didn't do that\nAnd he had other moments where he talked about\nA year book when he was asked about the yearbook constantly what was that in the year book and what the words mean and he had\nPlenty of the senators that lined up for him Lindsey Graham came to bat for him for sure and Lindsey Graham that's on fire ever seen him\nThe senator from South Carolina lashed out of the Democrats saying that the allegations made against the judge or a sham and he said you know are you a gang rape is he screamed at out and Kavanaugh said no and\nUh he said if he wanted an FBI investigation should have come to us he said that looking at other senators what you want to destroy this guy's life hold the seat open and help you win and twenty twenty\nAnd those remarks came right after Senator Dick Durbin was called for Kavanaugh to request an FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations made against him\nSo Graham says you know I tend to ... he sympathizes with Kevin onto the Democrats had no intention of even protecting Dr Christine Blasey Ford the first woman who came forward publicly with the sexual assault allegations\nIt could be on the bench for forty years\nAnd um you know it was high drama for sure\nAnd he did say you may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit never that's what he told the Democrats pretty much and um he said it's destroyed his family's toward his good name the whole two week effort has been calculated and orchestrated a political hit field with\nUm you know a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the twenty sixteen election he\nWas openly contemptuous of the Democrats and demanded\nYou know they answer questions that they asked of him and the Republicans who that mostly listen to forge testimony defended him and really it was more about going after the Democrats not so much Dr Ford\nThe um there's just counter charges and heated exchanges and it's very different from what happened in the afternoon with Kavanaugh than what happened with\nWith a doctor for it and that's not a surprise because she was the one who came forward didn't necessarily that wasn't what was going to happen but then that she would come to Washington and there were questions about\nBecause she couldn't fly on a plane and then how could you go to these other places and there was a really with both of them in a couple of different areas of who hangs in the balance of votes\nArizona's Jeff Flake like I mentioned Alaska's Lisa Murkowski Maine's Susan Collins they're not saying anything about their plans when they were asked us to the hearing\n'em they're not answering they weren't answering questions flake was fast\nIf you know whether he believes for it or not Murkowski said that she's going to go home and have some dinner and have a chance to think about all that's gone on so a Trump said the president judge Kavanaugh showed America why nominated him that's what he tweeted\nAfter the hearing his testimony was powerful honest riveting Democrat search and destroy strategies disgraceful this process has been a total sham an effort to delay obstructing resist the Senate ... votes and there were a comparison to what happened with Justice Clarence Thomas\nWhen his nomination was almost drowned when he was accused of sexual harassment back in Nineteen Ninety One Kavanaugh had something to say like he called us he called it a circus and\nUm that's what Thomas did he said it was a circus too and Kavanaugh called the proceedings the circus and said this confirmation process has become a national disgrace the constitution gives the Senate and important role in the confirmation process but you have\nReplaced advice and consent with search and destroy search and destroy\nSo I mentioned the three whose votes could heavily sway what happens and um\nYou know I have friends on the hill on\nBoth sides I've talked to people who are handicapping nuts and honestly there's just a lot of speculation speculation at this point when the vote comes down will you be surprised I\nPersonally if I'm handicapping this I Do I think he gets confirmed I think that's what's gonna happen let's get a grim ahead of grim you of the floor\nAnd the same boat as usual K yeah I'm not surprised I think he's going to get\nA second I feel positive especially after they announced that are leak\nThat yes and it was more than likely could for him yeah it was kind of a big opposition there\nWhich kind of upset at me because hey it ought to be part of the party get out yeah one of those types or you\nMean you mean flag saying like\nYeah yeah I ... and coke and uh the real damage is really the American public and the committee but there I mean\nRegardless of Kevin off or Mrs before now I Can't throw guilt either way I don't see I don't see\nThe kicker for but he did he can't confirmed that she didn't you know what I'm saying [laughter] yeah\nWell that's the problem the evidence where evidence where what do you how do you do it yeah\nWell first off she got refuted by what would have come from her statements about three people that you know could well no I didn't come from it\nMark ... well yeah of water so far but then then you would have had\nA proof of ... what are your through third no proof you would've had some burden of proof there otherwise it you know there's reason to doubt on both sides so I can swing either way\nAnd the real damage is really more I think it's going to come out to be more for or against women and you know trying to come out but the real damage discover from those committee\nNow ... calling the kettle black is what it is [laughter] yeah that's exactly what the old it is it's a pot calling the kettle black Republican Democrat the whole doggone committee that they're they're just as filthy\nYeah rely on daily basis [laughter]\n[laughter] I don't I don't care who the conspiracies come from and that that's the real damage here's the real damned if you know our government and now there's ten years you know it could lead to the fall\nLiterally I mean isn't that the Roman empire when I'm just waiting for you know what's his name to narrow get up on top of building start pointing to it or burn [laughter]\nThat's what it feels like right yeah it's crazy I mean\nMost of America\nYou look at the vote we talk about this several times half of the country don't even vote yeah sadly\nNot even a third really vote you get past the third but but that two thirds of the country I don't care [noise] yeah I haven't for years yeah so you know they're going they're just keep on going in there but you know but the sea burn\nYeah it is that that sort of dig it was part of it because oh oh oh no [laughter]\nNo I agree I agree I think he'll is it's ridiculous because you know what this is our\nCountry and so I always say that look if you vote then you can complain and wine and talk about it\nIf more people got involved maybe we'd get more people that we wanted to represent us that would represent us maybe more people that I think you'd do a great job would want to be um representatives but it's so reprehensible who wants to walk into the lion's den and like you said there's so much apathy which is so bloody bad\nWhen we have the right to vote and we're not getting shot at when we go to the\nTo uh to to put our votes at these precinct so it's so depressing plenty\nI mean we can start taking the bars all the windows and the door there you go\nThat's that's what I'm getting it maybe we can take the bars off the doors and windows ... this is the problem is all about two years it's just the attitude and when you get one person that wants to jump up you're faced with a stronger and not you know\nTry and work or anything either five [noise]\nI Know a serious problem you've got a theory problem hey that was a great phone call Graham thank you so much have a good one [noise]\nLimited dive on to the other side and I'll meet you over their case all any American tonight [noise]\n\n[noise] on the radio\n[noise]\nAgreement on a trade deal with Canada I'm an Carrick Fox News the United states Mexico Canada agreement us NCA replaces the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\nThe U.S and Canada confirm a new trade deal is done a dairy agreement the same as the Trans Pacific partnership trade agreement rejected by the president is in the new agreement along with exemptions on tariffs on two point six million cars steel and aluminum tariffs are not part of the new agreement\nThe agreement reportedly preserves a NAFTA dispute resolution process something the U.S wanted removed\nCanadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau thing it's a good day for Canada\nMore accusations made public but unsubstantiated Charles Chad ... claims he interacted with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh why like yell now he's telling several media outlets judge Kavanaugh was untruthful during his Senate testimony Fox's at Henry\nMore so than anything else I've ever done and so it is really a big deal because if you were a business owner I mean you can't talk about your business during your car but people think that they really resonate with your talk\nAt the same time you can also list your talk all kinds of places to build your own credibility by ear email signature or anywhere you do your bio or on social media keeping a headache speaker on that list your topic\nOr on social media you can say ... feet are on and let your topic what you spoke on the radio and so\nAll of a sudden it open the doors and gains credibility unlike anything else but the cool thing is even if I only a small number of people watch your talk when people hear you talk immediately they they have to have to listen to this person\nOh yeah it it's a huge game changer\nBoy that's a great tip right there we're speaking with Cory pour a in his book is called the book of public speaking learning to speak and they used to have you done this for the teen years what the coolest thing he's ever gotten could end up a tough question\n... ... is a tough question and I'll I'll I'll leave out at three ... talk because obviously that would be an easy answer if we just literally talking about it um so I Would say you know those are the really big moment\nBut you know it isn't it weird because it doesn't really speaking at all but you know is it true answer comes me right away is actually got to be a volunteer fireman for a day\nBecause a a client you meet a person that that and went to school same places me one of my talk and and told me that he was that he worked for the fire fire ... fire man and woman person training cool\nAnd asked if I wanted to go through the process of what a volunteer fireman died and so he invited me process and I got to live that to me that was a pretty exciting moment and again it wasn't speaking at the same time but it came from speaking\nWow very very cool what do you help people take away from your book\nPeople take away that two things one speaking it's harder than a lot of people think and you know I don't try to scare people out of it but I Want people to realize it's a little harder than people think and I don't mean just\nOn the stage I mean building ... secondly I Want people to realize that no matter where you start even if you're the person sweating on the stage that almost all of this age\n... I've watched probably more speakers that were terrified\nOn a stage and talk more speakers that were terrified when they started to become an amazing speakers and people that were actually born to do it so I Hope people can read to that and the book and realized that can be learned and I can learn it too so that that would be my whole take away\nI Love that and see because you're on the different stages one thing that happened\nHe talked about being a volunteer fireman per day and what an awesome experience that was but you also have brushes with fame because when we travel and you're at different events a lot of times there are some celebrities that are on hand and I know you've interviewed a bunch of them do you have a favorite one\nThat I get that question a lot and it's a hard one to say a favor let's say interviewer person but I can tell you a and this is still probably a favor because of this reason but I very memorable and in fact um there's two that stand out but one is a gentleman named Robin ...\nBroke them uncles all those Ferrari and other international best selling book\nAnd I did the interview with him while I had to take\nAnd I didn't want to reveal that the interview to the capital\nAnd so I had to drink water to ease the to the but the factor that uh you don't consider when you drink that much water is now I'm going to need to go to the bathroom [laughter]\nAnd so the whole interview if you don't you'd never know that was kind of a win but at the same time I was pretty distracted at my head the whole time during the interview so it made it very memorable\nAnd then Jack Canfield the chicken soup for the soul creator it took four months to get that interview and there's a whole backstory as to how and when I had to do to actually make that interview come to life and get hurt\nAnd so because of those reasons and both of those gentlemen delivered and knocked out of the power because of those reasons those would be the most memorable and perhaps along the lines of among the favorites as well\nI absolutely love it that's cool very cool I Love the thing that that had to be something sitting there with your your team is\nRobbing I've only had [noise] luckily one of the Cory but it's a horrible but I don't know how you did they tried to get it out I Can't run [noise] you mean by that I like\nBrutal I pick up this book it's the talk of public speaking learning the queen ... thank you so much for joining us now on the show\nWas my absolute pleasure thank you very much for inviting me\n\nUh when you use public life hackers and identity sees the anything you do on line\n... photos your Web history even your passwords\nThat's why I use the Internet access to my Internet connection for less than a day now is probably the Internet access dot com and in just a few minutes you'll be browsing anonymously and sharing what you want to\nRead the Internet access\nI Am Dr building go M.

Supreme Court\nJust to see the highest court in the land that my friends one hangs\nIn the balance the clock is ticking so far that nine thirty meeting that confirmation meeting is going to be held as far as we know I have some friends and then put me a little bit of information because of course all the staffers are running around\nKind of take you back on and not necessarily the nasty way just kind of unofficial pool because like all of us they want to know how the story and as it affects all of us in America who better to have on this show and Bob Ney the former congressman from Ohio from talk media news\nBob your impressions of what you saw today\nI was there during the impeachment of Bill Clinton and that was a longer process but I must say this was in my opinion\nI'm a more incredible and in other ways a in a sense I'm not comparing to the peace and just the absolute within a short period of time drama and everything you would look at a\nRight when you look at this who who could go in a different direction I mean everything's party line but when you look at least the Murkowski for example senator Collins so Senator Murkowski senator Collins\nAnd Senator Jeff flake is another one that seems to be up in the air I say seems to be up in the air we we don't know that for sure I Know from my own sources there's lots of conversations going on behind the scenes with aids except for trying to figure out what it is the way the Senate math works\nThere than it is fifty one forty nine if Democrats unite against Kavanaugh which is a question too [laughter] um Republicans can lose one vote and still confirming by using a tie breaking vote by the VP my pets they cannot lose two votes those that tight so that's the question after the\nReally frankly long arduous process of seeing both of them out of the few senators figure out what they saw and the way they're going to vote\nThat clearly what the breaks down to\nSo there may be another Republican that waffles I mean we don't know it seems it seems unlikely to me I mean Collins is up for reelection and twenty twenty Murkowski is up for reelection and twenty twenty two\nSo for them and you know if it's trying to keep moderates on board what are they willing and then\nFrankly wouldn't it be a novelist ideas he really decided what you thought I'm not worried about when I'm running again and if we're all going to still be here on the hill I'm going to really way my options and go with what I think is the correct way to go\nSo there's going to be pressure that will mount on certain asides for example Democrats up for reelection red states like\nMansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana\nAnd that's how the ball bounces this this this is what it's about\nSo the clock is out there it's chicken and the nation watched I think what happens those that could those they couldn't we're following it on Twitter they were listening to what other ways through streaming if it wasn't just flat on the tubes from where they were working\nThere are plenty of opinions about what we saw what we heard what we think\nAnd where this is all headed\nDo you believe her account he believe his account do you think there's holes in both of those stories and I think\n\nOut all involved here um how much what happened to all of that it's it's like um talk to anyone who's ever blacked out from\nAll of that it's it's like um\nTalk to anyone who's ever blacked out from alcohol and what they remember them saying blacked out too many tequila shots too much bruised especially kids I mean ... it's a whole different thing so we're not talking about feeling a little queasy a little I'm with a little bit burnt out\nFrom a no food too many drinks we're talking about\nProbably a maybe a blackout scenario maybe I'm the friend in that situation who\nTo mark judge that everybody's talking about he clearly wrote about alcohol and clearly is grappling with that and and this is not available or has not been made available and made a statement but it is not available for any of this and there are now\nOthers who are calling for\nMore to come for the FBI to get involved here but I I don't see that happening\nI think the Senate panel is just going to is going to vote on Kavanaugh that's it if this vote is happening where we would have heard that called off I'd be very because it can happen to the last second but I'd be very very surprised if you want to weigh in you know you can always here eight five five\nTo six six fifty two eighty three eighty five five to six six\nFifty two eighty three\nYou heard just a little slice there about the trauma and and uh and and what that was like Lindsey Graham had his own take on what this must be like for Kavanaugh he really exploded at one point\nUh during the hearing here's what he said\nDo you consider this a job interview the advice and consent of roles like a job you consider that you've been through a job interview [noise]\nI've been through a process of his life and comes under the constitution to say you've been through hell\nAnd uh and and so this is not a job interview\nThis as hell to those remarks happened after Senator Dick Durbin called for cabinet tour question FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations made against him\nGraham said he went on after what you just heard there to say he's sympathizes with Kavanaugh and the Democrats had no intention of protecting\nChristine Blasey Ford the first woman who came forward with the sexual assault allegations against\nA cabin or so [noise] you know he ... he said listen let me tell you when it comes to this is what he said to judge Kavanaugh you're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friends it was clearly he was frustrated\nAnd that's when this fiery comments came out from Lindsey Graham he says he believes Ford was betrayed by the person who released her letter\nWhich was sent to the Democratic senator that we've talked about Feinstein a\nBall and the allegations that he said I think she's just much victim his cabinet as because some of the crater trust and the people who portrayed her trust they over her an apology and that\nThat goes to the okay what happened with the letter and then and then when it's release and that going back to it needed to be released sooner if you have that letter and you have that conversation and then it's going to end up\nComing to this and and what can be said as she didn't want it to be revealed okay [noise]\nUm she didn't want it to be revealed and then it was one a waiting game to see if if he was going to be the nominee them once he's a nominee so it was a really hairy\nI kind of a\nKind of a creepy day frankly to kind of a creepy ... oldest hanging over de ... de that washed over the rest of us I think in the U.S and I was monitoring social media\nAnd let me tell you it's pretty much that goes what I said where you've got decides\nIts its side this was like watching a football game it's like deciding what side are you on ... who do you believe after these Kavanaugh hearings what do you think is going to happen\nAnd he had the bulk of the afternoon so on the Twittersphere\nThe conversations were geared toward that cause they everybody had already heard her and um\nYou know the emotion was brought up and some people liked it some people didn't like it the um center lay he asked Kevin if he is bart cabin on mark judges book\nAnd he refused to answer then he said that he said he didn't think mark judge you have to testify and it kind of was that back and forth wasn't kind of it was that back and forth\nYou know all the way around so which is it's who's right\nWhere do they go from here I think quite honestly it's going to just be that vote and what happens in that vote is what happens in that that vote\nAnd then that's it I mean ...\nHash tag is the Kavanaugh hearing is done and what comes out of that is is simply\nWho do you believe to believe him she believes her\nDo you think um [noise]\nHe should be the next Supreme Court justice I mean there's the other questions that some people are asking including Steve Schmidt who was a long\nRepublican operative who worked on many Republican campaign and he doesn't think he should be a judge he doesn't have the decorum for any America Tonight [noise]\nOne of radio\n\nAgreement

I Know we've got people listening to us who are ... than\nThe Yankees a starter bacteria within the middle of a one hit are tuning shy of earning a half million dollar incentive based bonus but he was a jet kid from Thursday afternoons game at the crop\nHe pitched um\nHe editor Thursday's game having such a hundred and forty eight innings in the season\nIn what would be the final sort of the year you needed to last through the seventh in order to make it to a hundred and fifty five innings and get the bonus he was talked about the home plate umpire and the bottom of the six after throwing in Ninety two mile an hour cutter into the race catchers left leg\nAnd bath you said I don't really make decisions based on money I just felt like it was the right thing to do ... how the half million dollar pitch\nThat'll go down in history right and it was the yanks when twelve one over the race but he lost all that money\nSo I guess at an original a warning and one step all went in there that was it it was only the fifth objection of his career so he's not necessarily known for that has been around for a long time but um\nYeah that was it against the Yankees organization save some money anyway if you want to look at it that way if your college football fan it's interesting 'cause this is a big week in college football and they already have one in and out of Miami\nBeach you and the forty seven to ten forty seven and and then there was some conversation about the ... and a couple of days ago the Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant is transferring from Clemson after losing the starting job\nHe doesn't want to be the motives and that's what happens a lot you see a lot of quarterbacks move on to other opportunities he started a lack of Eighteen games for the tigers but he was told on Monday that he was demoted in favor of the freshmen Trevor Lawrence and the coach taboos a Sweeney\nSaid it was emotional he gave Bryant the day off from\nAnd he skipped practiced on Tuesday\nBut he said he was you know he wanted to he wanted to transfer and he did say he did say this he said I was like I'm not discouraging Trevor\nHe's doing everything asked of them but on my side of it I feel like I haven't done anything not to be the starter I've been here with my turn up then everything y'all\nHave asked me to do which\nThe well that's true but this is how it goes in college football whoever you think a better guy is let's hear putting and the and the you know the Sean ... than was the guy a couple of years ago who ends up being the the quarterback for the Houston Texans\nSo Bryan started the first four games this season I ... splits time with Lawrence\nNow they've got these red shirt rules this season Bryant a senior has an opportunity to transfer Trotter school one year of eligibility remaining because he played in only four games this season so that's why he had to do that so that he can he can be the red shirt guy so he can go to another team\nAnd a Sweeney said that he was saddened and disappointed that Brian made the decision to leave\nBut he said you know as far as the decision as a coach sometimes you have to make tough decisions that are in the best interest of the team and this is one of those decisions that I Would make it all over again because I Believe that's what it's right for our team I feel like Kelly would have continued to help them play a lot but that's not what\nWe wanted to do I you know he said that's not what he wants to do I would have started him I could have started him but he would have had limited options so that's it and Lawrence has the bigger numbers he's got to send a passing yards and nine touchdowns and\nSo they made that switch and he's playing the rules meaning he go someplace else and that's what happens because when you're a quarterback and especially if you think you have some kind of a chance to go to the pros you want people to the play you want to have big heroes games and\nHave those big daddy games that you'll get a more look in the draft when you decide to come out if that's the case and then just in some cases [laughter] just because you want to be the person you want to have all you don't want to be the backup or [noise]\nThe guy who got it he didn't win but now we're on a different direction [noise]\nWonder where he pops up next there's a couple of teams that could use a

A. we are broadcasting live in our Bloomberg interactive brokers studios and ... the editor calmness and blogger and em life go on at the Bloomberg joining us now\nThe tension is off the table there will be a new NAFTA everything is looking a little bit rosy or how does that playing out and stop today\nWell I guess a little bit would be a good way to put it that said I mean you've got to the U.S in the five hundred a pretty solid gain up seven tenths of ... percent of the moment and there was a an obvious story there with General Electric good now the shares a kind of baffled\nOff that get on the general electric let's just stop there okay I have a new CEO why is this being taken in such a positive\nBecause this is a guy what Larry Cole who they brought in to replace John flattery he ran down on her he broke up that company gave it more of a focus Dan are used to be sort of lives gender\nGED I couldn't ... it's an amazing story that what happened I mean you know this day but I mean this had to do for example at one point Dana her own the company that made the pumps that when you go to a filling station ... those were the pumps the pump the ... the the fuel\n... my favorite was that they own the companies that make crescent wrenches\nOkay great and what they did was they he completely transformed into a life sciences company and he did it successfully so maybe that's why\nAs it has anything to the ads experience in overhauling a company now jeeze been trying to overhaul itself for years unsuccessfully I mean ... and I say that knowing that the stock good last week on to its lowest price since two thousand nine\nWhen I was just starting to recover from the effects of the financial crisis\nGoes GE back that much more involved in finance so when you put it all together the reason you have this kind of reaction as a people are optimistic that cope will be better suited to transforming this company then John flattery was now we only had fourteen months which isn't all that\nLong when she was dealt a very difficult hand\nWhile he was I mean there there is no question that a this was a company that it would have been difficult for anyone to deal with that said the men the decision has been made demands been changes taking place says how are\nYou going to try and they just also ride off his huge amount of their power unit\nAbsolutely basically took a good well which is this accounting charge typically related to deals or should say the counting asset related and deals\nAnd turn that into a charge me it's going to be most of the twenty three billion dollars of good will they have in the book so there's they're realizing\nThat you know things are different now I'm In and this is an area that struggled with a they'd had issues with ah some turbines that are one of their customers that came up in the past couple of months and arguably that was enough to help seal flannel restate\nOK so not to believe or the point we are going to be speaking with General Electric about General Electric next hour or more in depth\nBut one thing that I Do find interesting this is the indebted company with more than a hundred billion dollars in debt and there's a big question about whether they'll get downgraded and the interesting thing is even as stocks surged by more than twelve percent in the minutes of trading uh since the open the bombs are not that much\nAt all in fact it perpetual bonds are up a little bit taken hired by that you know a little bit less than half a percentage point this is not a major move given the fact that you're seeing such a huge pop and equity just interesting now to\nBear in mind what benefits shareholders doesn't necessarily benefit bondholders and you want to do with a smaller company\nOut of cold smoke right then the west cash flow to pay the interest to repay the principal so it's understandable that you'd see a bit of a different reaction from bond investors then you're clearly getting from stock investors\nYeah indeed and that could also mean that they were that renegotiate some of their credit lines you don't know with a smaller company collateral might not be there\nYeah well if that's the case it's kind of ridiculous but they're an investment grade rated company just moving ... that's a whole lot of discussion but moving more broadly into what's going on in markets today I mean you do wonder about a President Trump's new NAFTA packed\nAt that has come out and it's definitely supporting the looney a dollar losing the most ... yeah diverse is that the looney since she doesn't seven since about a year in about a year sort of interesting I mean it seems like some people are saying it's we're branding but there's a sign markets\nWell there is I mean you take this off the table and at the very least this issue that's out there in terms of where economies are more corporate profits are headed uh it it it's off the table because everything's been brought to the table and there's been an agreement\nI just had come back to ... for a second because it is that it is a story of\nThe day you have to bear in mind when you talk about the bonds this was once they AAA rated company\nBack before the financial crisis so you know if it's come down a bit since then still a an investment grade right in the middle of the range you might say so I mean clearly the the on bond investors have been through a lot already now you have the potential for more\nBut I mean to me this is a fascinating case because it was investment grade it still is investment grade it is not hard to see how a restructuring could land it with a lower credit grade\nThat makes it more expensive to borrow and then also really royals to market credit markets which have been very robust what happens at a time when rates are rising and they're facing more term turbulence and our credit rating it just becomes a downward cycle\nIt's a pressure that's out there for a company that has been hurt a lot of leverage over time that they had that they got cheaply due to their high credit rating and I find that fat wraps\nThat's part of the reasoning why the board selected Larry called to do the job and forced out Mr plan or it can I just mention one other stock just Roku just because I've been watching the fourteen loves Roku what I've been looking at what's the stock of this was a thirty seven dollars stock on Memorial Day and\nIt is now trading it's Seventy seven thirty one it's been an amazing move for Roku and I just mentioned that because we're always talking about Netflix and Netflix is a big gain or today or their shares are about two and a half percent it's\nMoved past almost every price estimate among the wall street analysts\nFor about two and a half percent it's moved past almost every price estimate among the wall street and it was brought a new one today need um raised its um twelve month projections to eighty five dollar so at least there was one out there that it won't get past perhaps and and so we'll see\nTable Sam ... editor columnist and blogger and in life go on the Bloomberg thank you so much and you\nKnow ... you do love folk who don't you\nI like all that stuff because I find the technology amazing that you don't actually have to watch commercials it's amazing\nJust wonderful right now let's head over twenty nine when studios in Washington DC and even ... there were all the national headlines Nathan\nLisa we're waiting comments from President Trump on the new trade pact with Canada and Mexico White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that\nUm and ah I think this was they just had to get\nSomething done quickly and he's a very good operate if he's a lot of credibility on the street because of his history and I just felt I just think they gave up on ...\n... if you got to if let's say Larry Cole Cole Karen you will heart I should tell me based on your experience covering G. E.\nWhat do you think is the most important thing I should focus on right\nNow well clearly it's its power but um I was a little disturbed um that he that plan or he was going to make power the largest business and GE with\nAn operating margin goal of ten percent\nUh you know that is not a solid plan I'm an iguana or you know a ten percent operating marching company and you need a much higher you know uh that's not going to please shareholders I'm Larry call came in down her was at ten percent it was a twenty three percent margin when he left I mean ah you know so I said that is not going to be enough\nUh he's got to\nShrink power quickly um I think it's got to sell off pieces of power and and that's what he has his editor of processed in our business systems does get down to the granular level and I think he's going to look at that not as one business but as many businesses try to stop the bleeding as much as they can they're\nI think he made me think some of those assets sales like health care uh you know and because that is a good business or that they were getting rid of because they needed cash 'em I think you'll be able to pull cash out of the different businesses there's a lot of ... and and uh down our business systems help solve\nThis problem so one thing that we were talking about earlier is that even though you're saying that rally in jail is shares you're not seeing a commensurate rally in the company's bonds and they have a lot of them may have a more than a hundred and twelve billion dollars of debt or you're not seeing the same\nPop I'm just wondering a much smaller General Electric how will they right size their debt portfolio right now the massive\nAh that's that's a you know that's a good question he's got to generate a you know cash to be able to you know a retire it and that's going to be AS number one priority I think uh\nYou think that AS number one priority is going to be dealing with the ... the massive amount of debt well also shrinking the company and making sure that it provides it yes and and the ... I mean I'm not I'm not I'm not the credit guy of course but but uh the rating was always vulnerable and now they just took twenty three billion dollars in a good will run up and you know we're down to\nThe value of the company quite substantially so that should have some implications too although that's a good thing I think\nIs a is it a job that Larry couple find a little easier because he is not a gi veteran\nI think the fresh look it'll make it easier for him to take you know take some you know bigger actions one of the negatives against flattery was yes he was a fresh\nUm you know a new CEO but he was a G. E. generated if you will and so this gives him a ... a chance\nI think the one thing that's most interesting as\nHe was a builder of a business right and now he's got to be a de constructor of a very large business so um it's gonna be a different kind of challenge I think one thing I'm struck by is that gee is tasked with a shrinking dramatically and\nQuickly at a time when they're increasing trade tensions between the U.S and China\nHow does that affect evaluations that they're going to be able to realize when they do try to go and so quickly that that\nA good question um I think a lot of their businesses like the health care business for example a lot of businesses are producing local you know they're operating locally um and you haven't really seen multiples come down that much and I'm In a U.S so I'm so far with the trade tensions so\nI wouldn't put that on the top of the list of concerns\nMe a potential liability that you're still faces because of payouts having to do with the pensions and so on what can you tell us there\nThe longer that the pension you know hey ... they're going to look a little bit on the pension because interest rates are going up and and and they already have lowered the pension somewhat as a result of that on some cash they put in there putting six billion dollars into it\nUh that's going to be less of a problem I think the concern is what else is in that black hole like the long term liability that he'll lawn backed it right yeah um\nCoal like the long term liability that line that said yeah um so I think that's the concern like what else is in that the credit to um I think pension\nThey're chipping away at it and I got to get lucky with where and just write talks are going and are expected to do just twenty seconds I'm just wondering how does it affect GE that they're going to basically have for sales does that reduce the prices that people will be willing to offer them\nI said well you know so far what they've sold they actually did a little bit better than expected on almost all of them\nUm it's a hot market for for for him in a so um\nI don't think they'll they'll do something in desperation heat them up methodical guy I it's going to be interesting because he has to move fast\nBut he also doesn't want to make no mistake 'cause it's it's it's not an easy challenge I mean right now the top as you know everyone's excited about him but it's gonna be an uphill battle for him to\nThe uh looking to share so General Electric they are higher right now by more than twelve percent our thanks to Karen Google hard

time we'll be hearing us MCA\nHas a good ring to it I have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars that it's a much higher number than that [noise] with Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money\nGot lost four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs to us about twenty five percent of birth order jobs even more than the throughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nBut for twenty five years as a civilian as a businessman I used to say how could anybody have signed a deal like NAFTA and I've watched New England and so many other places where I was just the factories were leaving the jobs are leaving people being fired\nSo we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity [noise]\nTo me it's the most important word and trade because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations all over the world that we're changing that [noise]\nJust signed a much better deal with South Korea we had a horrible horrible deal and we just signed up at\nThe United nations says that's worked out well and they're happy we're happy it's good for jobs good for a lot of things when that deal was signed they said two hundred and fifty thousand jobs\nWill be given the by signing this transaction then they were right I've said it before they were two hundred and fifty thousand jobs to South Korea not to the United states so that's

important for our country frankly and from Mexico\nUh so they work together on this this was done by both I said look I don't want to sign an agreement and then a new president comes and they don't like it and we have difficulty ah they work very much together on it and I appreciate it from both\nTo certainly\nMy highest regards\nHave to certainly\nGet my highest regards to prime minister of Canada Justin\nTrudeau [noise]\nA lot of stories came out about that adjusted and I\nHaving difficulty together do we did over the trade deal but\nI'll tell you it's turned out to be a\nVery very good deal for both and a very very good deal for all three it puts us in a position that we've never been in before answering good when you look at the world and what the world is doing and what when you look at the unfair trade practices that countries are using against the United states\nUh this is a terrific deal for all of us\nWants to approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country where the most advanced protections for workers ever\nDeveloped if you look at the reviews people that would normally not under any circumstances say good things because automatically they have to say bad even some Democrats say that's amazing we had some they they haven't been given the soundbite she had I guess my but\nTo actually had some Democrats say this is really amazing if he really got all of that [noise] but by tomorrow I Would suspect they'll change their tune but that's okay because people know how good it is it's an amazing deals for a lot of people like why is it will be the most advanced trade deal\nIn the world with ambitious provisions on the digital economy\nAnd it's very important financial services in other areas where the United states has a strong competitive advantage Mexico and Canada have agreed to strong new labor protections environmental protections and new protections for intellectual\nSo important this new deal is an especially great victory for our farmers are farmers have gone through a lot over the last Fifteen Years they've been taken advantage of by everybody prices have gone way down\nWe're working on some other deals that are going to make I'm very happy also but this is a very very big deal for our farmers to\nMexico and Canada\nWill be opened up a lot more than they are now and I think there'll be a better spirit between the three countries which is important for farmers the agreement will give our farmers and ranchers far greater access to cell American Grown produce in Mexico\nAnd in Canada the deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to export American wheat poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name if you want to be very specific [noise]\nAnd many other products but those products or we're [noise] not really being treated fairly as far as those that work so hard to produce them\nNow they're going to be treated fairly these measures will support many hundreds of thousands of American Jobs [noise]\nThis is also a historic win for American manufacturers and American auto workers who have been treated so badly we've lost so many jobs over the years under NAFTA under the current new deal\nThan if you look at the current NAFTA deal [noise]\nThe new deal as taking care of all of these problems 'cause NAFTA foreign companies have been allowed to manufacture many of their parts overseas shipped them to Mexico and Canada for assembly and send their foreign made cars into the United states when no tax\nSo we let people go we fire everybody\nThey make cars they make products they make everything\nIn another country they send them into the United states no tax [noise]\nAnd the cost has very little difference sometimes it's more\nFor those people that like to talk about cost where this agreement we're closing all of these terrible loopholes that flows that God there were a disaster for example we're requiring a large portion of every car to be made by high wage workers which will greatly reduced foreign outsourcing which was a tremendous problem\nAnd means more auto parts and automobiles will be manufactures\nInside the United states we will be manufacturing many more cars and our companies won't be leaving\nDollars his group doesn't know about those numbers I wanted to hear the stone [noise]\nThe United states it a trade deal has lost\nAverage almost eight hundred billion dollars a year that's dealing with China dealing

economy\nIn really essential ingredients to\nNational security\nWe can't allow what's been happening over the last twenty five years to happen [noise]\nWe're building our military like never before it'll be the strongest it ever was that all of those jets set a maid and rockets and missiles and ships they're all being made in the United states jobs\n[noise] our economy is booming like never before jobless claims already fifty year low the stock market is at a time I think of that over fifty\nPercent since my election fifty percent people the fall one k.'s and a half four oh one k.'s and they were dying with them for years\nNow they're so happy [noise]\nI was telling the story I often tell of the policemen in New York came up [noise]\nHis wife was always very upset with him as an investor\nBecause he wasn't doing well with the four oh one K. is now she thinks he's a genius\nBecause the numbers are so crazy but we're up over fifty percent since\nAnd you've heard me say this many time an African American unemployment Asian unemployment Hispanic unemployment\nLows in history not you know for the last two years the history of our country African American Asian Hispanic [noise]\nYoung people without high school diplomas\nAt historic that's a very important sector\nFall at historic lows\nLowest in history and certainly something that's great [noise]\nThis is helping so much with\nPeople that get out of prison we have a tremendous problem people come out of prison they can't get a job [noise]\nEmployers don't want to hire him but the economy is so good they're hiring them and they're turning out to be incredible\nWorkers they given a chance to really give it a second given a third chance in some cases\nBut I've had numerous employers come up say I'll tell you what I've taken [noise] people that were in prison\nWe've hired them people wouldn't have done this in a normal economy or a bad economy only in this kind of an economy that now he's like the biggest fan one man in particular is taking numerous people said most of them had been unbelievable you could ask is most\nBut most of them had been unbelievable that's a great thing that's a really great thing it gives them a chance\nSo before we take questions I Want to extend our warmest condolences to\nThe country of\nFriend of mine were going to be calling up to the leader\nWho is a great leader indeed [noise]\nBut they got hit by a giant sooner army\nPeople have not seen this part of the world has seen it so much fortunately they say that's the worst of all you look at the tornadoes hurricanes you looked at all of the different natural disasters friend of mine who studies natural disasters I don't know why he does that but he does\nHe says the suit that that should allow me is the worst of all and\nThey got hit very hard and probably thousands of people killed we have already sent\nA lot of first responders and military and others to help\nBut it's a really bad bad situation and finally before closing I Want to send our thoughts and prayers to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting\nThat was a horrible horrible [noise]\nTime in the life of our country [noise]\nTook place exactly one year ago today all of America is grieving for the lives lost and for the families [noise]\nThey left behind so to all of those families and to the people of Las Vegas we love you we are with you\nWere working with you very hard [noise]\nI was a terrible terrible event\nSo thank you very much for that [noise]\nI Want to ask a Bob Lighthizer who uh\nIs just a terrific individual as well as a man that knows\nA lot about this subject to come up and say a word about the U. S. M. C. A. [noise]\nThe new agreement and ah if you have any questions will take some questions after that plays Bob [noise]\nThank you Mr President before I saw it I Would just like to get rid of it yet because I think it says something about working for the president\nSo August sixteen last year we started this process\nAnd I'm at a hotel in Washington and there's like you know hundreds and hundreds of people waiting to have the introduction of myself and my two counterparts one from Canada one for the United states\nAnd I'm getting were lined up and I and I get a caller says the president wants to talk to so I go into the little any room like on the cell phones browsers and start talking and everybody's kind of waiting and he's talking and he's going through what he wants to get done in the afternoon\nAs problems with it all of which is quite familiar with\nAnd then he finally says two things which I thought were tele one he said Bob I Will back you up like no other us here are backed up in history [noise]\nAnd then the second that he did that by the way and then the second thing he said was sitting out go out there and have fun [laughter]\nI thought well it's probably not going to be as much fun from my ... woman from your side I'm proud to be on your team and I really am ... to ... to ... through this and the other uh and the other trade changes\nAs you said Mr President disagreement is a story in many ways the U.S MCA will cover\nOne point two trillion dollars easily make the that's the biggest agreement in history that we have done this in fourteen months [noise]\nAnd believe me in trade negotiating terms like warp speed\nWhen we began these negotiations last year\nThe president instructions to me were precise straightforward protect American workers\nFight for farmers and ranchers preserve America's competitive innovation edge secure greater access for our businesses and above all bring back jobs to America I think we have succeeded with disagreement\nUs MCA will accelerate the manufacturing renaissance our country has enjoyed under President Trump it will bring our trading relationship with Mexico and Canada into the twenty first century\nWill protect America's competitive agent digital and and innovation or across the economy\nThe new agreement will also served as a template for our trade agreements under that ... ... in the future\nThis paradigm shifting model rests on three pillars [noise]\nFirst bill or as fairness\nWe have negotiated stronger rules of origin for automobiles which will bring billions of dollars of manufacturing back to America [noise]\nWe have secure greater market access\nAnd you're factoring back to America\nWe have secure greater market access for our farmers and ranchers\nWe've agreed to unprecedented labor standards\nThat will help level the playing field for our workers\nWe've also agreed to our first of its current review and termination provision which will ensure that the u._s. MCAA on like NAFTA will not become\nUnbalanced and out of date second pillar consist of a host of ambitious provisions on digital prayed it'll actual property services including financial services designed to protect our competitive edge\nThird pillar consists of new provisions designed to eliminate unfair trade practices including strong new disciplines on state owned enterprises on currency manipulation relations with non market economies are much much more\nWe wouldn't be here today if it were not for several people who contributed so much to this Endeavour [noise]\nFirst the president's key adviser and my good friend Carey cush there it was my partner in leading us to go\nDoes\nNot have happened if it wasn't for for your self respect\nI'd like to thank my counterparts\nSecretary Guardia wouldn't minister Friedland as well as other Mexican and Canadian government officials including secretary it'd be the great\nAmbassadors ya de Jerry Buss and Katie to offer to Canada and so many more I'd also like to thank the wonderful staff at U. S. T. R. many of whom are on here [noise] I like to think of us a little bit like we were the marine corps and so I like the name particularly this elusive agreement\nMine learned how you can target Lyme disease at target line dot org\n\nTalk sports Ninety seven one F. M. W. B. C. of radio\nHere in the eye and tell you I all I Know as we made a deal [noise] the highly respected presidents and then the case of Canada the prime minister or\nAre satisfied with the deal\nIs good for Canada good from actually for all three\nHour NPR joining us our friend and I want American is channel or a deadly you anything so much for Kaine were less than a private and trying to deliver remarks about ... training with Canada and Mexico ... than the NAFTA\nAnd this is much more of a reciprocal deal for the United states which is really good yeah go ahead Peter [noise]\nMove on to cap it off briefly for the purposes of why don't you just oh we'll do the capital\nQuestions I mean\nYou talk about being treated\nHarshly [noise] uh well do that in a couple of let's finish up trying 'cause you have a lot of people that want to run over to the wall Street Journal and start writing\nAll in place\nDuring those I Can't hear you\n\nI'm Mexican journalist go ahead I'm sure it's so you're going to keep it started some seal another medium to Mexico and Canada until\nSuch time as we can do something that would be a different like quotas perhaps so that our industry is protected we are not going to allow our steel industry to\nDisappear it was almost gone I'll tell you what if our country kept going the way it was going within two years you wouldn't have had a steel industry we have to have a steel industry we have to have it aluminum you know there are certain industries important so\nWe are working on that now that wasn't part of this but we will do something and in fact Bob if you want you might want to say a couple of words about that because we're literally talking about that one hour ago\nThey had to say thank you Mr President I guess I Would say first of all they're two separate things as far as we're concerned we know that there are a great interest to both countries we are engaged in talks now was an effort to try to preserve the the effect of our program and still take care of their needs and and the hopefully we'll be able to work that out but we are in communication with the ...\nAnd really take care of the needs of our steel companies I don't want plants lousy\nThey're hiring thousands of workers all over the country I'm not giving that up\nBut to get as soon as as a president elect looks sort of ... we\nHave a we have a very good understanding a really good\nUh yes go ahead please [noise]\nI Am Mr President just told me you can uh just reiterate on the terrorists what specifically what it takes for Canada or Mexico to be exempt from these tariffs and secondly did you consider dairy the deal breaker came to the area was a deal breaker\nAnd now for our farmers it's as you know substantially opened up much more [noise]\nI Know they can't open completely that farmers also\nYou know they can't be overrun and I fully on and I tell them that I say look I understand you have limits but they could do much better and we've opened it up to our farmers so the\nFolks up in Wisconsin I I'll tell you what I went to Wisconsin I went to Iowa Joni knows better than anybody right and Scott Walker who I think is a fantastic governor talks about it all the time\nOur farmers were not treated properly by Canada now they're going to be treated with respect\nThat they're going to be treated fairly\nOr as I say in that reciprocal way can very important yes go ahead\nSince president um [noise] if he was there was some give and take on both sides for this deal I Wonder what's in your view would be your biggest concession to Canada and why you decided to make that concession number two if you could die in a bit more to the\nTo your thoughts on Justin Trudeau you talked about tensions I Wonder what you throughout this process what you've learned about him and what the state of the relationship is with him today and going forward [noise]\nWell I think my biggest concession it would be making the deal\nBecause\nAre the one that people come and Warner take from [noise] am talking about every country and that gives us a tremendous advantage in negotiating that we never used before with past administration we never use it\nEvery day and we have is a loser\nEvery day you could look at almost every country in the world almost every country we have trade deficits we lose with everybody\nSo I think my biggest concession was making the deal because we could have done it a different way but it would have been nasty and it wouldn't have been nice and I don't want to have that we have a great relationship with Canada I think now it will be better than ever all the only problem with Justin is he loves his people and he's you know fighting hard for his people\nYou know we've always had actually a very good relationship it get a little got a little bit testy in the last couple of months\nThat was over this agreement and I understand that but no I think I think uh Justin ... a good person who's doing a good job he he felt very committed to his people and that's what he did\nAnd again this is a this is good for everybody to go to Canada good from Mexico also\nYes yes please please go ahead [noise]\nThank you Mr President as you mentioned you're going to be signing this agreement and your counterparts going to be signing a cigarette right from the next sixty days\nThen it's up to Congress right you're very confident I get that you're putting out at all confident [laughter] I'm not trying to think that he told me if you guys going to tell me I think I think they went along versus controlled by Democrats could happen to have lost that yeah they might\nBe willing to throw out of the great deals for people and the workers they may be willing to do that for a political person you know people are political purposes because frankly uh you know they'll have twenty twenty in mind\nSo far I Dream about twenty Twenty one I look at what's going they have twenty twenty in mind they want to they want to do as well as they can and so trying to reject even great deals like this is a great deal for our country great for other countries\nBut it's a great deal for our country and great for a worker I can tell you whether or not they will obstruct whether or not they will resist I mean the whole campaign\nIs resist I see the signs all resist they don't even know what they're resisting if you ask them what are you resist that well let me think about that they can ask they had somebody on this weekend they should what are you resisting\nThey were unable to answer the question [noise]\nSo you know I I Can't tell you about\nDelay obstruct resist because you know right after this election and I think we're going to do well although history is not on our side I guess in history a generally whoever has the White House doesn't do well in midterms but one difference as we have the greatest economy and the history of our country I think that's a big difference\nAnd that's one of our problems too because people that went out and voted for me and they wouldn't be voting for me if I was on the ticket but I'm not on the ticket but Congress is on the ticket and I try and tell my people that's the same thing as me\nIn a sense that's the same thing think of it is the same thing as me but I think we're going to do ah\nWell I actually I think I mean we have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago when I started looking at it closely I won't mention names but there were senators that we're not in play they were not even and you know exactly what I'm Talking about numerous of them they were not in play\nOther words let's not go here let's not go to the states\nThey were not in play\nThan the words let's not go here let's not go to this day four or five states\nNow it's down there like even races in one case they're up two points now who knows what that means and you know as you know there are a lot of ... repression poles or polls that aren't very accurate because I see polls that I Know are false having to do with certain other races\nWe had areas and we had congressional seats to\nIt's got to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states at the end up winning in a grand I'd like in a landslide\nAnd I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why\nFake news okay right behind you if you believe that the trade agreement will be a major issue in the mid term elections may look it's a good agreement that these people you know when I first did it they said oh why don't you just extend after they have no idea about\nBusiness just extend NAFTA\nThat would have been a disaster and we're losing a hundred billion dollars\nA year in deficits at least at least\nTo Mexico under NAFTA but just look at the results and and a substantial amount to Canada or do a lot of people try and say it's pretty much even it's not even we lose a substantial amount so you know I think it's a very hard thing to defend but that's all right look I understand the world the politics I think as well as anybody\nBut I haven't been doing it that long\nBut I actually have been 'cause I've been doing it on the other side and I do understand and you know they can take the greatest thing ever done\nAnd try and make it sound as bad as possible but this one stuff this one people are coming out for this one and saying\nThat's incredible what we've been able to do his behind you please [noise]\nThinking as surprised that it now that you've been hearing several questions on trade I'd like to ... don't have enough to do you have you have an excuse me\nDo have a question of trade will you know one or two more questions several questions don't do that that's not identify somebody just before ... excuse me don't do that do have a question on trade\nHe went through several quite you have a question on trade my question is on jacket and she has an FBI should interview whoever that they believe is appropriate says that include Julie sweat Nick that third accuser and can you promised to release the full and I was shy after they finished their report Mr President gave me a question plus [noise]\nThink so I think it's fine if they do I don't know that's up to them uh I think that he spoke very conclusively and very well I think it's been a very rough period of time I guarantee you never had a period of time like this\nWhen he was shows and everybody said oh this is going to go so quickly look people thought ten years ago that Brett Kavanaugh was going to be a Supreme Court justice because of his intellect because of his career\nBecause of the fact that there are no games you know now they talk about alcohol they talk about all of the\nThings that you hear and frankly you take a look at that they're bringing up subject we wouldn't know about this over the last\nTwenty years Thirty years of his career\nYou know what happened to go back to high school and they're saying he drank a lot on the evening and high school\nWe you know I tell you what I happen to know some United States senators\nWho is on the other side who's pretty aggressive I've seen that person in very bad situations\nI've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know uh\nI think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however\nWhat ever the senators want is okay with me they're going to be making a decision what ever they want is okay with\nMe go ahead by this crap that's enough to go this crap though for clarity sir say it you said this crap when you refer to I've been dealing with this crap for years what did you mean I\nI think that the press is treated me unbelievably unfairly\nFact when I Won I sent the good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse and worse now than ever their logo but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico\nNo no please sit down thinking though has ever go out and you're going to be next year and I didn't know I thought your ... go ahead\nI have two questions about judge Kavanaugh first there are now concerns that he may have lied or mischaracterized drinking while testifying if they find that he did do you think bars him from being here Supreme Court nominee\nI watch I watched him I was surprised at how\nA vocally was about the fact that he likes beer and he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this is not a man that said that alcohol was\nUp so that he was perfect with respect to alcohol or do I thought he was actually\nGoing back so many years I thought he was a excellent the interesting thing is though nobody asked them about what's happened\nHere's I thought he was a excellent the interesting thing is though nobody asked them about what's happened in the last twenty five thirty years during his professional career\nBecause I there are no bad reports I mean there have been reports\nOn everybody in here\nMost of the people sitting down there but except for my ... [laughter]\nWe find one on him that um I think that's that's going to be that'll be the greatest shock\nOf all [laughter] not that bad reports on everybody I'm looking at people I'm sort of\nLook at some of these people asking the questions okay look at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no for Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang province we call them\nDie ... Richard Da Nang that's his victim done a he never went to Vietnam\nAnd he's up there saying we need honesty and we need integrity this guy when he was the attorney general of Connecticut and he lied\nI don't mean a little bit and then when he got out he actually dropped out of the race or do you want anyway because Democrats are always went in Connecticut\nYou one very close probably the closest ever but he has a guideline and now he's up there talking like he's holier than thou you take a look at his record and when he got out and we apologize she was crying to tears were all over the place and now we acts like how dare you take a look\nAt the judge who has led an exemplary life I mean you're going back to high school\nBecause he had beer I think the judge has been a pretty amazing about describing his situation with alcohol and with beer\nLet me take a look at Cory Booker he ran Newark New Jersey into the ground\nHe was a horrible mayor and he made statements that when he was in high school or college what he was doing he actually made the statement and now he's talking about judge Kavanaugh and I could go through a whole list of ... looking Dianne Feinstein you're telling me about time\nDianne Feinstein knew about there's two months earlier if she wanted a a really thorough investigation when all the time in the world\nShe didn't have to wait until after the hearing was closed essentially\nShe should have said listen I have a problem I have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings we had two months no she didn't do that she waited until we were closed\nAnd then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say but you probably did based on a very bad body language you know the day but\nMore importantly under sense for her to have waited that period of time and now for you Democrats and I guess I'm including you to the media right I consider you what part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats to be talking about we want more time for the FBI if\nYou wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bring this up now you know is that you showed this the other Democrat she's not the only one she shared this other Democrats there were more than just heard that knew about this big confidential things confidential until the hearing was over after the hearing was over\nThey went public why didn't they do it during the hearing and we could have had all the time in the world you know why because they're dishonest people okay a yes or is this sort of surprised when\nYou hear my question Mr President says he did lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull his\nI don't think he did it look here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my only good traits I don't trust [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something good as I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess said they would I be as a would be the world's worst well but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man\nWith a drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him and many many years they go back to high school\nYou know I graduated from high school and and I I while I did not drink I saw a lot of people drink they drink beer and then go crazy and you know they were in high school that was sixteen Seventeen years old and I saw a lot of it\nDoes that mean that they can't do something that they want to do with their life so it's a very tough thing I I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot and so I don't know where there'd be big discrepancy okay go ahead please can you probably you know what you really had an ... you've had enough\nGo ahead please\nThank president on judge Kavanaugh said he was being targeted by Democrats have you made the process overly political and how can\nYou show a Mac and people that she'll be able to deliver impartial decision when you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you he's been treated horribly\nHe's a man with a family I think he's been treated horribly Lindsey Graham was I thought terrific the other day and he brought up one point that is now being discussed by a lot of people\nAnd that's who is going to want to run for office being office take an appointment of not just Supreme Court but you know many\nMany positions I have right now three hundred and sixty people that aren't being approved they're very qualified nobody says they're not qualified but Senator Schumer is not approving them because of resistant obstruct\nIt's much longer than ever and the history of our country like I think Doug all the time almost it's far more people than anybody in the history of our country most of those people are routine approvals these are people that gave up jobs they gave up their life to come and serve our country and Schumer and his group run\nThat slow walking down\nEverything is going to thirty hours meaning they take 'em out thirty hours person that's going to be a problem it's a disgrace so when the judge brings up whether it's politics or not I don't know you'd have to ask them but I can say this he's been treated really really horribly buddy you can go ahead and cleaner\nCome not concerned you know you know what I'm concerned that we get great great people on the U.S Supreme Court that's what I'm concerned and I want to have great people and I don't want to have to call people\nFor any court and have them say ... such a great honor but no thank you I just can't do I just can't do it it'd be a sad day for our country and we're gonna come close to that\nBecause I Know people now that say I don't know how he does it I don't know why he would have taken a nobody knew a thing like this could have happened [noise]\nCharging extra fees for major websites and preventing access\nTo certain

conservatives and the FCC chairman have also spoken out against net neutrality\nArguing it would do more harm than good favor a\nFree and open Internet as I think most consumers do my concern is where

tinder down to thirty second view point over seven percent gold dumped two tenths of one percent eleven eighty nine young ths crude oil up to point two percent Seventy four Ninety now four barrel WTY time Charlie fellow to that because the Bloomberg Business slash\nCharlie thank you well let's get back to the trade deal and Canada agreeing to sign onto this or renegotiate to deal with the U.S and Mexico are over the weekend for more on this we're joined now by Sarah McGregor she's our Bloomberg News economic policy team leader she's in our Bloomberg down the nine months studios in Washington and\nUs are a lot to unpack there from the president's press conference and then David westerns interview with commerce secretary Wilbur Ross they keep saying this is going to be a great deal for the U.S is it\n[noise] well I think yeah we've been through a bit of a world wind in the past ... forty eight hours or so since Friday in this deal ... there was a last minute push to get candidate into the deal and I think when when all of this was an ounce very late last night about eleven PM last night\nOr in in Washington there was just a relief from the business community from lawmakers that candidate was able to stay in the packed it looked pretty unlikely even on friday and and here we are now with a ... year old trade deals so I think that checked a box for everyone that uh you know at least we have Canada in here\nTrump didn't block then candidate didn't I'm sort of tried to talk longer and they were able to come up with something so I think that immediately races a bit of uncertainty for some businesses\nNow I think you know this is that it is a big document and people are starting to sort through the numbers and we're just really getting a handle on what this is going to mean for the business community\nSo talk about where the breakthroughs were for the U.S and Canada\n[noise] so I think you know over and above everything on the Trump Administration and we we heard Trump even today we really want to tell the autos feel more content gonna come from from the region to to be put into these cars\nPeople and and also the higher wage provision which means there's going to be more production essentially in in the U.S and and potentially Canada\nI think that's a big win for the Trump Administration they've always claim they want it to reduce the trade deficit the trade deficit for the U.S with Mexico it the lion's share of it is in auto production\nAnd also they talked about bringing jobs home so I think that it's just it's a big overall wind and it'll be a big part of their messaging when they ... this deal I'm also Kennedy gave a bit a\nBit of concessions on his dairy sector so that's going to protect us farmers in the Trump Administration will want to ... that on and on Canada side they they were able to keep the dispute panels some cultural uh protections that they that they had and so I think you know everyone has something to to brag about\nSoap does or analyst saying that the president does it deserves to take a victory lap here\nI don't know if anyone that you know ... gone that far certainly took one did take one and you know to to be fair this was one of his main campaign promises on during the twenty sixteen election was to revamp NAFTA and whether you know these are are just cosmetic changes that will actually make a difference is up for debate and different analyst will have\nA different views ... you know it it it can be said that Trump did follow through on this promise to to renegotiate this deal and and here he has it and this will be something to be able to waive around during the mid term elections and its ... Robert Lighthizer said it\nIs it and this will be something to be able to waive around during the mid term elections and its ... Robert Lighthizer said at the at the rose garden briefing the Trump today you know this all happened at warp speed and really in terms of trade agreements reached it did it was over fourteen months and and here we have a revamped NAFTA\nOr the original NAFTA took I think two or three years I remember I covered it um so what does the outlook for approval of the deal with the various legislatures and the three countries\nWell that is the key question in the U.S of course Trump said today he's he's going to sign up by the end of November which would give the sixty day window\nOn that he needs to leave between announcing the deal on Sunday and ... and signing it and then it goes to Congress for a yes or no vote and no one expects um even the Trump Administration Congress to even take a look at it took possibly march twenty Nineteen or later\nOf course Congress could look different after the elections in November the house might flip to the Democrats um so I think you know getting this actually pass will be another another big hurdle to pass today Trump can\nYou can tell that they've made the deal with the U.S and Mexico but again this all this is not the last we're going to hear about NAFTA\nAll right Sarah McGregor blooming and Bloomberg News economic policy team leader I'm going to get\nLet's get back to that stack of documents you got to plow through your desk\nOr coming up on Bloomberg Politics policy of power and law the Supreme Court starts a new term as uncertainty hangs over the Kavanaugh nomination but first let's get a check this world and national headlines would Bloomberg's ...\nWhich could be in a matter of a week or two or can be much longer than that\nAre they talking about delaying hearing any cases\nNot talking about it but so far in terms of the cases the court has agreed to hear um they they have not taken them most a high profile provocative cases so for example there's a a a pending bid for review and a case involving across\nThat is a World War one memorial and in the middle of a busy intersection in ah Maryland just outside the the the the border on in the courts so far have an acted on that\nPetition or they are potentially in this case waiting to see if they have another justice who might uh provide the deciding vote I'm speculating a bit here so but it it it seemed like there at least a kicking the can down the road on some of those more controversial cases but in terms of what they had a scheduled they're just going ahead as planned\nGot to ask you what is the mood around all of this in the building\nIt was interesting that argument today which is rather than an endangered species act was a fairly contentious\nUm it it it uh it right from the get go a justice Elena Kagan came out one of the liberal justice came out and was a pretty pretty forcefully arguing that\nAh the the endangered species that could be used to designate this this area as a critical habitat for an endangered fraud and just the fame Alito conservative I came right out\nAfter her and suggested that she was spinning the way the case was set up a to produce a preferred outcome so at least at this point it doesn't seem like on the bench the justices are pulling any punches\nYeah but but you know talked in the hallways about you know the Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the and the and the and the new FBI investigation going on this week\nYeah ... ... it's um you know my my sense is that uh there is going to be some division among a lot of people in this building over that um you know this is a very raw subject and it's crucially important for the the future of the court\nUm ... it you know it's it's there are two world that we we could have going forward we could have a court that\nI'm trying to lay low for a little while\nAnd not deal with these really controversial cases or you can have a world where it feels a little bit like an extension of that Senate hearing with with judge Kavanaugh there where the two sides are\nAre even more of a ... a hollering at one another and and at this point I Would say that the second possibility is at least possible\n[noise] and do you get a sense that that once this limited investigation by the FBI\nIs done that um\nBut let me just ask straight up to the cabinet still gets confirmed\n[laughter] here\nI have so much trouble recovered a lot of Nigerians Greg and I know I'm not trying to put you on the spot\n[laughter] you know I'm ... indications are that that does FBI investigation isn't going to tell us too much more than what we already know could be wrong and we'll see where it goes\nUm you know it it will then come down to basically what it is coming down to pretty much the whole time those few a Republican senators who votes are still up in the air it depends on what Susan Collins thinks about his testimony and she hasn't made that clear it it it it's\nUm I ... it's been clear that\nDepend on what it depends on what the FBI reports to\nA ... it's been clear that depend on what it depends on what the FBI reports to it it does depend on what the callers and some of the others yeah the one danger that that Brett Kavanaugh has\nThat maybe he didn't have a week ago um is that his testimony demeanor and the testimony was so combative that that could prompt from senators who say this was not\nThe kind of judicial person we want on the Supreme Court and there's also the ... the risk that if he is caught in some smaller life something other than you know the the the big sexual assault allegation if if there's\nEvidence that's clear enough that he\nMisrepresented the facts about his drinking or something else that uh you know the the references and yearbooks for that that might be enough of a reason for somebody to say I don't trust this guy he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court but you know this all depends on what's in the mind of two or three a federal senators\nAnd just unless the forty five seconds what did you make of President Trump's comments about all this in the rose garden today\nYou know Peter I've been I'm afraid I been upstairs and you've been working on a story about the endangered species act and so I'm gonna have to talk on that 'cause I haven't heard what is it fair to say about that\nGreg do problem was that they are the thanks and we know you'll be spent on you'll you'll be doing your job and we'll we'll talk to you know which way up there just a moment about the White House comments but the uh thank you once again the ... and thanks for keeping us up to speed a grocery store Bloomberg

week I felt like last week the focus was all on Washington between the fed a and I would say here in New York we had the UN but also switch very quickly back\nA wash your time rather than out in right and now they're kind of like forgotten and rather have an obviously the ongoing FBI investigation but today the headlines really dominated by\nGE first of all a John ... losing his job after only fourteen months we have not seen that speedy of an exit certainly at that\nType of comedy in that size of company you know outside of someone really doing something bad this is purely performance related as much as I can tell the\nStory that we talked about this being the most boring market ever like just talking also about how news goes through companies and things get dealt with rather quickly and because of social media whether it's activist investors are selling and stuff like that people are you know what I mean if there's issues out there and they're out there and they kind of get that ... sometimes and more quickly\nAnd and the issues around Tesla which seemed to really becoming too ahead late in the week with you on ... century rejecting a deal from the SEC\nSought better that over the weekend and I came to a conclusion brunch and said you know ... maybe cooler heads prevail they're All right let's\nFind out what it all means uh\nDave Wilson is back with us we missed him last week he was obviously rooting the jaguars on to victory\nOr he gave me a little ... there are stocks that are of course for Bloomberg here now Bloomberg interact or burger studio job wise and told markets editor and co host of what you miss all say lung side is yeah one thing when it does is many things why\nThose tests and General Electric shares our values big time so investors are saying All right you did something that we dealt with that we can move on but\nSo is that the let's open ended up to the gentleman here so Dave is that what people are expecting at this point it's quicker action and investors then reward them what what do you make of this\nWell in that they are connected to issue here there is in the sense that you know people wanna see\nContinuity in the case of Tesla and changes in the case of gee\nSo you know there there is a bit of a departure but they want you know management to have a firmer hand on the company whatever that taste what's not forget the risk was with Tesla that\nYou must might lose his CEO position as well as his chairman's role and as it turned out is just going to have to go without the chairman title for at least three years and paid twenty million dollars which maybe\nMeans you finally get kind of an adult in the room provided that board change as right 'cause this is what are some folks have been saying that you need a board that's not just any lines relatives to end or friends\nThat exactly and then the case of gee it's\nMore something has to happen\nThey brought in Larry Cole who made a lot of things happened to Dan or her which was a fairly similar companies are gee in terms of the breadth of its business so\nYou know you have some confidence there I should point out though jeez been giving back some of its initial gauges slows of the day itself but now almost eight percent but it had been up a lot more earlier that was hanging on what's advanced it's up more than sixteen percent\nAnd that's what you eat whatever they can come on and on\nA it is pretty uh you know I Will say this when I saw they also took that big right down\nOn G with the news media events like the dream thing for a new ratio to get to do something or twenty three billion committed to a company and my advice to anyone here have you ever see the first day you get to take a twenty three billion dollar right down to it you're setting the bar so low at the points that really is\nA a a very good to search for him already not to mention of course they are the stock or\nI Believe the phrase is a big bath yeah ... is that what they call it yeah when you get a change in\nManagement and they decide to take everything out that they want and then the results down the line look better and everybody says oh great job except they kind of forget in some cases where it took to get there\nRight so what else are you all talking about on the desk or over across the way here at Bloomberg\nI had a string for jazz short interest in high ... percent necessary to show me because I was actually going to say something very smart an off the beaten path but once again I'm going to guide the lead guy and all and they are you at all in favor of smart take it away\nNo ... no one's talking about this but\nTurkey has seen a very rarely rarely and the lira no out earlier is below sea and stuff like Fifteen Percent and there was some data today than shows that the trade balance for turkey is improving very rapidly\nSo um the uh the the ... the trade deficit has its lowest since the crisis which makes sense because when your currency gets weaker that's good for exports and also they can't buy as much from the outside right so we're seeing that rebalancing that needs to happen stole during the midst of very intense or economic slowdown\nBut we haven't been talking about turkey nearly as much as ... as we were a back in August with it all we were talking and I think it's worth giving them a little credit for the rebound that they were saying and not ignoring how much of a comeback there is at least on the ... okay we'd\nUh yeah all the stocks are up again but there's a lot of short and that kind of about it\nUh I had a really interesting conversation today with someone who is or who knows the Canadian weeds pays very well and I'm not going to give it away because we're gonna have them on the ... and then I'll talk about it okay but it's a fast\nThe teeth yeah he he's there was so I like it or anything else on your radar screen Mr Wilson\nWell I'd put out a short on social media earlier since I wasn't here last week 'cause y'all mentioned today why don't cheat but I I decided to throw one out there and read about it is kind of a catch a chart Sears Holdings going independent stock status\nHappened at the end of last week it's falling further today it's down to about eighty three cents it's below a hundred million dollars in market value and just you know the Trump just kinda chronicles the performance of the shares\nEver since this company was created back in two thousand five through the combination of stairs and kmart's under the hedge fund manager Eddie land\nFor the homeless tree is an elaborate alright the electorate they Wilson you'll be back with us later on in the show with your stock of the day Joe ... markets editor for Bloomberg headed off to television and what you missed coming up at four pm Sanford the bite of the day care\nIt is indeed one number that tells us a lot of planes number twenty four percent acquaintance steady by ... nearly a quarter

devices like Amazon Echo Google speaker apples home pot\nHave taken off in recent years with Nielsen noting that sixty two percent of smart speaker owners have purchased their devices and just the past six months allow forty five percent of smart speaker owners are planning to purchase more devices but I'm I'm kinda like and\nI Do too I I really like it I rely on it a lot more than I that certainly ... fell a little bit gimmicky when we got it All right no gimmicks down in Washington with Martin to care oh he's got some world national headlines say Martin\nThank you so much the new NAFTA has a new name us MCA the U.S Mexico Canada agreement at a White House news conference today already right here on Bloomberg Radio the president touted the fulfillment of one of his campaign promises to obtain new trade deals\nGuidance number that he gave it to November investor day it was supposed to be the big unveiling of his strategy and instead it was something of a flaw and then he stopped\nBy those numbers even as it became pretty obvious to anybody who followed the company that it was extremely unrealistic that he was actually going to meet that goal\nSo Jim come on in here and I want you to pick up if you can't on on what broke was saying how much of this is a fundamental problem and how much of this was a messaging problem for ...\nBoth because he came in his job was to fix the border to do that yeah the first diagnosed problem to his credit he was much more forthright with our investors\nAbout the issues that you would prefer that ended up being the new throughout his because he came out with them after better about their bed item investors heard it for the last debate because the board of directors because there was no turn around there was just more and more bad news\nSo can you know gee it's always been a very complicated company and I feel like\nSince Jess not ... in a sense jak wells that very CEOs have been trying to uncover implicate the company if you will um power aviation healthcare oil and gas those are the businesses um that it's in right now I'm Jim are those are right businesses for GE to be in and and again is this just a company that\nIs dealing with a mess that CEO after ... keeps inheriting\nThat I Do think they are in the right businesses obviously the power of businesses the biggest problem right now it's being hurt by huge downturn and demand\nOf the company had over for ... for to the to about three times what the ... actually is for sure that's for sure to get through this but they do have great asset from charities D'Leisha and oil and gas although they're looking to split off her shoes\nBut ah to it at the end of the day the purpose of ... ... ... one of the ups and downs turned ... her with those leading businesses\nSo broke I it's interesting you've been following this one so closely to the point where I Would be coming off the TV set in the morning talk about whatever while she was talking about you'd be coming on almost inevitably the over the next nine months ago when I was like every day every day every day\nYou've already written a couple columns about this today one of which points out points out in this day of corporate governance that we're talking about that gee maybe missed an opportunity here tell us about that\nShirt so what I meant by that is they named Larry Colton is the former CEO Dan herd not only a CEO but also as chairman which just struck me as a really curious move because there was a fair amount of pushback when John ... was both EEO and chairman it was an issue raised in ... a annual meeting as it has been from the last\nNumber of years I got a little bit more investors support this time around I at that backs that proposal and it seemed at the time like a step in gene you should really take if it's serious about holding its management team accountable serious about really turning over a new leaf sending\nThe right message and it didn't do that and then again it failed to do that today which seems like an oversight to me um you know I think Larry called as a very qualified executive he had a very lucrative\nSuccessful career and Dana from the from the business that he ran at dinner was very different from what he will have to do a G eat dinner her was a good company when he started and so his task was to build it up into an even better companies and he's in I'm In a accident he buys companies he makes them more valuable by putting them into Dana hers\nOperating system GE is not going to be doing ... anytime soon and needs to manage its credit rating for one thing on and you know it's in the process of the best thing a number of businesses including healthcare including Baker Hughes energy athletes I mean it's just a very different\nSkills that than what he had to use before nothing you can't do it but why not bringing a chairman that might be able to help and provide some fresh additional perspective Tim what's your thoughts on what book just had to say\nThat we do tend to favor companies to have an independent the chairman and separate from from the studio but nothing to do was to cope with coming in with a lot of credibility with a great track record it to her like she said\nBut also a lot of the bad news has been clear for cleared garden has been lowered they're going to miss garden for the year they're going to be careful numbers for the year the writers and could you could come in now and not be the victim of this bad news would be able to get out of it and hopefully come first\nAnd then now and
