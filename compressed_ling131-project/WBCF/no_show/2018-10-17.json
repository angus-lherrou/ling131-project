eight nine four one\nPackage Joe ... let me go to line one freeze your your patients Andrew what's going on\nHow to work on for taking my call and welcome honored and type ... thank you I I ... I wanted to make a comment on a couple of things\nTo think mainly first I just wanted to mention the fact that if if if Payton where ... where I live in a while and I believe the end even make something like Obama vaccine charming\nHave a silver con and he when he he'd be able to lie very convincingly that play called the prank life I'm OK hasn't looked like somebody that was rough so that that was my first thought that I think\nI just wanted to really quickly um contractor reaction to rather than have called um you know drunken super races cat\nYeah and and the outrage he faced birthdays President Obama's response Trayvon Martin trial and I honestly feel like kids respond and his support for\nThe wrong side he had blood on his hands and where it encouraged and propped up\nA riot and I wouldn't even think that black lives matter and and yet here he is Harold data hero and you know Roseanne Barr we never see a loud mouth yeah team you know and one key thing that the national anthem I mean she didn't lose their job and that was\nFor me incredibly ...\nWas it was like oh she's having it horribly was getting booted and then ... yeah so this is Roseanne it is but you're right you say one thing about Valerie Jarrett who has a connection to Obama in this day and age are in big trouble\nYeah exactly I I just felt like and such and such hypocrisy you know that that's the current moral outrage at at a at a comedian fame something and cry that the attack birthdays President Obama's broadcast word or that we're you know extremely device as\nI Do want to do in the correct a couple of ... it wasn't a text it wasn't in private it was a tweet\nThat she did publicly every around I saw you write a book but I Do want to agree with you on Obama not only with Trayvon Martin but also with Michael Brown and also with was a skip what's his face the the the guy from Cambridge when there was a young and on right when there was an issue I'm In this country between police officers\nAnd or or somebody like this guy was not a police officer but this community watch guy if the person appear to be white German was when he was just panic but they keep on calling him a lot of white Hispanic\nIf the person was white and the other person was black Obama knee jerk react to every single time supported the black side even though Trayvon Martin went back and forth a guy that's why I ended up dead even though\nOf Michael Brown walked into the convenience store and beat up the owner and and stole something and was high on drugs and attacked a police officer and his cruiser that didn't matter they they took the side of of Michael Brown in fact the since ... people from the White House to his funeral\nAnd what a shame to skip what's history Skip Gates in Cambridge the guy was breaking into his own house and the police officers stopped and said hey just proved to be that this is your house and for some reason the cop was racist according to Obama and according to Skip Gates so you're right every single time he had the opportunity Obama always took the side\nOf the black person or the minority all over the majority or the white person or the white establishment that's what people would call the police\nBecause even if you're black and you're a cop\nBlack lives matter which say you're not black you're blue\nAnd they put you to different classification so she's right about that I I'm not going to agree that Satan would look like President Obama\nAlthough I Do agree that that said there's not going to show up and have horns in flames coming out of his face or it will be it will be somebody that we wouldn't otherwise no running called him Satan that doesn't make sense to me I Do appreciate was an injury I appreciate your very very much of the IRS the challenge of got Jeff in Rhode Island ... no time at all\nAnd and I'm I'm going to give it to you but I've got like forty five seconds before the break and you make it up and\nI can do a thing I'll tell you this right up that a number one a truck was the guy that nobody expected to win right hand or are we all expected to lose but he came through and he was the businessman that nobody expected because he was not a politician who is a businessman\nTo I Want to make a little shout out to my uh my my uh veterans friends\nI'm a veteran a Cold War veteran of the twenty six Yankee Infantry Division one twenty six signal battalion and number three quickly a core very quickly uh um\nThe other thing I wanted to say was that uh uh the term Pocahontas is incorrect it's so cautious F. A. U. X. caught this term by a local New England guy call we car\nNice we love it we love how we how he's a great guy yeah of folk on his focus either way we will talk about that with Jeff deal he's up next season Republican taking on Elizabeth Warren\nOr that basically said that she was a ... a directory this for lawyers that college is that when a higher and look at you know\nWhen she got to University of Pennsylvania she insisted she be listed as Native American but when she got to Harvard and got that job she demus yourself\nFrom that national directory as Native American so clearly when she was done using that it was a ... not important do anymore and she never went to any Native American events on campus or the fact is she's never apologize for that the issue has been bothering people for a long time but Jones is the one who ended up yesterday opening Pandora's box and talking about it\nWell I'm with you this was going to go away I mean the president calling her Pocahontas makes it look like ... she's the victim she complained about card the fact that she did a DNA test\nAnd put the results out there that proves that you and I are more Native American and she is and I'm not at all\nThat just doesn't make any sense she actually she looked through your softball or through the president of softball or do you think that she really thought going in because she's not stupid do you think that she thought going into this was going to be the victory for whoever Trump and possibly that gets ruined the national stage to be the nominee in twenty twenty\nOne and a couple of things going I think she knew she had to try to put the issue aside somehow if she's going to run she met in twenty twenty and\nAnd during the Kavanaugh hearings she was so desperate to make the national scene that she doctored video and did a fundraising letter off of that she also did another fundraising letter off the uncorroborated\nOr testimony of Dr for all of this basically to try to make her name out in the national headlines at a time when she's competing with Kamala Harris and of course a center of Spartacus yeah I mean that's what the oil is for her to try to beat the far left progressive nominee for a two thousand and twenty and again in Massachusetts I\nFirst of all she's miss meeting us for a long time you know she was on meet the press saying that she has no intention of running for president Joan yet said that many times and then all of a sudden she says I'm going to take a hard look at it we found out with the Washington Post story just this last weekend that basically she's been spending a lot of money half a million dollars on candidates\nAround the country raising over seven million dollars for candidates I she's of course then to Ohio recently as stumped for their candidate for governor ... in Pennsylvania in Oklahoma a few weekends ago while I was up in Lawrence dealing with people with the gas line explosions here in our state so she's been spending a considerable amount of time uh\nBasically working on that presidential run and now I think people in Massachusetts are fully aware she has no intention of working for them show or spend the next two years if she's reelected\nTraveling around the country a delivery nothing for us\nWhich is actually also admitted that she she would not commit to uh to to living out her term if he wins again she sort of I I Can't promise that all stayed with senator for the next six years which is something that you will promise right\nExactly you know the messages that had some issues whether it's health care the fishing industry the opioid crisis or things I've been working on things I Know I can continue to work on a whereas she has been MIA and I think I'm\nRight now it's really interesting there's a move afoot in this state to try to get Deval Patrick Kennedy he's the former governor of Massachusetts\nHas become a candidate for a running and twenty twenty so it's interesting even the Democrats in Massachusetts seem to be trying to crowd her out of this field because I think it's clear at this point\nShe really can't avoid stepping in it anytime she is on the national stage whether it's calling law enforcement and criminal justice system racist whether it's saying that anybody who voted for Trump as part of a stew of racist I mean she really just has that same negative tone that Hillary Clinton had as well\nYeah I agree totally it's Jeff deal he's a Republican running against a was with Warren ... percent of you know in Massachusetts but you run a ... and that's it's a pretty good place to go because the Republicans were looking like it might be a bad November\nOr do the blue wave whatever that is it makes me a bit of a ... but anyway uh the blue wave allegedly was gonna give them a house back the Senate was going to be very close might even give them the Senate now it looks like\nThey might gain three or four seats including you um ... just how common are even those who are center center center left to live in Massachusetts do not like with the left just did in that hearing are you finding that to be the case are you feeling this the impact of Kavanaugh on on your ... to see or know\nYeah there's a lot of people in Massachusetts that feel that he was railroaded I'm the father of two daughters so of course I Want them to be listening to if something happened but the fact is there was no corroborated evidence\nWith a a basically an eleventh hour smear attend a Dianne Feinstein her the senator or the ranking member of the judiciary could have had that uh those allegations investigated in private six weeks earlier she didn't she chose to drop it like a bombshell too embarrassed if a man and she ended up ruining two lives um the accuser any accused and then the process made\nThe Senate look extremely bad and I think that people are so sick and tired of Washington looking dysfunctional and they know that Warren is basically the tip of that dysfunctional spear um again because she takes such awful actions about going out there and basically saying presumption of innocence the cornerstone of our democracy that means nothing if you want to just\nMake sure that Republicans don't get their nominee for the Supreme Court ah that partisanship doesn't work even in Massachusetts and I I was saying this Joe\nYou know we are the state where Ted Kennedy used to hold the same seat and even though he was the liberal lion of the Senate he wouldn't work with Republican presidents and Republican governors to deliver for our state people are sick and tired of war and not delivering and then becoming a national embarrassment as well\nWell I Wonder if Massachusetts is ready for somebody who's not for overwhelming regulation overwhelming grace of of government overwhelming taxation because to me when I figured Elizabeth Warren other than the Pocahontas stuff the thing that comes to mind is she's basically your socialist she's basically\nThan the Pocahontas stuff the thing that comes to mind is she's basically a socialist she's basically far leftist that says if we\nControl everything we're the smart people they knew people will have a better life I don't want her to control me is that really what it is it's sort of the the guy who believes in independence liberty and freedom against the person who believes that she's the smartest person in the room\nWhere I look I'm an Eagle Scout I always thought you had any like campground better than you found it I ran for office in Egypt forty and now that you're running for the Senate never thought I'd be doing this but it's something I think is calling it's not supposed to be a career and I'll tell you with Elizabeth Warren\nWarren wanting to nationalize business having government determine what your board of directors composition shouldn't be that one step towards Venezuela and look at what's going on right there she wants health care to be run\nBy government and if you know if you like having a you know dialysis six months after you need it or like England has sure go to that socialist healthcare already like having hip replacements after five years\nGo to Canada but if you like having the United states where we actually get procedures done in a timely manner you know we shouldn't have government running our health care and so you know one cannot have government run our lives enough in fact she wants to access to the point where\nI think on CNBC she said fifty percent would be the starting point up too and we don't know the ceiling I guess the the host at Ninety percent might be too much and she agreed somewhere between fifty percent Ninety percent uninsured or take a your income Joe\n... doesn't make any sense artist Jeff deal he's a

who who warships them where is this cold and how to how do we get out of it good evening to jog\nWell well John I think economists worship central banks central banks employ a lot of them and economists are the source of information\nBanks be central banks employ a lot of them and economists are the source of information for reporters who are trying to create a narrative about what's happening in the markets and the economy\nPlus remember just as an example economists almost to a man and woman thing that all the maiming killing and wealth destruction that was World War two had an upside called economic growth and so it's based on bad information but we're supposed to believe that the Fed's\nInterest rate hiking its its attempts to hike the short rate of credit which is really all of this as a target\nHas somehow out of nowhere spook markets will such a view isn't serious not only is the fed and not a rate set or the fed is a rape follow where the fed follows markets and moves up its rate based on what the markets are doing but we have to remember\nInvestors have known for at least a year to the fed was going to do what it's doing so the idea that investors would just now be reacting to what's been known for quite some time isn't serious\nThe markets story is not a fed story but that's the story that the media like to promote because that's what economists tell them is the story\nThe Federal Reserve sets a target rage uh for the best lenders we're told John that the best lenders that would be the banks too big to fail even bigger\nAre having a very good quarter and they've had a very good year and all the other indices and indicate that corporations are making a lot of money the profits are very strong that the U.S economy is very strong\n[noise] absolutely [noise] twenty four hours and then you don't have to come up I mean\nThree two three four of them are going to get credit for the HAMP dot com\n\n\n\nI'm John ... or this is the John ... of this segment of the global business report to you by the Republican passive I shot from food energy to acknowledge it kind of\nThe republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in the region well worth exploring I welcome Josh broken\nRiding global opinion\nFor the Washington Post and we start not with the mystery of the missing perhaps murdered\nA journalist for the Washington Post in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul we start with the number one hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales to Saudi Arabia announced claimed asserted by the Trump Administration that is part of the mystery of cuts choking\nJosh I'm very good evening to you one hundred and ten billion dollars\nSizeable and the president was commenting on it most recently in his interview with sixty minutes this hundred and ten billion dollars is a guaranteed is Congress part of this conversation about Saudi Arabia are arms sales are GDP our jobs and the murder of a journalist good evening to\nWell good evening John the issue of us arms sales to Saudi Arabia is back in the news\nBecause members of Congress in both parties in both chambers have are looking for ways to exert pressure on the Saudi regime to give up information about the parents of ... and uh this is the thing that they think that they can use to\nUm at at least\nTry to convince the Saudis to reveal what they know and uh participate in the investigation and the way that sheds light on his disappearance now going on over two weeks and\nOf course when President Trump was asked about this immediately said no no no we can't\nDo that you know his excuse is resist where that it would affect us jobs and that I Saudi Arabia might turn to us rivals like Russia and China are but it's also important to note that President Trump\nLikes these arms sales because he helps them as a major achievement in the U.S Saudi Arabia relationship that he attributes themselves are mostly because when he went to rely on his first ever trip abroad last year\nThe this is what the big announcement was this was the big deliver this is what he says the itchy now if you look at it than a hundred and ten billion dollars is grossly exaggerated some of it it feels that have been in the pipeline to the bottom industry some invade our aspirational deals that may or may not ever materialize and then there's a small subset of that\nWhere those deals are actually moving but\nThose deals that are actually building are now in limbo because they have to go through a congressional\nProcess to and there's no way that in this current environment without some sort of resolution to the question of the Saudi regimes Rowland is the most parents that Congress is going to let this happen now but I argue today in the Washington Post very simple as that you know whether or not you believe that our arms sales to Saudi Arabia represents\nYou know whether or not you believe that our arms sales to Saudi Arabia represents leverage that we could use to pressure them what President Trump is done by taking it off the table by saying that actually know this is something that we need from the study is he's completely reverse that dynamic he's turned it into Saudi leverage on us\nFor no particular reason that I can see you and you know what that's done is sort of now ... states in a position where any country\nWho is selling us arms as it easy get out of jail free card whenever they run afoul of something that we believe violates our\nNorms are rights or you know the rights of our citizens and residents and weak as it is a but it could have far reaching effects and uh it definitely doesn't help sixer Mike Pompeo is in Riyadh trying to get the Saudis to play ball and back here in Washington President Trump is just taking quiver arrows out of his quiver\nDisappears a genuine geostrategic paradox Josh I mention that staying with Riad we also have to deal with Iran\nWe also have to deal with Ankara and then there was the Gulf Cooperation council so there are cross purposes in all directions as we go forward I cheat on the hundred and ten billion dollars of arms sales because that is a way of supporting what is our all ally in the contest with a wrong\nAnd I'm puzzled by Congress and that contest putting pressure on Saudi Arabia doesn't that boost Tehran isn't that also a factor here in addition to the money\nWell you're right there's no doubt that a a U.S Saudi diplomatic flare up undermines is trumping ministry ages main\nDiplomatic initiative right now which is to coalesce coalition supports pushback against Iran's malign influence cut off around in oil which depends on the Saudis pumping more oil and given that we're not working with the Europeans on this really you know the Gulf fees are the ones that are going to have to\nTeam up with us this Iran strategy that Trump is already announced it already done is is ... it has any chance of being an success so yes it's a pickle you know there is no clear way out of this for the Trump Administration lurch tactic right now seems to be a bit\nTo try to avoid you coming to this point where they have to make a decision whether or not to punish the Saudis if and when we actually discovered that they did this thing to me that they have this thing um it undermines Trump's administration's plans to roll out of a Middle East peace plan because that Middle East peace plan is\nBased according to the White House on getting Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf countries to throw in it also undermines the effort that Jared Kushner always talks about to build the middle east security lines an Arab NATO out the critics they made attrition will say that all of these policies were destined to fail your\nAnyway the Palestinians are not going to come to the table while the Trump restrictions punishing them there's very little chance Iran is going to come back to the table negotiate a deal and Saudi Arabia itself blew up the idea so to speak their choice of words\nOf having a Middle East\nNATO when they started embargo against Qatar so you know if you believe that there was a reasonable chance ... ministers are pulling off this Patrick I'm really complicated difficult\nPolicies the middle east you have to see that this crisis hurts their ability to do all sorts of things that you can understand why the White House is resisting dealing with his head on\nJosh it's possible we been on this road for some time and the reports from Yemen about the indiscriminate bombing and the aggression by these the by the surrogates for Saudi Arabia for Riyadh\nHave been have had trouble with Congress for a long time and it looks like that's all now galvanized with the murder of the\nJournalists but it isn't it isn't an isolated complain about Saudi Arabia\nRight and you know there's no doubt that there are some a lot of people who already had issues with the with Saudi relationship we are now taking the opportunity of this crisis to push forward an agenda they are the worst namely to break up the U.S Saudi alliance in that but when you add that to the people who are genuinely\nConcerned about the disappearance of tomorrow which are a lot of people that begins to\nCreate a momentum that could actually have the effect of changing me when I started really we don't know\nHow it's all going to turn out or you know it's sort of Americans generally gives the government a pass to do things or national security that have collateral damage and you know that doesn't really affect American Soldiers right so if the Saudis are killing a lot of\nInnocent people in Yemen you know there there's not a big likelihood that your your average American therefore average congressman is going to raise a big stink outta that but when something like this happening why can sometimes have the effect of wrong the public's attention to our allies Saudi Arabia and the ... just practice is on a range of friends\nIn a unique way crystallize is it for people okay and this is kind of ... when the relationships change and when you know a a a small movement in Congress to stop the U.S aid to Saudi Arabia and Yemen War to really gained momentum and I think that's what you're saying happening right now\n... for the Washington Post time John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\n[noise]\n\nGo love condemnation ... Fox News President Trump warning of a rush to judgment when it comes to the disappearance of journalist you mall 'cause she'll be at the Saudi constantly didn't stand bonus evidence now that the Saudis had something to do with it\nIs official symbols are disclosed details of gruesome operation involving interrogation taught to end up voting so they say Saudi agent killed Jamal to show me

in effect the day to day lead to the conference told the secretary we are strong and old allies we face challenges together the ... the day of tomorrow\nAnd if you were to improve the management the public lands for example would make a much greater difference and the severity of forest fires than trying to do anything for global warming\nOf the contrast between fires on private lands which are very low and on public managed lands are very very great if you look at the aggregate I I went back and check some of these now as far as far as it down globally about Seventy or eighty percent from what they were around Nineteen hundred it's a striking decline that is going on\nAnd so is every you don't want to look at a dramatic incident that day but you have to do is to get aggregate data and the aggregate data doesn't support the claim\nThat the fire system is going out of control and to the extent that there are changes the thought that somehow they would want to change the entire economy\nInstead of figuring out how to manage far worse than a more sensible fashion is\nWildly over broad you're looking at the wrong thing there are no solutions that would work better even way you build houses the kind of clear as you do and so forth there\nAre many many things that could be done to deal with fires without having to have the kinds of transformation that the PC is talking\nAbout hurricanes so or a psych loans the allegation is made that they will deepen and increase in severity and striking the land you provide a chart in your defining ideas base\nThat suggests we're not looking at increased since we're looking at cycles and this goes back to Nineteen Seventy I'm going to guess that if we go back even farther anecdotally will see the same cycle\nYes generally speaking of the day that gets a little bit spot here's who go earlier but it's the same thing and they were huge hurricanes in Nineteen forty five I still remember living through hurricane hazel in Nineteen fifty for not attributing it's a global warming the worst storm ever to hit mainland United States is still the Galveston\nHurricane of Nineteen thirty of Nineteen hundred oh there are pictures of Houston being flooded in twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen they're also pictures of Houston being flooded in Nineteen thirty five and they're essentially the same kind of picture\nThe cyclical phenomena are pretty much uniform with respect to everything that we look at and and the basic problem the global warming theorists is if in fact you have all these things going up and down up and down\nYou can't explain the ups and downs by a movement in carbon dioxide levels which has been consistently but gradually put over very long period of time\nThey've got to get other forces to explain what's going on when Richard Lewis and gave his lecture in England but he said it's you know a bunch of other forces like water vapors for example that could be doing it and there are other things that are local which do this so if you're trying to figure out the way in which the system works\nIt's a terrible mistake to assume that the only independent very ... you have any source or significance\nCarbon dioxide\nVariable is temperature or what happens is there is a law known as the rainiest is law which says that given certain sensitivity assumptions\nAs carbon dioxide changes you take the lord with them to the base to the base the um it means that you're going to get a slower than linear increase and the amount of carbon dioxide but that's everything else being equal but the moment you realized that water vapor is probably the more powerful greenhouse gas\nAnything you do to change what's happening to carbon dioxide may be able to fix a fifth of the problem but it's not going to touch the other eighty percent of that particular problem so the return from investments are going to be lower and you don't see anything whatsoever the eyepiece is the\nStudies that I've looked at which kind of try to do an intelligent of cost benefit analysis of where we go my own view on this stuff is a ... you can basically have orderly technological progress\nOf based upon other kinds of considerations in the end if you reduce the amount of pollution if in the end you managed to increase the overall efficiencies of all the legal or the business infrastructure systems we have

really going to vary ate the Russians are but we're going to do this because you crave aids to practice it's doesn't claims that we gave them\nDid Trump authorize it didn't even know about it I mean I think we've gotten to that point\nWhere we can ask the question now people will say vast conspiracy thinking but I revert to history we know pretty well that the CIA aborted Eisenhower's summit meeting with Chris Johnson Nineteen sixty with the EU to flight so there's precedent for\nThis and how we know and drop off as ... as premier of the Soviet Union took the U.S and the Soviet Union to the brink of launching missiles Steve that's where they were in late eighty three and drop off died in early sixties ... and early eighty four and that's when Gorbachev becomes premier in\nThe back and I was like not just talking about that though everything you say is true you got your dates a little off but it doesn't matter the periods correct it seems to have been that close call able archer or the perception\nOn Reagan's ... he was then president that his very hard line rhetoric Cold War rhetoric\nActually could lead to a nuclear war he never thought that was possible Reagan hated the idea of you know and that's what began to turn Reagan as he would later say to wait for a Soviet leader ready to do big time any Cold War they taught with\nReagan later complain when he asked why it took so long and he's right Soviet leaders kept dying on because after ... have died in eighty to ... uh I'm drunk or who you've talked about becomes leader\nAnd died in eighty five I had the uh with all the year thank you Steve he by\n... the the the point is and drop of already was suffering kitten leafing right he was on dialysis I Know about dialysis my mother had kittens it's three days a week on dialysis you can't be a leader on dialysis that's probably why be under Soviet leaders want any they knew he couldn't\nBecome a strong leader and then he was succeeded by a leader Chang is jarring already has emphysema\nRight and then when Margaret Thatcher misty when Margaret Thatcher met him at end drop a funeral this is an anecdote I Love she dressed all in black this is Al Gore day after the surging he said to act very sober and respectful and you'll get something she ... she said my goodness I haven't got anybody who's out of a ...\nAnd ... that killed he was that ill in February of sixty four eighty four when she met him\nMore than that he was literally living in a hospital doing his business as the new general secretary and I think he lasted\nThirteen months I mean we're we we divert from the story but it's worth reminding ourselves that at that moment I studied this very carefully that in the early eighties after the death of Russian of in Nineteen\nEighty two right the Soviet leadership did not want a strong leader they were becoming geriatric they didn't want a vigorous leader who would replace them so they kept choosing literally dying that and Gorbachev\nAt fifty three and row lost\nOne of them said when it was clear that they couldn't stop Gorbachev he is criminally young criminal you're young they were already approaching Haiti so we divert from the story of that but it raises the it also points to another moment\nWhen intelligence agencies can have exceedingly important political influence at the top and that is when there's opposition to the leader and the leader is weak weak physically or I Would submit to you we politically as Trump is today\nBecause this cloud of suspicion hangs over him and also because he hasn't quite gotten the hang of how to exercise power in Washington\nBut there are large opening\nFor quote rogue\nOperations by intelligence today and I think we're seeing\n... even when I Want to do some dates here because I Want to mention the coach cough a rogue operation of Ninety One a drop of brush left us in eighty two\nUh and drop off guys in February of eighty four ... and last till the spring of eighty five when Gorbachev takes over but Gorbachev has to deal with ... head of the KGB\nUntil eighty eight and then crutch cough who was first chief direct right these are the master\nParanoid agents of the country much more powerful when you have a weak leader at the head of the uh the Soviet and its perch cough who launches the coup\nAgainst against Gorbachev so it's not conspiracy mongering Steve we're just reporting the facts of the first Cold War\nAnd since I Can't find any difference between the first Cold War and the second Gulf War right now and admittedly I'm soaked in bend mcentire and guards or guard ... so perhaps I'll lighten up a ... I Can't remove the\nPossibility that those same intelligence services FSB there and CIA here or FBI around my five around my six are not ambitions in similar fashion if they think the country has lost the argument against the opponent\nAnd that raises the question for the rest of us\nOff I don't know that we can say that intelligence services in Russia in the u._k. in the United states and Saudi Arabia\nElsewhere are playing a bigger role than they ever played in history before I Would say that I don't know enough but I Would say that they're it's clear you and I now agree that they are playing a very big role today\nThey are not a constitutional branch of our government was so therefore it raises the question how do we feel about this\nShould something be done about this remember I I think you'll remember but I'll bet you and not many listeners remember that in Nineteen Seventy five in the Senate there was the famous bipartisan church committee investigation\nThe CIA operations uh it published a five or six fire them report in\nNineteen Seventy six it was for a bipartisan that is in the mid seventies concern about what the CIA was doing it becomes so great that the two political parties including conservative Republicans\nDid a major investigation and it was a sensation at the time and it was documented at the CIA was running rogue operations they we're assassinating people they were attacking our telephones in home and reform for an act\nSo called trick reforms in Seventy five and Seventy six meant to prevent this from ever happening again they didn't work and property we need a new church committee but we will never get one today\nBecause of Russia gay and because of the Democrats would never joined the Republicans it has to be bipartisan in the Senate but we're dealing with a political reality\nThat's been part of our lives for decades and now is being framed by these new events ah that's and and I want it before we know\nWhy these neurons are that's and and I want it before we\nKnow what I go I didn't want to go to the elite operation Steve I we have we have one other subjects we need to deal with professor Conan are having much too much fun\nTo protect your nose as it just said joy the Cold War game to spy versus spy I mean who needs in Fleming we've got the real thing Steve Cohen professor at NYU and ... and at Princeton University I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

[noise] ... [noise]\n\nFrom the back of the jungle have showed one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss\nCo written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just do what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until a killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\n[noise] sure hum after Iraq killing Patton which became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover biggest pat and\nUh was an occupier in southern Germany uh before he was a killer met his death in a hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was\nAnd many other a\nPowerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis\nTo spy and work against the Soviet Union which is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe and you remember him from killing ... bad one actually fight them he wanted to fight Stalin yeah\nSo that's what the new CIA or that took over from the ... says did they enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and gift shop all people to spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union\nAnd they didn't really much care what they did during the war\nIn addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most violent human beings ever to walk the planet called Odessa and and we knew about a year or before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and he thought he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed an organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped these guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the American not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped him a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to a gentle way Italy and on boats to Spain South America and South Africa\nAh it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took him big guys and we took it I meant andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work and so it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nYou wouldn't World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said just go on a cap\nAnd we're in we're in a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people you know we just ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people that all that couldn't happen yeah it did it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify want this country and others the Vatican and others did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did you know in killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male to go after Adolf Eichmann\n... they had to say if you don't Mr President will lead to the press that you're not going to go after I who who did that and that that forced forced Truman to do it\nWho who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that I have two men didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg and it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in a concentration camps and an insult true\nThat Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it but he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tad bit if you will some orders for thought from his latest killing series\nKilling the ss and it is a a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five

that\nWell I mean are they going to ask you was and it sounds like an exaggeration but truly he was the most important spy of the Cold War I mean\n... to make a huge amount of different history they don't they kind of change the the the kind of direction of policy at the highest levels they you know the oil the wheels of diplomacy they may make us safer they may make us less safe\n... actually go into the central cortex all how west some policy was being formed in the late eighties and actually when he began to begin the beginning of the end of the Cold War\nAn amazing tale and uh I suppose to a certain extent it could be considered a the mirror image of a the infamous British double agent ...\nYes it's a compassionate is often made I didn't eat I've written a book about can feel before Kim ... was that was the sort of a infamous British Agent who was an MIT six office that he worked full British Intelligence for almost all his adult life but throughout that time he was actually spying for the KGB he was\nThese adult life but through at that time he was actually spying for the KGB he was spying for the Soviet Union\n... is the precise mirror image in lots of ways he's the person he was a KGB officer highly distinguished it ended up the Kindle and the KGB\nBut all the time or the most of the time he was actually working for British intelligent he was producing material of the highest old or\nA throughout the latter part of the Cold War so if if ... is kind of I think the spy in the midst of ... of of sort of wasted intelligence for the first half of the Cold War or they go to ... is a spy in that camp for the second top\nOut he was the ... if you look at some people you say well a bad person was born to do what they're doing that would seem to apply to all the ... the son of two KGB agents went to the best Soviet institutions was there ever a doubt\nBeing this Rand Paul was being built between east\nAnd west that was one moment that was the crushing of the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia when the great reform movement that took place in Czechoslovakia sixty eight was brutally put down by the Soviet Union again he found that\nAlmost impossible to take so that was sort of world events that were happening but there was also kind of a private moment for like which was that he had been deployed by the KGB to Denmark\nOr in the in the Nineteen sixties\nAnd he'd witnessed the way the scene the freedoms that were available in the west he's been able to listen to whatever music he wanted to to we would have a book she wanted to to to read whatever newspapers were available and and and I think that that happened is only to the idea that really what he'd been living on there was a kind of monstrous lie\nOn the other hand it took a very long time before western intelligence was able to really mean I mean there was a very elaborate courtship\nThat took place at the space of several years during which they could maybe it sort of Hoff clear that he might be available to the other side but there there was a moment when when the ethics officer who was trying to recruit him send to send a message back to London saying I think they go to ... trying to recruit me\nI mean because it was so subtle this kind of adults that was going on between them that they would show which side was doing Walt\nI gather that at at at least in part a oh like was rebelling against his father\n[noise] yes I mean there is there is a sort of personal psychological as it was sort of element to this which was that his father was a ... he ... his father had done some pretty terrible things during the Nineteen thirties I saw him as a kind of weak man who had gone along with\nWhat the Soviet system required of him he saw him as a kind of combination yes man\nAnd then they would close in fact father and son I think policy it will like felt was a kind of rebellion against this kind of weirdly ... road that his father had taken in the creation of the communist state his mother was also important into his mother was\nQuietly rebellious I mean she never really spoke out against the communist regime but she was quietly gunning against it from the beginning\nWhen he was like six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to ... what was it the pique your interest in this case\n[noise] I've actually known for a long time I mean are they still lives in Britain um he is in a safe house or in in in ... in the size of of of Britain and\nI've visited him many times I first came across in many years ago when I was writing a A N e books and he knew some of the characters involved and I managed to make contact with him throughout my six and I've since become a very close to him I see him I still see him quite a lot we we add one point I was seeing every week and I I\nJust gradually kind of talk this story out of him I have about a hundred and forty hours of recording interviews with their leg and he's he's an extraordinary man because he has a perfect the fight too graphic memory\nOne of the things that that they taught them and say that spice school was hired to memorize vast amounts of material\nOr legs powers of recollection a quaint extraordinary I mean he can tell you what it smells like in a particular room in the basement of KGB headquarters on a Tuesday in Nineteen sixty two and that's an amazing results if you've ever known fiction writer\nWell I I daresay it certainly is so he cooperated with you I'm Wondering the extent to which are in my six uh uh the CIA anybody else or in an official capacity cooperated with you\nWell the the also that to me is that nobody cooperated with me at an official capacity I mean there is no you know that this that my six did not have any control over this book a tool on the other hand\nThey didn't stop me from talking to the and my six officers who had run or they go to ask you for the years that were at least a dozen of them and I spent ... ... ... everyone who was involved in the running of this case\nAnd that was fantastic I mean that that meant that I had I had this kind of amazing way of being able to talk to to all the other people

Soviet section within the CIA\nA man of great intelligence and on and on sort of brilliant I'm kind of forensic approach to detail no no button guy but it was the person who decided in Nineteen eighty one or Ninety eighty two that\nThe CIA needed to know when they see information was coming from they need to know who was the British spy that was producing this great amount of material because the Brits were passing along this stuff\nTo the CIA but they would never say where it came from that kind of one of the conventions in in international kind of spy craft as you don't give away all souls and so and my six would never explained the CIA where it came from and button ... among others felt\nThat they need to find out they need to find out who it was that was producing this information and so they began\nTo trying to launch their own investigation into the identity of the British spy\nAs now those are in the book here I'll just quote\nAnd so with approval from above Gerber launched\nA discrete spy hunt early in Nineteen eighty five years struck to the CIA investigator the son about I'm covering the identity of the British super spy and my six our ally after all the British him I should know account discover what was going on\nGerber did not see this as a betrayal of trust and still less was spying on an ally he believed it was more aid tying up of loose ends prudent and legitimate cross checking\nAll right so far so good and now we come to the person who became a key in this operation it's a name we've heard before who was that\nThat was old rich aims ... by you know\nWell I mean this you know I mean it's new full of of buttoned up a buddy in fact the tricky aspects of his was that the head of the country and ... section in the in the ... section was old which aims to was about to go to the KGB\nSo you've got you got to really strange situation here where the KGB spying effect through the on the CIA and the CIA is trying to find out who am I six sizes that spy and and my six he's spying on the KGB so what happened is that\nThe uh the older James ... foot to spy for the KGB he went to the Soviet embassy in Washington DC\nOh such a spy for the KGB he went\nTo the Soviet embassy in Washington DC in in may Nineteen eighty five and offered to give them everything he knew in return from money older James was one of those spice who really was basically they didn't tiny by greed\nAmazing so you have here a double agent ostensibly Soviet been working for the west and his identity is now being investigated\nBy an American a double agent ostensibly working for the U.S but actually working soon to be working for the Soviets I mean that reads like the plot out of a novel\nWhat seems completely unlike ... I suppose one of the things that he's Saturday in the house of espionage which is that it's all about is that you know it's all about\nKind of double crossing really ... and older James is the fact that he figuring all sorts of ways I mean he he did it for money but\nBut you know he's been a a an officer of the CIA for very long time I knew a lot of secrets and he clearly knew the identity of I let go ski he was able to have that ...\nThe two are despite the fact that they both became double agents to sound\nVery a different from one another you you're right at some length about a ... a getting drunk at parties are leaving classified information on the train he sounds like the exact opposite of a ... who was I guess I guess in many ways a very precise and very professional\nYes I mean they were they different characters although in a bizarre twist of fate they would eventually meet\nLittle normally like go to ask you got out yeah and I'm you know after he escaped one of the people that he went to brief at the CIA because of course older chains have not been identified by this point do not expose was older James I remember very vividly city across the table\nThinking that he was a very charming interesting man NO NAME that this was actually the person that had sent him to death or would have liked to have done so they were very different character is very interesting the I mean when he first signed up with western intelligence\nAgencies that he didn't want to be paid he did not want to be given any money he was doing it because he believes it is not because he wanted to buy a new car and I do to change comes from a very different world ready he comes from a very different psychological position\nStay with us more to come back entire the author of the spy and the trader back in the moment\nIf you suffer from E.

of course because you've got to plan the logistics of it all where he responding words every one being deployed basically when it happens and then five thousand more that are there\nSo I mean this is

maps thank goodness much different from those of you listening you get it tornado versus hurricane which is worse I mean it's almost a ridiculous question and since I have been in both\nNot the worst of the worst with a tornado the aftermath of a tornado yes\nThe worst of the worst in the middle of a hurricane yet right in the middle of a hurricane I experienced what that was like\nWhere you're basically trapped urine locked down\nSo I Love that too because then I was a kid but I Love that the evacuation really happened and people he them where we didn't used to do that it wasn't quite the same thing it doesn't mean that nobody clear it out but not the way they do it now it's much much different\nI mean it's eggs from this hurricane into this New York limo crash I mean\nThis status ever and I ... it is one of the deadliest road accident in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were saying the deadliest you know why twenty people were killed it was over the weekend\nAnd I was watching one of the college football games and I thought it was a mistake I thought\nOh no they must means that people were injured and a couple of people were killed and then now we're saying to stretch limousine tailed Eighteen people in a limo to people who were walking and it and that's twenty\nSo uh I mean that's terrible and what happened was that the limo went through a stop signs and boom I you know unfortunately ... collided and killed the people that were in the limousine\nAnd to kill the people that were in the limousine and it was um I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked I mean just the worst a victim ... did that dilemma we've been terrible condition minutes before the crash\nSo you had various surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board in terrible conditions Leno and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happen or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limousines didn't have that this is what this Garrett didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate\nFailed state inspection last month how do you know that right he limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever are you asking about that are you taking into that now so they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery though two people were killed you had um\nThe people that were in the limousine you you had um husband's then why would you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was attacked the tech methods I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo because there was a last minute replacement after a buck hired to shuttled a group broke down because that's the first thing that happened I mean what\nAre you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific because you know in their twenties and thirties um yeah really\nJust really really\nOne of the biggest losses of life and and this is what the first responders thing that they've seen a long time and in just in an instant like that land into giving you the further details on the story it's a dilemma ran a stop sign slammed into a parked SUV and then the two people\nOf you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there them they were hit so it's a\nIt's it's just awful and it does make you kind of think and\nI don't know why because I got to say what are you doing if you order a limousine you're asking people hating company hey are they good uh-huh hey I'm One of the people say about them out there on time they get you know are they do they know if they have a federal certificate\n... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people\nIn his limousine now maybe I got to ask a few more questions or find something else out about that\nCompany because those people were thinking that they're just thinking I gotta be kidding me the first we had the breakdown let me get an limousine and this happens and

night [noise]\nHis side is\nSaw they say you know the mid term elections are gonna be interesting I think it'd be interesting to see what happens in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild the week there's no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House in the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court deserve better than a terrible\nPain and suffering and he was forced to in door he said\nUh for his part Kavanaugh said he would assume the role of gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but ... over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd it's a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think we're going to see\nA rip the country apart and this this far from over I think we're going to see many more protests are going to see some fallout from this or or not one of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins as somebody who\nWas um\nSpot on basically in the wars that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and again that's sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact she said because there there were donating ones that are ... million dollars I think now that were put out there saying that if she votes yes on Kavanaugh\nAll those credit cards would be process to there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think if our policy can come to the point where people are trying to buy votes and by positions that weren't very sad place she was on sixty minutes when she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began to campaign last month to pressure her she because they knew she was the key swing vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process\nAnd if she voted no like I said the donations wouldn't would be a would not be taken for the donors in the ... the pledges word process\nSo now\nWhoever the main Democrat is in two years we'll get that money that's being raised ... interesting because calling\nOn friday heading into as we can announced he would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault she said and concerns about threats roe v Wade with predominantly conservative justices on the Supreme Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now it's you know over the three million dollar mark like I said and this is still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect on a senator Collins\nBut I look at what Michael dealings and he that red spot intensifying I look at that one hundred and ten mile an hour winds and I think now I live there and that along that Florida Panhandle I Am gone color meat on\nAs a hundred and eleven miles an hour for hundreds of making landfall on Wednesday afternoon or evening between Pensacola really in the far western panhandle it's looking like just south of Tallahassee the warning is so's severe and so worrisome\nThat the Florida State they have cleared the deck Tuesday through friday

border so it could produce some really\nTerrible debris storm surge maybe up to twelve feet from parts of the Florida coast\nAnd its course and his wife have been declared a state of emergency to get out don't get caught off guard I mean I wouldn't sit on the edge I Would that's what I did these people boarding up they're smart I mean look you lose a couple of days you come back and not the worst thing that can happen to you that's\nThe you know if you're gone you're gone that you can't replace wife and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back in that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it\nDissipates but boy does not look like at a keep checking that map and it's not is that's not happening to this look to the very very serious very very serious and sadly what they're talking about some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was a horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm is not that they're not gonna get that hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that was a crushing and the first place and part of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility\nIn New York they're not talking about hurricanes are talking about the state of limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license dilemma wasn't supposed to be on the road they fail to state inspection and as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including two pedestrians in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown at outside of\nUm Albany New York and his dad these it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and they they're investigating but the limo slammed in\n[noise] they're investigating but\nThe limos slammed in to a park S. U. V.\n[laughter] so the people inside just killed four sisters die he just bought a new limit blew through stop signs slams into the park SUV everybody inside was killed and then the two bystanders\nAre died as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know these young families young married in their twenties early thirties\nUm I Can't imagine what they're going to have to have can they shut down the company the company had um\nYou know it's crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating miss the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm a few tens as an undercover informant for the FBI White House and you know what the governors saying and he's right is they had no business having missed on the roadway it's failed inspection they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all these things are ... that have [noise]\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people's lives I mean wow there was a couple that just were married like four months ago ...\nThat's just an unexplainable thing and I just like I said I Know that area I Know that area well up by um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nSo that's what the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from ah this past\nWeekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen is the former President George Bush and\nHis daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding or is just the families in I'm In Maine so Barbara Bush walks down the aisle\nWith her father T W and our wedding or what to Craig coins who is a screenwriter someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend\nAnd released a few pictures you know we're on a social media and whatnot cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that I'm looking at a happy as can be but um no ... no big announcement snowed giant\nWedding none of that just the um private ceremony so good for them\nFor them that they pulled it off and it shows yeah time flies she's thirty six years old or husbands I guess is thirty seven and she cofounded a public health non profit called global health corps\nSo her sister genna Bush of course they are like I said with her daughter's um\nThat that was just to me that was cool moment is a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how was that that whole sort of understand that things were not telling the mania we're not getting we're going to try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can have some pictures come out\nAnd they managed to do it which is\nShocking 'cause it's so hard to keep keep anything in secret anymore\nNow and he can't you can't keep the secret um you can't

what are some of the people that are getting hit by this besides there's some auto parts and you know what not and I guess one of them is because think of the things that are made in China dollar trade you're going to dollar tree with this ten percent tariffs on the two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nThere's a place where they're getting hit because they're jacking up the prices what do you think for the dollar tree sorry because of the ... a terrorist is the five dollar tree now\nFive dollar tree you're still getting a bargain trust me but he they've had to um pull

email\nNewsletter and you know Tom yesterday we got the chance to speak with Greg zero about everyday twenty to sell the Senate races today it's ... house races Greg zero our elections could just call him our elections guru\nWho's very ... he was very go to Greg zero joining us from the Bloomberg to a ... a Ninety nine one studios in Washington Greg tell us about the\nHouse races because that seems to be the place where the Democrats\nAre looking to take control\nThat's right it's more likely than not Democrats win control the house of representatives a variety of reasons or enthusiasm money and others mid term election history we've\nStill got twenty days to go until the election and dozens of races that are still\nOn a knife edge and the big question for me is whether the Democrats can parlay those advantages and enthusiasm and candidate money into the votes they need they need a net gain of twenty three seats I think they're more likely than not to do it but um there's still a lot a lot of race is still up in the air and a twenty days in this business still maternity\nGreg can you give us the specific race or one or two races that would indicate a shift or a greater trend are there specific races that we should watch for whether the Democrats really are gonna you know take home the the er the trophy\nHere I Am watching about eighty districts nationwide and looking ahead to election night already\nI'm looking at some of the states that poll closed their polls early in one of the early states to close the district as Kentucky there is a district in Lexington a Lexington, Kentucky where President Trump just visited to kind of boost the Republican candidate normally a Republican leaning district\nPolls closed at six pm eastern time an election night there that's going to be I think in early indicator I we have just brings that foreign Virginia and then there are fewer New Jersey where polls close at eight PM then I'm going to be watching very closely\nI you know you're the pro I Am in our view income is really in so many others do as well\nI just ... noodle into one district so today I went up to Cedar Rapids Iowa and I looked at the first district in the northeast corner of Iowa and it's sort of like it in between he you know red and blue state very purple and all that in ground zero what interests me is a cabinet affect\nAs you say twenty days is an attorney do you have any knowledge yet if that Republican boosted Mitch McConnell talked about yesterday sustains\nA it's very hard to say I don't know if it really helped him as much in the house there is some evidence that may have\nKind of help them close some gaps in some of the Senate races because the Senate map as we discussed yesterday is very skewed toward very Republican leaning states where you think he might have a more pro Kavanaugh or killed in some of those races but the house rap Israeli front there are a lot of districts that are very competitive I'm not sure there was much having all bound\nTo our political did a great article today on all the money the good jillion dollars sloshing around ... what does your observation and how the millions of dollars this time around is different\nIt's different in that other Democrats have not really had this anywhere close this amount of enthusiasm manifested in donors giving this much money the Democratic candidates I mean this is money that the candidates are raising this is not so called outside money where Republicans traditionally Republican groups have traditionally had an advantage\nShow the enthusiasm his manifests itself in kind of these special elections we've watched\nThe uh the the polls that indicate Democrats are more eager to vote than Republicans and democratic donors are giving it away at levels we've never seen before giving to House Democratic candidates\n... can you tell us about Pennsylvania seventeenth district because that's an interesting race\nRight it say unusual race that you have two incumbents running against each other after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court redrew the district lines to benefit at least\nSee each other after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court redrew the district lines\nTo benefit at least has the effect of benefiting Democrats because it overturned a Republican or drawn map\nYou have Conor Lamb a Democrat who won a special election earlier this spring he just after the ones who are on he decided to run against Republican Congressman Keith rothfus in a more competitive district and I have to get lamb the edge of her office there but it's unusual that you have two incumbents running\nWho Sidney Crosby one\nWith a great question [laughter] that'd be a price endorsement\nAnd he got there I saw it I don't know what you're stumped me there yeah how about give us the big visibility Florida the Senate race in and we talked about it yesterday but yeah my my take is amateurs like ... we're always circling back to these big Senate races in big states\nYeah that's right the for the Senate racism Markey race I recall out against Bill Nelson um millions of dollars spent Rick Scott has spent about forty million dollars his own money and it's also overlaid with a very competitive governor's race there as well between a Andrew Gillum that Ronda Santa so for always seems to be close every year and I think this is no exception\nIs that also the case for Florida's twenty seventh district\nThe twenty seventh as one of the closest races in the country illegally honor roll slate and then they're very popular retiring moderate um is no longer defending that seat it's a state where Trump that terribly Hispanic majority district in the Miami area Donna Shalala the former health and Human Services secretary\nHas been struggling to put that district the way it should be a pretty comfortable democratic pick up but um she's up against a a Cuban American journalist in South Florida who is certainly one of the stronger candidate so it's it's one of the more favorable matchups I think for the Republicans\nFor federal rated Scott over a quarter of a century of expertise and experience RJ Gallup thanks very much for being here All right

fact that interest rates in the United states are having higher of growth has outperformed many people's expectations inflation or a year every year basis has gone up about a half a percentage point from where it was six eight months ago and the fed is normalizing monetary policy\nWith the question now in everybody's mind\nIs the fed going so far as to potentially over tightened do they end up sowing the seeds of a top and yield a turnover and risk assets and we obviously have been living with that sort of dynamic in October meanings have reacted to all of those forces so the total return\nOn the Munich front as you know it's a pretty weak I mean you're talking about ... about about\nA Ninety basis points on the air you know incrementally performing\nTaxable bond by you know

immunity to thirty year treasury it's over a hundred percent\nSo for a wealthy individual you're getting nominal yield\nTo both of treasuries are a little higher hundred percent right now in a long term treasury and you get a tax break to boot\nSo when you look at the the just the price as you did there Tom you're seeing just a part of the return ... you're you're missing the income and you're

percent you're caught up on markets let's get back to Bloomberg Politics policy power in law\nI think President Trump is once again speaking out against the Federal Reserve telling Fox Business network that chairman Jerome Powell is in danger bring economic growth in America\nIs the fed the fed is amazing race too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him [laughter] and I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going confess\nI Want to bring in now Mike joining Bloomberg News White House deputy team leader and our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studio here in Washington DC so like the president says the biggest threat is the said why do you think now that said\nWell he's been a riding the rise in the stock market and often turns to that as a way of affirming his economic policy is a lot of his sales of\nOf why he's a good president have to do with the pace of the economy\nAnd the Federal Reserve as is common when an economic expansion gets going is starting to raise interest rates which will reduce economic growth\nSo he's both a setting up an alibi for himself it ... goes poorly or turns down economic he's setting up the groundwork to blame the fed\nBut he's also showing a tension that has existed for a lot of presidents where they when the economy's going well they want it to keep going well inflation's threat down the road it's not a current\nThreat and so they tend to resist the interest rate hikes the Federal Reserve does you can ask Jimmy Carter how well it worked for him when Paul Volcker finally brought inflation under control just toward the end of his first term\nBut all of those presidents or had to swallow the fact that the fed is independent of the president said so in that interview he said the fed is independent so I don't speak to them but I'm not happy of why we even talk about it then\n[noise] well this president's broken a lot of those kinds of precedents and norms hum but the there's a reason why the president's want to show that the Federal Reserve is independent\nWhich is because investors have more confidence in inflation and the currency in any economy if the monetary policy authority truly is independent\nNow Trump is is saying that hey I still say they're independent and I'm not going to fire a power which by the way normal presidents haven't raised the idea of firing the fed chairman in the past [noise]\nUm but ... he and his own way is trying to say they're independent even as she pours out this rhetoric blaming them and criticizing them so he's he's also in his own way respecting that boundary but it's just a little less clear and a little less less of a strong signal to the market\nThan the way recent presidents over the past few decades have\nTreated the Federal Reserve and when you look at the fed in terms of the last couple of years you've seen some lawmakers most notably\nLibertarian leaning Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Go after the fed on a host of issues including has proposed legislation of to audit the Federal Reserve this was something that the president had said during the campaign\nHe would be open to but really backed off really listening to the like the treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on that particular point do you think that it would ever get to the point where there's a policy pitch or something like the fed\nI don't see the appetite in Congress at the moment and actually during the Nineteen eighties um during the recession early in the Reagan Administration after the Jimmy Carter recession boats were related to high interest rates\nThere was really strong uh feelings among Democrats in Congress that uh the Federal Reserve needed to be curbed back that Volcker was being too aggressive and costing people's\nJob so we've seen much more of a backlash against the Federal Reserve in Congress in the past and the Federal Reserve has\nWithstood it survived and without any encroachment on its independence I personally do not see strong enough interest in Congress to actually change that relationship\nHave you seen any hint at all anywhere that the president's rhetoric\nHave you seen any hint at all anywhere that the president's rhetoric is having any effect [noise] I haven't\nSeen and I and our markets team I think it looked at this or the last few days they haven't seen a change in inflationary expectations among investors which would be probably the first place you would see it if there was like a\nYou can compute from from bond yields and and different types of bond yields what the implied in flesh and expectations are\nFor investors if they were to start to worry that hey Trump is going to put pressure on the Federal Reserve\nSuch that the Federal Reserve wouldn't raise interest rates when they otherwise thought they needed to to head off inflation than you would expect to see the um the inflationary expectations among investors to start to rise and we haven't seen that yet as far as I've heard\nHim we're going to get a lot more from my interview with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell coming up\nLater Republicans still not running away\nFrom the issue of the economy they feel that this is something that can still help them ahead of those mid term elections and my ... Bloomberg News White House deputy team leader thank you so much\nFor making the time for us here in our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studio in Washington I always loved to do it and coming up on Bloomberg\n... we're going to much more this is Bloomberg [noise]\nThen president Donald Trump says the U.S is asking turkey for audio and video relating to the missing Saudi journalist ... ... if it exists the president was asked about a possible recording today as he took questions from reporters in the oval office\nThat has come out in the New York times with some gruesome details of what apparently a tape seems to indicate about the murder of a catch ... does that ratchet up the pressure on the administration to to come to some sort of conclusion here\nI mean the tape will ratchet up the pressure I think\nIn addition this misguided engagement by secretary on pay you both in Saudi Arabia as well as in Turkey it's not a\nEngender confidence in Congress doesn't engender confidence with our allies I Believe we're in a situation that we're much more will need to be done and the president and secretary Ontario are are going to hear that message loud and clear\nBrett the president has said that the Saudis should be quote unquote innocent until proven guilty or not it might be another example of that he said that the Fox business just a last night\nWhen I talk to Republicans up on Capitol Hill including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the interview of which were going up later this hour\nA day or really uneasy in terms of how this could impact us Saudi relations and even you know invoking things like the man Nick magic ski act which would essentially forced the president to issue sanctions against individuals\nSo I guess talk to me about the ... the separation between Republicans in the Senate\nAnd what this administration is doing\nA lot more at stake here and unfortunately I think the White House there's myopic we focus on some short term economic issues perhaps as well what do you use as the interest in Syria or Iran but let's just take Iran deal as one example\nThe administration has been a out trying to criticize the Iran extra curricular activities\nIt looks pretty hypocritical for them to remain silent for them to give the benefit of the doubt to Riyadh a for doing many of the same kinds of activities whether it's in the case of draw the show he or in Yemen with respect to the rights of or women's and other activists in Saudi Arabia\nThe president has to be feeling this pressure when one of his ah Gulf partners Senator Lindsey Graham says he's heard enough sanction them\nAnd I think he is hearing much more a privately both from folks on Capitol Hill from the business community look there are a number of American business leaders who came out and took a principle position on this\nThey don't want to be left out a holding the bag on this they're stuck to the White House his show that the American a president is going to exert strong leadership and back them up\nBob picked up on precisely the point that I think is getting a lot of tension with Senator Lindsey Graham because it yesterday he essentially went on the fence and took the gloves off against the crown prince and be as you said that he's toxic and quote unquote has to go that's a ... of rhetoric\nA ... that we're hearing from from one of the most influential Republican senators in the Senate Brett\n[noise] it is and and someone who sneaks in many respects for Donald Trump so they're going to have to reconcile this uh the efforts by Riad hugest sweep this under the wrong I think are falling short of the expectations in Washington other capitals around the world we're going to need to see more\nSo the president to come back to this tape that apparently a exist according to this account of the New York\nTo this tape that apparently\nA exist according to this account of the New York times or the president said today to reporters in the oval office said that he is asking turkey for this tape if it exists and he said it probably does he if he gets that tape and if it does indicate what the New York times uh carries in its account\nOr is there any other decision that could be made\nBut here's the problem that played the Turkish government says they have\nLike a tire was just in turkey\nHe would have asked to hear that case but it is a reasonable expectation and one that um we we should have seen if the U.S has been this ration was taking this seriously the fact that he left his uncle and doesn't have that tape and and I haven't heard it allegedly\nUm ears indicative of how the shipping industry shouldn't doesn't want\nTo pursue a furious restoration\nQuickly just what do you think this means we talked about Saudi Arabia what do you think this means for the U.S relationship with turkey is that's sort of trend toward Russia and away from it\nI think we're going to see a more positive trends are out of us Turkish relationship after ... from your home on both sides want to move on\nOur thanks to Brett brew in the heat is former director of global engagement at the Obama White house and president of the global situation room he joined us on the telephone today we will have more of course on the story\nOf ... and the continuing investigation coming up on Bloomberg Politics policy power and law President

over how high to push interest rates would the majority appearing to favor and eventually and temporary move above the level of de de neutral for the economy in the long run so\nSeveral hockey to me but let's see what our team thinks about that ... in the house economist had Bloomberg economics I enter a plea bargain to rocket broke a studio am I reading it right\nAbsolutely go that is a it's a Hawkeye State but I don't know if it's more hawkish\nThan we have a couple of weeks ago but I think they're they're doubling down and let the markets know hey look we are looking at women rate increase this year maybe two to three next year I'm and more importantly or surprising to me and this is they're talking about going above\nHum a\nDuring becoming restrictive but there are no signs of that inflation is picking up the on two similar they think perhaps there they're looking I mean there's always pressure so their crews are looking at something and saying we're going to get a ... wage pressure I think there's this book about belief but there's you know economic evidence\nIn past cycles that wage pressure as you remove a number of slack and economy get wage pressure get inflation\nThat has not been the case or at least not as strongly as you would have thought given that we have an unemployment rate of three point seven so it looks as if they expect the economy to continue to grow up well above trend and then eventually at some point we're going to get a question about too\nSo we should point out stocks taking a bit lower ... to get a little higher dollar taking to a session high at the read I'm I'm looking at our ... blog right now from what I've read it or it's markets more or less taking this in stride more specifically the S. and P. down about one tenth of one percent\nOf the kind of like saying he's the markets reporters bond says I can tell you a break something so you do wonder you know what the fed is old gamer\nHey let's bring in all of a day well since ... federal Bloomberg News also in our Bloomberg interact and broke her studio I'm Dave Jason hit it right we did see stocks kind of take a little bit of a leg down a little bit\nA little bit that's the key I mean considering what the market's been through in the past week or so you know they're holding up relatively wow it's not like\nThe idea of the Fed's re going above what they would consider neutral is exactly a new concept I mean it is something that's been floating around maybe it's more explicit now that we have the minutes out there but\nThere there's been that thought for some time at least that you know just pushing it to a neutral wouldn't\nBe enough well and and days it's a really good point that this has been out there in the markets and and Tim ... still with it you know we've talked a lot about the communication from the Jay Powell said so far and they had been you know\nOn a relative bases pretty trends parents so no surprises here presumably if you're sitting at the fed this is the market reaction you want which is essentially like yeah\nAbsolutely I just kind of like right we've been feeding you that's been feeding in his\nInside speak that's the expected reaction\nUh but yeah I Would say this is exactly what they want\n'em that's why the commission communication strategy change earlier this year ah it specifically in the in ... speech in August at Jackson Hole when the markets went a little crazy and when he said well we're we're moving away from our star and these stars you know navigating by the stars\nBut I think what happened is that people over shot and said well they're not looking at these equilibrium variables at all and you can see in some of the comments today that they're still say we're looking at these things\nBut we removed or I think they're the reason for a moving um a lot of the discussion on this was to get rid of a point us make get rid of a a destination they can give themselves some wiggle room as we approach\nThese equal rights and maybe even go above so I Do think that this is what they wanted to see from the market I expect um the communication strategy to be\nA little bit I'm ... I'm\nI'm not going to communicate more over the next couple of months as we used to kind of acclimate to the new kind of greater area where we are going\nWell and good market reaction I Can't give away a story that there is something interesting coming up in the magazine that takes a look specifically at kind of\nThem are cats in the relationship between bonds in stocks and\nAh you know ... much of the time coming off the financial crisis we off into stocks and bonds trading in tandem which is something unusual wall it looks like now the markets investors are saying okay we've got some inflation here maybe a little bit more right I mean they're entertaining that there's differences between stocks and bonds and react that\nKind of a shift has been going on I Will tell you that there is a sharp floating around a boomer terminal actually put out on my Twitter feed earlier that the one day looking at\nA relationship between bond yields and what a caller earnings you'll so basically the\nPrice ... ratio the some five hundred turn it on its head and track down in relative terms and when you saw stocks fall late January early February and also in March then then in the past couple of weeks\nYou saw the gap between those two ah as now was this year so it's clear that people are paying attention to sort of this cross market\nTension here so that while we have you here just quickly give us your read X. fed on the markets today after a few shall we say up and down days the U.S market\nRight and it started out as it down they sort of worked its way back you can find the plusses if you want to in terms of\nResults maybe the biggest one United continental and airline raising its ah twenty Eighteen profit estimate for the third time this year this industry that clearly has pricing power I mean given what deny it had to say\nAnd given the fact that they're facing something like a thirty percent increase in jet fuel costs ... a year ago and that's one of their biggest expenses\nAnd nonetheless they're anticipating a revenue gross\nA even after those costs are coming out of the equation so right you know ... it's definitely a situation is working in favor of this industry or\n... twenty second sense as soon as I said man that's kind of de ... what can investors now what's the most important thing quickly\nActually they go about the job and I think trade has something to watch so we've got these hawkish minutes saying we're going to go above neutral however\nWe have very little time to assess what's been a rather large round the terrorists potentially more tears coming down the pipe\nThe terms that are already in there are escalating from ten percent for rid of temperature the twenty five percent I think this could actually finally have an impact ... and I think that's a downside risk to GDP Growth in the third quarter the for the fourth quarter and that could that could look this make this look a little stale when we get to November December\nAnd they did say trade policy scene disrupting business investment plan so that's when we start to see companies making decisions based on concerns that trait\nThat's one of those things that we expect that they are hearing as they talk to the fed presidents around the country per Jay Powell reflect on that in his last press conference I Believe he mentioned that that's what they were hearing as CEOs and others\nClicked on that in his last press conference I Believe he mentioned that that's what they were hearing as CEOs and others talk to those dead presidents are around the country\nAt the Wilson stocks editor for Bloomberg you'll be back with us with your chart and stock of the day to get back to work stop John with us I don't figure out a these bed minutes with the rest of the Bloomberg uh economics team thanks to you both\nFor joining us All right and it's time for a check on your well the national news headlines\nEvery bottling we'd go he's in our eleven thirty newsroom in New York said hey Bob\nCarol thank you and the President Trump and his top diplomats are competing against putting the entire us Saudi Arabia relationship\nAt risk over the disappearance of ... as the crisis over the missing journalist escalates more than two weeks after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul president reiterated to reporters today the crown prince Mohammed bin ... government agreed to by over a hundred billion dollars and us weaponry\nMusic to the years of anyone who's invested in in net flicks\nToday because they really knocked it out of the park a late yesterday after the clothes shares gaining yesterday after market shares gaining again today Dan Morgan vice president and senior portfolio manager\nDown at ... trust company in ...

where right Jason and I think we spoke about three months ago on a ... episode that we did together and\nTherefore it's obviously a revise their guidance going into what was now the third quarter kind of interesting Jason that came in and revise guidance down last second quarter the consensus was around six million\nAnd then they come in on this quarter was six point nine million so it's almost like the guided us down them they blew away the previous guidance and I don't know it's kind of interesting but\nPosting because there is that they didn't really get all of these subscribers come kinda later in the court or did they not had a really good grasp on their subscribe regrets what does it say where the sand\nBagging a little further sandbagging exactly do you know Carol says

I've had my differences are\n... that we should consider halting routine intelligence collaboration that would do nothing but put our our citizens and our homeland at risk but we need to not do that uh and and while we consider policy measures I think the president is going to need to own that the the appropriate time there's a bipartisan consensus\n'em to go pretty far and and consider freezing

Anthony Scaramucci we'll check in with us James O'Keefe his latest undercover video also is it possible Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren loses the Massachusetts Senate race and she really wants to just run for president\nHe refused things an anarchist could do whatever they want\nThe politician did what every red blooded American would do she tried to catch the incident on video and then the assailant was having none of that cursing at are backing or into the street and tell her to go kill yourself then walk to a nearby BP presumably to stop stock up on\nYou know whatever she does a mountain dew whatever it happens to be\nThe go to source or whatever but ... gave chase in her car the man charged her again leaning through the window punching her\nYou know I I mean it's unbelievable\nAnd that's fine incident came two days after another House Republican candidate Shane McClellan was punched in the face in St George township northeast of St Cloud\nIs just campaigning in a bar in a restaurant with a larger guy approaches them ascribe the conversation is Amy a bowl until the guy literally and invoke the hallowed name of the middle class the man we can only assume didn't wish to hear another politician talking about whatever\nThe only punches the Republican in the face\nOh getting their faces oh ah create a crowd you know follow them\nInto a grocery stores gas stations department stores restaurants and I wanted anywhere anymore Anthony Scaramucci is with us by the way next week he's got a great book I've been reading it I got an early copy it's phenomenal and it's called a Trump the blue collar president\nUh I Know it's too early to talk about the book but you tell some amazing stories about who really Donald Trump is where he came from and and his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot reading it how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know you're you're you're mentioning a lot of very interesting things and one thing I always remember that the president\nHe may hit hardest Sean a buddy always hits second any often hits last I've never seen him unilaterally come after any but it's only after they attack him that he ... down and starts to counter punch you know so Elizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas\nOr a Republican candidate in the primary tacky him and he fires off the nickname\nSort of the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy until you start shooting at him then once you start shooting at him he's gonna hit you were ... or ...\nOr ... is a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nWell let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and\nHe he talked about you which is very interesting to make and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street and he and a and I know both I mean\nYou know he yelled at me he yelled at me after the curse and you've got to remember like\nThe guy Ryan Lizz have legs are total liar he basically said to me there's a call but then he's asking me to do a profile\nWith them and then that's when I have responded with the expert but you know what it is what it is ... but ... what the the president yells at me he said hey man I Need less street Anthony I Need more Harvard Anthony but you know what John what makes you great on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close is that we both have a little bit of that and I only when you were busing\n... when I was washing dishes bussing tables you know I was a cook yeah that's right but you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life\nAnd I don't know I mean I I think a lot of us that are blessed and lucky and successful\nI met too many people that forget what they come from and I'm not going to forget where I came from and I'm just on and so it's not in me\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story a while where we were in these aspirational working class families in our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents\nInto the American dream and so uh what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way to see if we can make that happen for people that were similarly situated or currently similar similarly situated the way we were\nIn the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks of never broke my loyalty from the president because I really do believe his horse in the right place and I really believe that uh you know she is the right\nBut that is in line the proof is in the party I mean when when you go ...\nEars adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more in poverty\nYou can't get three they only president never to get three percent GDP Growth\nThe worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we got four point two percent for the second quarter of this GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter you know that we have four million more Americans working eight million out of off of food stamps and out of poverty\nI'm thinking okay finally the forgotten men and women\nThe young Scaramucci's in Hannity's now\nDoing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nI you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing to ...\nI you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better\nBecause he's continuing to de layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back on shore of the United states I Know you talk a lot of that uh the re engineered now after the U.S MCA now\nUh Shaun I'm going through that you know I'm trained as an economist and I'm running an eleven and a half billion dollars on that I found it\nOn that is going to have monumental positive benefits to middle and lower middle class families the re engineering of that trade agreement because it just to configuration of the cars\nJust the uh the manufacturing point and the price on labor or that's been agreed to in those agreement is going to need more disposable income for working class family and by the way you know where was the establishment politicians thinking about those people over the twenty five years of

look at his comment\nI've traveled calls out California for environmental regulation he claims make the state's wild fires much worse in each week the president called on California to increase access to water injury management a sentiment many residents other state had been demanding for decades beginning in the Nineteen seventies\nThe California government adopted a hands off nature policy fourteen forestry industry out of the forest while many experts claim it hasn't been Scientifically Proven the policy is an effective\nIt is still the overbearing governing mentality dictating the state's water inland usage according to researchers at the University of Arizona humans have more of an environmental impact on wildfires than anticipated but not in the way one would expect\nAccess timber comes out of the forest one way or the other it is either carried out or it burns out but it comes out\nIn the ... century humans became directly involved with California for it but they had the lead destructive wildfires during peak years the logging industry\nSome said is because of sports management Alps cleared the forest of dead trees brush an actual ground clutter all which contribute to the hot and explosive wildfires we see today\nOr the kind of probably around eighty million dead trees in California we're seeing sections of force land that overnight basically are turning around\nFor a sit in the Golden State used to average forty trees per acre now the average one hundred trees per acre\nFurther more trees consume lots of water leaving the ground in surrounding plans to try that combined with the state's tendency to have long periods of drought\nIt'd be perfect recipe for the most destructive wildfires in the country according to lawmakers the Golden State had some of the strictest environmental laws in the country and they may be contributing to the streets fires\nThe level of activity currently means to me increased about tenfold to actually increase the health of our for us experts\nClaims humans in nature can reach us is the number balance\nAnd why we cannot completely stop forest fires they're beneficial steps we can take to make them less destructive many experts agree with the president's assessment of the issue and the the first steps to correcting that golden state's fire problem is by addressing land management

I I'm In the housing business I built apartments in Indiana that cost one fifth of what they would cost here in California\nOne fifth and that difference Patrick is not the cost of the land is the cost of government it is the impact fees and taxes the law suits the red tape\nThe delays in getting approval it tastes almost a dozen years in some cases to get the approval for some of these properties and meanwhile the builders and developers have to sit and pay interest on their debt they have to pay real estate taxes that all ends up being part of the cost\nThat's passed along the people in the form of higher and higher rents right and you know that just is making it so difficult for people certainly it's contributed to the homeless situation because a lot of those people have just been pushed out of their home by higher brands\nBut it's also contributing to this inability of people in California that actually save money and and climb up the economic ladder and when you're spending as much as people in this state Iran rents\nYou've basically given up the chance of having a home ah right I I I was on television and doing a couple of interviews yesterday in Los Angeles

me that they've just given up literally given up on the idea that they would on their own home some day I guess is that the California Dream that we want\nWell let me let me let me just throw this in there and you'll have to indulge me here about what a segue into something with regards to people's homes and California many of them\nAre over the last decade and definitely over the last year or two have been affected by fires affected by wildfires and and you know the homelessness rate can be what it is and they affordability for housing can be what it is but you if you've got this a fire epidemic\nOr all of it can be a for new in some areas of the state I Want to listen to what the president had to say earlier about how California's doing currently with fire a wildfire prevention\nGetting millions of dollars of forest fires in California there's no reason those fires there like they are\n\nDescribing\nCraving and they don't touch 'em they leave and then we ended up with these massive fires that we're paying\nBillions of dollars for\nWhoever's going to be governor of California at your act together\nOr what is your reaction to that to what the president has to say he's this isn't the first time he's been focused\nOn you know and and when he was highlighting is the fact that the fires in California here are man caused a politician caused disaster and why do I say politician cars because we had so many laws that have passed that have prevented\nProper forestry management that's what the president was talking about\nWhat would you do he would build fire breaks in in the forest so that you would have a a buffer place where you could stop a fire from getting out of hand he would clear the forest a dead end diseased trees and brush on the ground to this is basically kindling that turns\nA a a controllable fire into something that's a raging inferno we've even had spouse a fire caused fires spouse to the heat kittens you know intense with all this kitten lane\nAh then it creates a spout almost like a fire tornado and and then the firefighters who by the way are equipped with Nineteen seventies era helicopters they they have bullet holes in 'em from the Vietnam War\nA and again it's because we're misallocated resources over to a train that is way behind budget and you know way over budget way behind schedule you know\nWe're we're creating these these politician caused fires and it's it's running up the cost for all taxpayers in in California and and for all homeowners or you know the insurance rates are climbing in California because of these fires\nFor a couple of more quick ones here I'm the president um of course has been focused a lot over the years since he was elected a sense a well on voter fraud I Want to ask you point blank are you worried about voter fraud November sixth in California\nAbsolutely a California politicians again looking for advantage everywhere they can to maintain their grip on power\nPassed a law that allows ballot harvesting basically political operatives can go in and get ballots filled out and then bring them into the county register and that sounds like better convenience but we're we're hearing reports\nOf a ... operatives going into nursing homes and having people fill out ballots that\nProbably don't really understand what they're filling out a and they're basically harvesting these ballots and bringing them in and basically running up the score or wrongfully and I think this does bear investigating a\nI'm very concerned about voter fraud and the state\nRight where we are just a couple of weeks out a as always we got your website on the screen here um it's too late you said you're going to hit the road yet again Tiller viewers what that's about and or how they can go
