Joe ...\nFix All right they're glad to have your long for the ride that\nThere's a story on the blaze that also I think comes from the Daily Caller\n\nAnd uh it's about who's in this caravan\n\nThere have been allegations that there were other than Central Americans\nIn their other than Mexicans in their shoes in there a\nSpanish language network reporter reveals who was infiltrating migrating caravan heading to the U.S that's the headline from the blaze written by Carlos Garcia a reporter with the Spanish language network Univision revealed that he had met people from a Muslim majority country or infiltrating the migrant caravan from on doors headed towards the U.S border\nQuote they infiltrated themselves in this caravan Univision correspondent for instance go Santa Ana was reporting from a bridge in Guatemala where the migrant caravan was attempting to cross into Mexico on their way to the United states Santa Anna said he had himself met people from Bangladesh\nOh it's interesting the Daily Caller reported a translation\nOf Santa Anna's claims as reported from Mexico the borders in Central American\nI guess they mean Central America are not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily Santa Ana explained across from Costa Rica been later go through Guatemala and eventually make it into our country\nYesterday when we were traveling from Guatemala you said we noticed people from El Salvador and even people from Bangladesh she continued view of management to imagine what they had to do to get here he said they infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross the ...\nImagine what they had to do to get here he said they infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have benefited them greatly sent and a continued to say that they were identified detained by immigration officials\nMexican officials appeared to listen to president Donald Trump demands to stop the caravan from arriving to the U.S border but recent reports indicate that some visuals are eating the migrants on their truck\nMexican ambassador to the U.S admitted Thursday and Fox News and they believe the caravan to be at least partly politically motivated\nWe have evidence that this government is also a very much politically motivated investment Goodyear said we're obviously sensitive to the humanitarian situation that we encounter and we're acting precisely said\nWell we've also made it clear that there is no legal ground on which Mexico can issue a permit by which people can just go through Mexico towards the United states he concluded well why are they still come and then if that's the case\nWhy that he's the ... are they still underway here\nWe come on\nAnd the reason is is because either in Mexico does that love its own country and it does you see the soccer matches where people are all screaming and yelling Mexico and we'd be Mexican flags there's not been a love their own country they just don't think they they should have to worry about it\nThey think that we have more so we should have to worry about it for some reason we're on the hook and I just don't understand that any day nine for one pack Joe packs dot com Senator John Cornyn at the bottom of the er make sure you keep it here for that when you go to the phone lines to Seattle and one is Geoffrey ... in Texas Hi Geoff what's going on\nHey Joe you know I got to tell you man I have a hard job every day and when I come home and I listen to your show by the time is over I'm well\nThank you man I appreciate that that's why I like to do well\nI just yeah I I Know and you should go ahead and put this on CDs or whatever the marketing thing is put it all together from the beginning and then I'll be buying the tower out [laughter]\nI briefly on an airplane like crazy I read it personally thank you\nAnyway I got to just tell you okay just starting here I think this is a perfect storm and I think that the sheriff earlier comes on the kid is a little bit but I think he's in the dark on what I Believe this worry okay\nWhat is these are are in mixed up with military eight eighty percent better I'm saying okay I've been watching the road and eighty percent better as military aged okay Fifteen to thirty\nThirty five okay that's happening now they're picking them up and pick ups in trucks OK and load them up they're coming quicker now I Believe this is a plant and I think\nThe last two they now gone so far they are with ... they're being\nAte it and the money's coming from the chalk arms and Russia and everything communist in South of this I Believe this is a red dawn happening that guy's boss he says and then the other guy called before him that said it was and in Beijing he's more right than he no\nWell I I agree that there was an attempt to see how far they can get it and and it's going to cause the president\nNow there'll be added on there's hundreds of training camps they're gonna be coming out of the\n... if it's if it's not so unfair to key there if it keeps on growing that's going to make this point even more salient the president now but when you're used to hold on hold on a family that I didn't respond back anyway or the president now has the opportunity\nTo do something is the executive in chief as the commander in chief he now sees that this is not just some gaggle of migraines hoping for a better life right this is actually now like fighting age men\nBetter predominant in this caravan of his horde of people and he's gonna have to do more than just put physical presence there without arms you're going to have to put people ... physically fight people if they have to we have to make it clear that the border means something\nGo let me just say this please it's going to not the enemy is here fifty percent of the country okay they're here to chai comes in here by thousands and soldiers okay they already\nSet everything up all the the ... the east coast west they're going to come from everywhere every communist country every thing because the laugh now knows they don't have anything to on this record they know they've been found out\nThey don't have anything going on and except have a civil war and that is happening but still the veterans know what I'm watching it bad\nI'm I'm telling ya I'm seeing it clearly this is the red dawn we've all been bearing and we're looking right at where we're going to come up with everything else but what really is happening everybody there to get\n... on the left by saying that the writers and saying that the majority of middle American Idol saving for nine years and we're not we're not going to sit back and watch your job or not now you've is why we're having conversations like this or not I raised my friend who's in office but now you best military is getting stronger nominee I gotta\nGo jumping knows that dog and I loved Joe Joe like crazy it was very complimentary Lovett Jeff love it I Can't just let you go four minutes and not say anything they actually pay the does the show but I Do love it it's a eighty eight nine four one package Joe ... dot com line three or four is gonna be Fe in Kansas right what's going on about a minute\nAgo I guess if you or is it that this cat and killing that sure I have like a year or two shareware at it is and it and I gather that life any real and all the least thing is getting high rep at village\nWell I think there has to be there has to be some sort of a force waiting on the border so that people coming here ... you know like phone back and say they didn't try to stop us at all did you come on up because then you'll have millions of people\nHeading from you know from lower income uh countries from ... from South and Central American countries and from Mexico itself to come into our borders we we have to make sure we dissuade them as they get closer and that's that's really important fact\nIt really is it's vitally important that we actually dissuade them we can't just say hey welcome Murray New Jersey I've got about a minute Murray make it happen\nYes a chow also I watch it plays\nA blank back and I agree with him a lot he says that these are mocks his communist that are coming to our country and they want to get rid of the western civilization completely [noise] now I also\nHeard someone say mentioned like a solution for the president that fell on the books and I think if the Congress alien act\nGranting oppressing you know the full power\nTo control something like this ... and John Adams our president gave it back then and it's still on the books I don't know if you can get in touch with that Ted Cruz I someone regarding that but I present and cannot let these people and\nI'm with you Maria with you I don't know about the alien actually you're talking about I don't have it in front of me but certainly as we continue this I talk to every member of Congress I can talk to the president if I can we've got to find out what exactly is going to happen with those\nUm the heat in every debate so far John has brought you name up like you're on his side like you would have worked together he really has I mean I don't know if you've seen the you have like I've worked with John ... Senator John Cornyn I and I and John Cornyn so but I Do you think\nI Am I'm sure this is what he's doing but I Wonder if you agree but he's trying to tell moderate those people lean to the right a little bit moderate down in the middle moderate to the left a little bit don't worry I'm not the radical they say I Am John Cornyn Scott ... got my back\nBut I I'm for Ted as you know and I do believe that they do is a radical\nWhen it comes to the policies that he is espousing he is a is a quintessential national Democrat yeah which means he's profoundly out of step with the Texas values and Texas voters on everything from immigration to impeach the president from from a base up polishing eyes\nUm all of these radical positions that are being a spouse at the national level ... says he's four and I guess I have to give him some credit for his candor is he uh is he a\nPleasant guy a yes is he a charismatic yes\nIs he somebody that I ever will be willing to work with where we find common cause on improving our ports of entry and trade 'em but but I certainly think he's the wrong choice or a protects us and we certainly don't need another vote for Chuck Schumer to beat the potentially next majority leader of the United States Senate\nAnd that's exactly what it would be he's made it clear that he would be bad he's also made it clear that that he's sort of be a bit new you know Obama two point oh he's the guidance on eh when he met the guy that's on the late night shows he's the guy that as you said is bringing charisma\nBut not really talking about not outlawed anyway what he would really do as a very far left wing senator from the great state of Texas when you see this much money flowing in from outside of our state is that give you concern\nAbsolutely absolutely this is this is a new phenomenon go I've never seen this before where you have an incumbent senator and a red state like Ted Cruz who's done a good job\nWho um and seeing unprecedented amounts of money coming from all over the country in the small donations that are raised over over the Internet and it's it's a it's a sobering thing because ah to have an incumbent red state senator being out raised and outspent by as an opponent is a is something we've never seen before\nThirty million dollars he's raised it's more than any senatorial campaign ever John should we take a look at a at the availability of people from outside of be the given state\nTo send money in I mean I'm not a big regulation guy I'm a low tax guy but I mean if California orange ... wherever you lives can inject this much money into races in our states or in our counties in our cities I mean who's one of the joint\n[laughter] well that's a good question um and a good point I actually had somebody bring that up to me just a few moments ago after a rally with Ted Cruz and I'm In a ... billion in county\nI'm just north of Austin right and you know we don't allow people from foreign countries foreign nationals to contribute to our national elections from I think that's a legitimate question why should people from other states be able to inject\nTheir money into a race that for whoever will represent the state of Texas such a good good point good question we ought to pursue\nAnd saw Senator John Cornyn senator you been a great supporter of the military even a great supporter of lower taxes lower regulations we're seeing more exports of oil from Texas and the importance I mean where things are looking really good idea they all go we would ever handed to the other party is one that makes me crazy\nUm how do you feel going in a I feel like maybe the Senate gains two or three seats but we've got to get people out to vote and the house really is up for grabs if the house goes the other way\nThe tax cuts to point oh go away tax cuts for middle class families goes away and the economy probably start slowing down but how are you feeling going in\nWell you're right because Nancy Pelosi will be a driver seat and we know that she's Noah\nAir alive or the or find\nCommon cause with President Trump on anything so I think\nBasically Congress will shut down by and large for the next two years\nExcept for we maintain the majority of the Senate which I'm optimistic we will do will continue to be able to confirm\nJudges like judge Kavanaugh Judge Gorsuch and the other uh eighty two federal judges are we've confirmed so far right but I I'm I'm traveling to uh to Dallas a on Thursday or Pete Sessions\nRace there is on the on the line on the bubble and then John Culberson in Houston John Carter\nIn uh in Williamson county where I just left right I'm all of these are very close races and so that's why it's so important that your listeners get out and vote in each of these congressional races because it's not just Ted Cruz is not just Greg Abbott\nIt's these down ballot races that could determine who is the next speaker of the house or in the house representatives in two thousand Nineteen\nSenator John Cornyn a couple of quick question senator of first of all walking Castro who is a district twenty ... a Democrat from\nI'm from the great city of San Antonio you know him you know his brother I mean this guy is a far left wing radical guy who just a few days ago I actually alleged that that Jared Kushner gave a hit list to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nAnd then the crown prince took action best way to show used dead when a U.S representative says something so stupid he's trying to back away from it now but when he says something so\nThe U.S representative says something so stupid he's tried to back away from it now but when he says something so stupid I mean is there anything that can be done legislatively in the house can be censured came I mean you don't say something like that that the president's son in Law Order the death of somebody\nBut I don't think it was an accident and I think it was probably premeditated unintentional but I Can't think of anything more reckless or a member of Congress decided then to accuse somebody\nOr something like that without any evidence whatsoever I'm\nIt it it's a I think it's a scratch\nWell and also the audio and then he said he didn't say it but we've all seen the video he definitely set it\nYeah well it's it's I unfortunately this was one of those political issues that I think is going to be decided at the at the ballot box you know that's probably not a whole lot to anybody could do I'm beyond that but I certainly would encourage people to to ah remember of this and I'm and\nI'm the way they think is appropriate you know in this race that's just not something that ought to be rewarded with the support\nI couldn't agree more now the last thing has to be the thing that everybody's keeping an eye on this caravan of two thousand to five thousand people heading north I'm\nA these are not people who either are looking for or need political asylum when their question these are people that say we just want to get a different job a better job maybe a better life and I get that I mean everybody wants a better job better life but that's not somebody who gets political asylum generally speaking our friends who I actually go aren't doing as much as I think they possibly can do\nAnd this also you're not going to like send out a Twitter message to everybody in Honduras hail its head north this is obviously something that was that that was put together by somebody on the left there's video out there that I've seen where people are handing money to those who are getting ready to jump onto this caravan of his horde of people\nDon't what can be done I mean we can't have four thousand five thousand people break from our border illegally and all claim asylum at the same time what can we actually do\nWell I I think the president is right that this essentially you would be tantamount to an invasion\nOf the United states and the president has authorities as commander in chief to repel any invasion of the country\nYou know this this is what I think again you mentioned uh the left over playing their hand on cap and all this is another example of that I Believe\nWe're all sympathetic to people who who would like to immigrate to the United states for a better life right but we don't believe that they should jump ahead of line the line of people who are doing it awfully and and waiting in line\nAnd so this is another example kind of a mob controlling our orders in our policies and we we cannot let them limb uh there is a legal way for people to get their case heard before an immigration judge and it ought to be handled that way\nBut I like the way Senator Cruz mentioned it I think there was that the first the debate you had with baked or work he said he said the difference between ... so working me is I Believe in legal immigration not illegal immigration exactly and this seems to be encouraging illegal\nImmigration a senator I bug that you've been an amazing job with a juicy under the Judiciary Committee when it came to cabin on a thank you so much value or were you represent our state and really\nDo it it was amazing yesterday you see you speaking in front of that horde of very excited to Republicans conservatives Texans in Houston great job uh I've always appreciate jump banks\nThank you Joe good to be with you back\nAfter this will be Joe ...

of public health and the station\n\n\n\nTo John ... in the early because of the hill and Fox News discussing the economy but not right in the election\nWe're waiting for the results of the house and Senate for the new year this segment\nOf the global business reporters brought you buy the republic of Azerbaijan from food energy to my knowledge economy the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea but see ... based in as a region well worth exploring list\nThe uh foreign affairs matter that's on the television right now constantly is the caravan coming from Central America\nIf Donald Trump didn't invent this I'm beginning to think that the that haven't has gone Republican that that that that that there's the reds branding for out across the whole holy ...\nBecause it is everything he talked about in the twenty sixteen campaign that took the Republican Party by storm and overwhelmed his rivals his response was a strong border and the wall\nThe caravan is a puzzle to me why is there where it's coming the men look very healthy very well dressed dominant male of working age and they are marching through Mexico not seeking refuge in Mexico which offers to them asylum if they're\nFearful of conditions in their own countries Honduras Guatemala or El Salvador and they're marching toward the border Donald Trump doesn't have any have to do anything more than stand there and say witness I Will stop this\nHonestly I think that's true because I think every American should be offended by the goal of these people who are marching towards the United states who know fill well uh that they are breaking all kinds of ...\nThe states who know filled well ah that they are breaking all kinds of laws that they try to come into the United states but just assuming that we are\nIn effect and able to stop\nThe flow we have no policies in place to really prevent them from coming into the country and I have to say if there is one issue where Congress has utterly failed the American people this is it and for Donald Trump to of latched onto this in two thousand sixteen was a master stroke\nNot because he wants it to be a problem but because it is a problem and it needs to be fixed and by the way this is a very good time for Republicans to remind people that Trump made a proposal as you remember\nHe had a several step proposal on the table or to take care of the dreamers to redo\nOur diversity of lottery program various other things increase the border security et cetera which most Americans agreed with almost every segment of it\nIn a in terms of polling response showed that people yes I think that people only should be allowed to come into the country if they can provide for themselves so that we shouldn't be\nA ... you know careless if you will with opening our borders so this is something where he really is on the high ground up the Democrats if you recall wouldn't even talk about it in fact they just didn't show with a meeting that was supposed to address immigration reform they don't want immigration reform and I think\nHispanics are beginning to get the picture that this is something where they are being used as a political football\nOr it has nothing to do with the morality of the situation Democrats simply like having this issue because they think Republicans get hung out to dry on it but guess what\nThis caravan as you well point out has really thrown that calculation overboard\nA it has been stirred up an organized by left wing agitator Z in Central America it's being funded by those politicians and activists and it is it has a very single sole purpose which is to embarrass the United states\nOr you know what it is embarrassing to the United states but not in the way they had hoped it's really embarrassing to Congress and a lack of laws and the Democrats who basically blink and pretend nothing bad is happening this should not be allowed\nAnd by the way it's not the first time when an American president was buffet by one of these assaults on our border we all remember\nA ... in a two thousand twelve I think it was when you had that surge across the border during Obama's presidency and Americans were horrified and all of us on all the polling on immigration reform went very hard nosed and sort of\nBack fired for President Obama because people held him accountable for not fixing it\nAh I think this as a as you say a godsend to Republicans although it really is not a godsend to anyone 'cause it's a shameful uh it it sort of you know evidence of the fact that we pretend to be a rule of law nation but in this one instance we are not\nIt's taken the breath out of the Democratic tactic locally to talk health care health care health care the novel grown poll for the sixty six districts I'm told this is Wall Street journal NBC\nIs now even if not favoring the Republicans as opposed to the national generic where the over vote ways in and that gives the advantage to the Democrats but we're only talking about the districts that are read for now but went from Mrs Clinton those are the sixty six battleground the Senate Liz that caravan\nDefinitely is going to influence the Texas Senate race the Arizona Senate race in Nevada Senate race\nThe Montana's Senate race and the Missouri Senate race in the Tennessee Senate race all of those states struggle with illegal immigrants and the lack of ... ... immigration reform and all of those states were at issue for the Democrats do other hold or pick up and they're now moving away from the Democrats\n[noise] yeah I think that's a and I totally agree with you I think that it's dumped somebody is definitely favoring Republican candidates and by the way it's not all a Democrats who are trying to hold on to seats we had a very tight race surprisingly in Texas with Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke so there are\nSome contests where this is going to have an impact\nI'm from ... in favor of Republicans who are trying to hold onto their seats and by the way it follows on the heels of the cabinet right disgrace which also a favorite Republican senators because Democrats really kind of torch their opportunity to\nShow a reasonable this but I think American voters would appreciate a\nBy failing to vote for a for Kavanaugh so they've had kind of two black guys here in a row uh and you know I think going out asking Americans to vote for you when you're ... you know you're kind of um [noise]\nNot standing up for the things that most Americans think are important I think that's a pretty tough ask and I think they're going to find that on on November ...\nPeak for the columnist for the hill and for Fox News this segment of the global business report brought you by the Republican ... from food energy to a knowledge economy the Republicans ... and the Caspian Sea bass in this region well worth exploring I'm John bachelor [noise]\n\nTaking action against Saudi Arabia I leave ... Fox News us announcing its revoking visas against Saudi nationals tied to the killing of journalists them all to show game\nVery core this was not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence restrict your show that you are journalist through violence we continue to maintain a strong partnership with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia neither the president ... happy with this situation\nSecretary's day my palm payout today President Trump said he is meeting with top officials tomorrow to discuss the findings of their investigation into cars show that the Saudi king has denied any involvement in the death\nDespite warnings from the Trump Administration that the military will be sent to the border a caravan of thousands of migrants mostly from central and South America continues to make its way to the southern border\nTraveling through the United states and have any assets that they have in the United states frozen now if you're at the you know stop number three in the study you know hit team\nThen chances are that doesn't affect you at all because you're not going to come to the United states anyway and you probably don't have big bank accounts or investments in the United states if you met ... insult on Solomon rather than well that's a very big deal\nOr so the question really will be whether they these Magnitsky Act sanctions are applied to just the people on the ground who actually did the killing or are they applied to the people who gave the order and who those people are will be a crucial pizza\nJosh ... because the leaders of nations give orders that lead to death routinely by their gunman by their by their um operators by their military is there a distinction here\nThat is a available to the crown prince or to Riyadh to solve this in some legal fashion could they declare car show G\nTo have been a an enemy actor or an illegal combatant that this is twisted several administrations here ever since the war on terror started\nYou know well the fact that the crown prince is also the fact that we're headed for the military means that he has quote unquote command responsibility which means that even the act performed by the forces under his control whether or not he had premeditated knowledge he's responsible for those that right now you can get could he\nStrike some sort of deal whereby he was exonerated that's always possible but under the law if implemented a to the letter or he's as guilty as the person who we'll just on so\nIsn't that true for any leader of state if it leads to a a death I'm thinking of the the debates we've had about drone strikes in the middle east these last Eighteen years is is different than a drone strikes that goes awry and leads to the death of an innocent\nThere are different rules for what happens in a war zone it declared a conflict now drone strikes perpetrated by the United states is not always been in those words no they haven't yet there's ... there's a there's a case to be made and often the only difference between more crimes that get prosecuted and war crimes that go unanswered is the will of the international human rights\nCommunity to select the particular case based on the fact that is particularly egregious or violates a norm that the international community whole theory that's why you see prosecutions for chemical weapons even though they are relatively\nUh you know the killing less people than carpet bomb a now in the case of showed it violates a couple of norms right wind up with a you know the the ability of a free press to operate in a free society to the killing of a U.S resident\nWas three us for US citizen children\nIn in ... in a NATO country\nYou know that is what makes this case new and different and interesting and where's the of the attention of some of these uh uh particularly uh uh extravagant ... a legal in justice and accountability measures now that doesn't mean that\nThat's going to happen but to be strict about it yes you could prosecute every war crime in every crime against humanity all the way up to the top and ... you would be well within the law to do so\nJosh broken for global opinions for

I'm a poet and we're reviewing our five years quickly because there's a new book more with Russia [noise] the book is\nPublished the uh the criticism that he provided to augment our conversation which was recorded as a podcast and made available on the nation dot com as well as my website and globally I mean for heaven's sakes they're all eventually everywhere in the ether forever\nOr I tuned in of course and all the other aggregators for five years but Steve has taken his right off of each week's conversation and arrange them in a book style we've gone quickly through ... too and Syria because we now we come to win it grew into when NATO conflict and that was in twenty sixteen\nBecause of the concerns the fears of Eastern Europe\nThat Russia having gobbled up half of Ukraine was going to turn its attention to the\nRussian frontier and the NATO\nTroops and the NATO commanders cooperated in this fear Steve because they injected in the idea\nThat Russia was an aggressor and the little green men could be in Lafayette just as easily as\nAs they could be in Poland and since then there's been nothing but escalation in Europe so we started in Ukraine we spread to Syria than we spread to Eastern Europe and now Steve because of the exercise that Russia just ran with China in the in the far east of Siberia we have a true global ... global conflict\nWith Russia and China on one side and the United states and NATO and the other in these five years\nYes and it's amazing to me John not amazing but it's striking that as I finished the book how many of the subjects we discussed for five years ago\nYou would say it's history and it is history\nBut it's still front page news today a in Ukraine for example it's still said was shut off the fall of the government there and brought the pro American government\nThe power in a country that's part of Russia's common Ukrainian civilization right on the border of Russia were one of those famous snipers remember that John in February Twenty one\nBill on solved fame\nAnd say well no actually not I mean newspapers still say that the president of Ukraine at the time ... would soon be deposed and fleet of Russia has sent snipers to kill as a point on this on my ... square but all the evidence now in\nIs that it wasn't on the cold which but his very right wing even neo Nazi enemies who are the snipers now the reason that's important is that those people\nWho sent the snipers neo Nazis have grown into a major force in Ukraine Today and yet we back the government of Ukraine so this is another theme of the book I mean are we comfortable we're Americans backing a government that has a bad a\nReally the largest fascist movement in Europe today an arm in arm battalion I was all with thirty thousand fighters\nWell see we just rent of NATO exercise in western Ukraine with the as off battalion now part of the Ukraine military so yeah of clear we're comfortable we're networking\nYou know I I just want to get myself one further piece of a promo promotion the lake writer Gore Vidal's all uh many years ago when I was writing a column about Russia for the nation magazine said that I was part of an early journalistic alert system\nThat is I call attention to things that people weren't paying attention to I think that that's one that that's been one important for me I'm doing this broadcast with your weekly is that you and I have been able to talk about things were working behind the news that are very important\nThat are going to shake and when I read what we've discussed and what I've written up now in the book\nI'm pleased and a kind of negative way because I Wish a lot of these things hadn't happened but we were we began to trace in late to Thirteen when Ukrainian crisis you opted all the way through almost last week have been the right things to focus\nStop their professor prep for the book is war with Russia question mark Stephen F Cohen when we come back we're going to plunge immediately into nuclear conflict on John ... this is the John ...\nTaking action against Saudi Arabia I'm Lisa like Sarah Fox news thee was announcing its revoking visas against Saudi nationals tied to the killing of journalists them all to shell game making\nVery clear that the United states does not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence Mr ... a journalist through violence we continue to maintain a strong partnership with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia neither the president nor I Am happy with this situation\nSecretary said my palm town today President Trump said he is meeting with top officials tomorrow to discuss the findings of their investigation into his show is that the Saudi king has denied any involvement in the death\nDespite warnings from the Trump Administration that the military will be sent to the border caravan of thousands of migrants mostly from central and South America continues to make its way to the southern border\nThat truly had been negotiated and signed in Nineteen Seventy two [laughter] ... ballistic missile treaty and it was absolutely crucial to everybody's security the cause is prohibited\nAny country in specifically the United states the Soviet Union and Russia from the clawing missile defense installations\nWhich meant what let's go back to what was called mad what kept the new therapies ever since the beginning of the atomic age was this doctrine of mutual assured destruction that if one side attack the other\nIn an attempt to destroy it ... itself would be attacked and destroy and that little ... madness could lead to this or in an accident kept either side from protecting itself from a retaliatory strike so when Bush left it he open the door to a\nProfound revision isn't that eventually undermine this intermediate range tree\nAnd the Russians began when they saw what was going on to develop a counter or they began violating the treaty I whether they deploy these missiles or not is open question but they certainly develop them and they tested or they haven't deployed them show the United states by doing that now\nRemember something else happened\nWhen the United states violated another agreement want it made with Gorbachev that it would not move NATO eastward toward Russia when NATO began to expand Russia's borders and today John we all know we're right on Russia's borders NATO is\nThe missile defense installations which we are now being implemented because Bush has left the treaty prohibiting then became a NATO project where NATO went missile defense with some of the result is\nAnd I'll get to the end of this point but I think it's very important the result is today as we talk Russia is ran by American NATO missile defense installations so you say so what how does that relate to what Trump has died and it's because the Russians have clay\nAnd America nuclear scientists who are independent such as professor Theodore postal at MIT have agreed that these missile defense installations can fire\nIntermediate range missiles that is there not only defensive installations they are often ...\nSo we've been building their capacity to fire cruise missiles as they were called which have been banned\nFor almost a decade now and the Russians have complained bitterly and we have not responded so we have a situation so when the Russians began to respond they probably violated the treaty but they were reacting to us\nAnd and the ages system that we moved on his shoulder just yes actually\nRight exactly and even though the the INS ban land base missiles the ages just complicate it\nA lot of them are on ships but they are in fact land based develop missiles cut on those ships they it's blurred the distinction between seeing land oh I think it's fair to say\nAnd you might get on somebody and get somebody on like an ally of John ... who says my narratives not correct but I'll leave it to be that as his true with the history of the new Cold War we have mine mostly or\nYou know within ten in mine done profoundly unwise things in regard to Russia to which Russia has reacted\nAnd we see what it leads to because of this treaty this act of nuclear abolition is and was symbolically and historically of enormous importance now maybe it'll be say\nThere are six months you have to get noticed six months in advance and maybe that's a blow off by Trump to get the Russians to do something a Trump ... you're gonna meet where John and I am a member\nEleven in Paris for this for the commemoration of one hundred years since the armistice end of the gun fell silent and November eleventh\nNineteen and maybe they're going to and I think we're supposed to meet again in Argentina November sidelines of the G ... if they do meet maybe there's a secret diplomacy underwater stare saved I doesn't look that now I have a quote\nHere from the Institute of us and Canadian studies a Segway Rogoff a home with a Russian has links to Russia oh\nHe's he is there a guy on America I Know she\nOr he will leave sat here is that leaving the INS could bring the whole structure of arms control crashing down now that that's ... that's n speculative late but it's been my experience these five years that escalation works this way if something can happen and go wrong it does happen and goes wrong that's escalation\nSo what happens after the ins and is that the start doesn't get extended and that's all that's left there is nothing else after dark\n[noise] well I could I mean not to tell my book again but the thesis of the book is that this new Cold War is more dangerous than the proceeding one so during the proceeding Cold War we and the Soviet Union inactive all sorts of measures to keep us safe\nIncluding these nuclear uh weapons or restrain regulation agreements now they're being dismantled oh so if we have a new nuclear war without the safeguards that protected is\nDuring the Cold War I didn't mean to say nuclear while we have a new Cold War without the safeguards that protected us from nuclear war we're in the greatest danger John but now what's gonna happen now I\nThere's a politics to this is going to come into play uh there's going to be political forces in the United states\nJust a moment we're going to add to politics held it ... you switch from military to ... ... oh you did a very smoothly there so you caught me when I ...

calls in from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenn the good evening\nThey chew first I like to uh agree with President Trump would draw for the treaty and they're also general comments about John Bull by the national security stood my comment is is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties and I was approaching to this so cruel\nThis is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties and I was approaching to missile proven in Germany they say\nThat the European Union is going to allow these intermediate range weapons that we may or may not produce there'll be put on their soil they scream bloody murder up all this with any of these\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly do but I you know there were huge raising a very very good point I don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow\nUh enter and medium range ground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory oh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article that we probably don't need necessarily\nTo develop a tit for tat weapon\nA there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate\nRange of weapons could include a an intermediate range weapon of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up violating type cruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do is\nMy preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good initial defense systems but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack\nAnd that certainly is not good enough for what we want to do I think\nIs all set with the Russians are doing here put a lot more money and a lot more time into perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided as a star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there\nIs nothing about the notion of a missile defense is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles at the speed of computers\nAnd uh the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like and it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this was not something that has any inherent impossibility

innovative ideas let's talk to a dog who calls that July ... from Pittsburgh Katie ... evening Doug welcome to the program\nHi Jim thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask the mayor about uh Pittsburgh gone through a similar answer measure to having industries feeling the biomedical on banking cetera um\nAnd it's doing well the reason is doing well however the city schools the Pittsburgh city schools struggle year after year your and your families are sending their students to the ... ... public school they'll go anywhere else private school\nA Catholic school charter schools et cetera ... how is the Oklahoma City public schools\nAre they going through the transformation of the economy in your city\nWell it's it's a little inconsistent certainly we're we're a little different in that we have twenty four school districts\nThey were were a little different in that we have\nTwenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City\nAnd so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four but the largest district as about forty percent of the population at the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo that means that the urban public school setting it's still it very much a stressful situation across the country in Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools um out all around you know that center part of the city and people have gravitated and that's part of the you\nKnow the sprawl issue that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kids and so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools and other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city\nBut I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they been\nWell most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are ... the I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nUm and um you know are my one of my granddaughters attempts at a charter school downtown and you know if it's run by a board of our business leaders um who you know kind of\nInsurance success and uh you know there's nothing magical about the about the model\nIt's not that they have a bigger budget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get the hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district a but they've taken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom\nSo you know and and that one instance things could be working better I I liked the idea that parents have choices\nUm and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYou know I I Know of course the your acquisition of the NBA thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the opening of the new stadium for the Oklahoma City red hot your AAA a baseball team are sports franchises a good way to enhance the city because I Know some\nSome urban areas have become disgusted with the exorbitant demands from most sports franchise owners\nWell it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is if you if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one\nIt is on a superficial level up a level of quality that she didn't have before and I'm not saying it should name this much but it does and and the fact that\nThat suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago in Los Angeles it and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent is who your sports teams play\nAnd there's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps our CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer some want a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job\nOn on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes a pop culture\nAnd a major league sports team makes you culturally relevant mingling Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players\nYou know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're offered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly um that sends a message that this is a good place to live\nUp in the I think that when sports starts to become tired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing one new facility after another new facility and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nBut we're coming up on a break here that that doesn't move here I'm going to finish your thought on sports teams in just a moment we'll be right

most Oklahomans are thrilled that United States is in more control of its energy future going forward that we've been burned and oil and gas industry is playing a major role in our economy\nUm but you know at some point their their technology is got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring up the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out a without causes the harm on all the rest is\nNow in the Oklahoma economy of course a a began a pretty much wants to uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven\nOr ... the Oklahoma economy has been tied with the energy for for many years is the the state's economy a skill that directly tied to

it's called me and it's tax revenues cyclical\nAre based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation on\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they've been baking and made them more efficient industry uh you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak of holes in the oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas on the ground it's more technology driven and they get more oil and gas that it was just go well used to ... um and so the results\nAnd they get more or less gas that it was to go well used to [noise] um and so the result of that as a more efficient\nModel a one bedroom pulleys fewer people but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future ... we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I think the only gas industries you know it's it's been a wonderful job in in creating a better resources for our country here in the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales

crossing over in Mexico or\nAre they crossing over the president says not so fast Justin duck on joins us right at the top of America Tonight with me cater lady from TOP Media news\nJust and it's very strange to see the seven thousand six thousand whatever the number is I don't know how anybody can count that it's not like ... style the Disneyland you're clicking people off but what's the latest from DC on that\nWell the president has really been in the early and on this record has made this the centerpiece of a lot of his public message in the past couple of days there's been a lot of discussion was from him about suspending foreign aid for Central American countries I couldn't do more to cover\nThreaten to the border threatened to use the military which is something that you've previously last year\nUse the military which is something that a previously last year when there was a similar situation to this\nUm but he is certainly doubling down and today he was pressed on a number of the statements he made a large degree his assertion that there are an unknown number of middle Easterners within the drone those people who are coming and he said that he has very good information to back that up\nBut when asked directly if he has proof he conceded that he does not have to take the ... the grain of salt you have to understand that this was\nComing up with about two weeks until the mid term elections this is certainly something that the president is really aiming for in terms of galvanizing his base and getting out political message across um but nevertheless it's something that does seem to be working at it is certainly get a lot of attention over here on the dollar\nBoy no kidding and when you say a lot of attention to the beltway and I said it across America I'm getting like an avalanche of emails\nAnd it and there's no doubt people are talking about this than what the impact will be on the elections and I saw something today where I guess it was rama manuals that it's going to be like a blue wave what are the Democrats night\n[noise] uh well it looks like it's going to be a comfortable democratic win at least in the house\nUm but you know we also had a lot of confidence before the twenty sixth grader lecture and then we all know how that\nEnded up turning out but you know historically the odds are on the side of the Democratic party\nUm typically in midterm election year as we speak easy a party in the White House lose the um if you recall and twenty town Obama had what he described as they ... when he lost the lower chamber there um but we certainly could be surprised when I was the message is changing we now see Republicans\nI'm adopting new measures growing interest trying to make this about cabinet are trying to make just about immigration I'm trying to make this middle class tax cuts which is something that the president has put forward\nUm lately but you know all of his rhetoric is coming up against the reality which is that if they lose the house this is going to make their political ambitions a lot harder and that's something that Larry Kudlow pretty much acknowledged today on the um you know from started the White House so it's hard to the west wing you\nHave offices that would chip in my friend any he said uh they had\nThree hundred chances to win the lottery so will somebody be crowned the billionaire solo will a group of people walk away with millions after taxes we don't know\nI mean will we get a chance if it's one person really ever even meet that billionaire four states give the winter's the option of remaining anonymous and there are some other measures winners take in states to conceal\nTheir identity 'cause you can imagine\nHow everybody would hit you up it's human nature if you won the lottery we don't know at this a point to make a million jackpot\nHas been growing since July group of California office workers one a lot of money in fact they won\nFive hundred and forty three million dollars but if no ticket matches the numbers the jackpot will grow to two billion on friday forty four states\nAs well as Washington DC in the U.S Virgin Islands are in the mega million\nJackpot area of course if you don't live in one of those areas you just go to a neighboring state and get it or yeah one of her friends to pick up the ticket do you trust that they would which the tickets on if you weren't going to see them until later in the week there have been lottery foibles\nWhere there's arguments there's been lawsuits yes yes yes yes yes indeed so pretty wild one point six billion is a whole lot of something something isn't it\n\nThe jackpot grows more people are interested in it and ... there's more pools to boost the odd but what's interesting is\nThe people who are odds makers say that doesn't really work\nThat just because of groups get together and you have two thousand people in the group and they pay ten bucks each buy tickets and then you go when that you've got this big thick Ava low and\nYou know have to go through all the numbers and go through all the kids then\nYou know how are you going to divide it and you know taxes taken out of the winning the final prizes up up up a statistician say nothing to sneeze at but the chances are still the same chances if there is a one and three hundred and two point six million chance of winning\nSo whether you purchase ten thousand tickets\nChance of winning so whether you purchase ten thousand tickets or one to winning percentage for making millions of still like nothing burger is still low\nIt as far as games of chance are concerned it absolutely is the lowest of low but you know what the what we know that isn't it about hey maybe yields somebody's got to win someone's going to win their tickets going to come up where's that ticket going to be\nSo I think lottery fever and the discussion over it will continue and then there's the question of will we know a you know ... when we know somebody has it will know where that ticket came from\nAnd that makes it more interesting because then people try to figure it out\nI had the others say to me well you know a lot of places in fact in most places you would have cameras so if they came to my establishment and they said okay well they you got the ticket here she would get money for that\nCouldn't we just go back and look at the feed and can you kind of time stamped and figure out who that possibly could be [laughter]\nI guess I don't know by the way hurricane willow while some people worried about the lottery hurricane Willa smashed into Mexico's west central coast hundred and twenty mile an hour with cats three\nBriefly reached cats for five rather and it happened at about nine o'clock near either to depose\nA ... about fifty miles south east of the popular resort city of Moffat blonde\nAnd so not good because they're talking about six to twelve inches of rain and the rain can be the flooding and we've already seen some flooding I've seen some of the a\nPhotograph from ... San Lucas and I used to go to carbo and it's pretty flooded you know some people have changed flight\nAnd people are tracking the storm who hope it weekends and then get into their Mexican vacations if they're going to uh Mexico so it uh it looks\nAt you know again it's the it's what we've seen with these hurricanes\nIf the winds are really brutal then you see the shifting of the houses and the house and being ripped up\nAnd it if it's a different in a different direction it's more about the flooding of course you see the damp and houses a where it's up to maybe the porch and people walking in the streets\nAnd some of you have quite a bit to say about that in the mail bag 'cause you've seen the devastation from Michael you've seen the devastation in some areas\nAnd um you know there is\nTime with the hurricanes sometimes but it's not always so easy to scramble and get out and then when you get trapped and you're playing chicken with wins or with the flooding it becomes even more deadly a lotta times is the aftermath\nThat is so so bloody tough it coming up on the show to a big reminder the red Sox and the Dodgers if you like baseball game one of the world series so who ultimately\nWon this game one team cracked it open in the late innings I'll tell you who that was and what happened there\nAlso the Dallas Cowboys make it official and they pick up a mark Cooper but they trade away a top pick will he be worth it they need some targets so I think he will death than that lay definitely definitely be worth it and then\nI'm going to talk about some of the uh concussions settlements because many of you actually have sent me some stories about concussions and asking me what I thought what the league was doing meaning the NFL and we'll talk about those two as um\nYou know as as well if we look at money on the open market not the gambling kind if we look at Wall Street the Dow was down again the Aztec within the U.S and he was down so what kind of\nScary October are we going to see for these stocks\nWell caterpillar had some bad losses\nAnd there are some forecast for economic earnings for some of these big blue chip companies to plunge\nSo there's risk associated with that you know the corporate earnings like caterpillar and three and that certainly panicked investors a little bit because they thought of that is pretty daddy but um\nYou know are there corrections to some of the peaks so Tuesdays had some wild wings and crazy losses the S. and P. stock index closed six point five percent below it September all time high the Dow was six point one percent off it's October third record\nWall Street hoping hoping hoping that strong quarterly earnings will provide that bounce back on the market but it hasn't happened yet there are signs that it should make a sharp\nTurn left for now we just got to call it even how's that\nWe come back though were hit in the mail bag\nMillennia view sending me or thoughts including Jeff amber [noise]\nWe'll get to those on the flip side [noise]\nThanks for tuned in in ... and be the case of Lenny America Tonight [noise]\nOne of radio\nABC News I'm Dave Pecker a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants traveling through Mexico making their way towards the U.S border more than Fifteen hundred miles away despite President Trump saying he'll call up and military to prevent their entry into the U.S ABC's met ... been traveling with the caravan and shellfish Mexico on the\nGround there scrounging for food it's things here the ... nearly unbearable nearly throughout the entirety of a cap and show one does wonder how much longer they can keep it up\nYou know a tropical storm with winds just forty five miles an hour but moving quickly across Mexico and we'll bring heavy rain to Texas later today so we're made landfall last evening as a category three hurricane of viral outbreak but experts say shouldn't be deadly has killed six children in New Jersey and a dozen more sick\nI think it's the apple watch though that people are buzzing about the iPhones that times I've seen people with outdated iPhones they're not in the sixes even toward not even in the seven but it's the watch that people want\nBecause you know now it has healthcare in it\nIt's got an exercise tracking time peas there's all kinds of features to it the apple watch series for and they're saying that they believe it even overshadows the new iPhone because of how small it is ...\nAnd if you take a pill\nThey'll watch can detect that too if you're unresponsive after a fall the watch can some of the emergency assistance so there's things that can help you certainly for older people that can help them\nAnd the idea is is just a notch above everything it can get your message is look at your messages that way I don't know why I don't have any interest in the apple watch I get it though I've met more people that have had the have the apple watch that I've ever met all those\nBarely still new I guess we could say that I've ever met run into whatever before\nThere is absolutely abuzz not just in my backyard your backyard cousins backyard your best friends back I mean\nIt it is or something about the watch now and I wonder if that takes over some of the sales and the future that's more about that than it is about the phone itself that is suddenly switches\nAnd we go in a much different directions I I think it could happen\nBased on and I'm basing this\nOn what I'm saying the people I Know when I go to conventions I look around and boy everybody has a or a lot of people have the the Apple iPhone\n... what was going on with Netflix I got this one from Brian who says Kate I Know you talk about branding when you speak and you've mentioned before about Netflix versus blockbuster and what idiots blockbuster was but did you happen to see that uh there's two billion\nThat they've had to borrow what's up with that\nOr they unstable or are they having problems\n[noise] um\nYou know it's a good question because I was watching the stocks go down a little bit but not very much\nAnd I guess the the debt isn't a surprise to some who monitor stocks like this one because that's what Netflix does they usually have a negative cash\nFlow that's their model because they burn cash\nSo they have to raise capital to fund their content spending is almost like they're eating their own there are a victim of their own truth successes because the original content streamed on demand is so popular it's attracting copycat\nSo they've got to spend a lot of money to keep up with Amazon CBS all access HBO\nHulu\nAnd they have to replenish what they're losing from studios like Disney\nAnd Warner Brothers because they're going to have their own services that can directly compete with Netflix so if Netflix wants to stream certain things\nThey won't have the option to do that on Netflix any of the Disney for Warner Brothers things they'll have to get some other\nOne of those you know that's a good one or brothers or does need to be able to do it and you know how much money they're ripping through\nTheir ripping through this is a crazy amount of money three billion dollars a year so great that you throw that out to me because I really I have talked about Netflix\nIf you don't know the story when I've talked about branding when when I'm Out on the road speaking and I'm Talking about you know what your while the wild to me is when you really miss the boat and blockbuster\nThey cornered the market remember the good old days when it was like ... getting a car and we got to get that first run movie when I read it never going to get a bunch of candy and popcorn and come back with a movie night we've slipped through the door and we're in line and this poor people\nThat have to wait for the next time it's back in that movie the first run movies [noise]\nBut then there was a brilliant the Netflix blockbuster could've own that Netflix went to

Berman says the result is a patchwork of experiments across the country working out the kinks of a love the idea in real time amid both storing praise and intense criticism Jillian what's happening\nOver the past you know ten or so years\nLocal communities states and others across the country have been experimenting with providing students with tuition free college and the idea kind of got a boost job with the presidential elections that we saw Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton talk a lot about different ways that they could potentially may call it a college free\nAll right so given example or two of who is trying to watch\nSo states like Tennessee are you know arguing programs where they make community college free to you know to students in their states [laughter]\nUm and the idea behind those kind of state level programs as you know it's a little bit more about workforce development in Tennessee they were like we need to attract more companies here to talk more companies here we need college educated workers how are we going to get them we're going to make college easier to pay for\n'em and then when you know local communities that have these programs so the most famous example is in Kalamazoo, Michigan where a group of anonymous donors\nI said and two thousand five\nYou know everybody who graduates basically from about what I call and Kalamazoo or going to pay for them to go to college in Michigan and the idea behind those programs that if you give the community free college kind of as an incentive and other organizations that\nTo make it to that you can take advantage of it to the public high school to get better a nonprofit you know do more to offer after school tutoring it sort of the community rallies together to prepare these students\nUm for school and that's better for the community and now they're also individual schools that are you know sort of making some kind of tuition free promise for certain students to say if you come from a family making less than ... you can come here for ...\nSpeaking with mark it watch personal finance reporter Jillian Berman she's written a piece titled here's what it would take to make college tuition free\nOr at least a couple of these programs are maybe most of them it does seem like the organizers are having to hit up a lot of donors are gonna getting some of the bigger companies around the area to chip in\nThat you know that's kind of one of the reasons why advocates of these things like\nThe idea of the federal government doing it and because then they can [noise] you know that the funding is a little less precarious but yeah especially on a lot of community college systems are starting to offer these programs and at that level you know community colleges and don't have that as sort of the huge fundraising arms of other\nColleges so it's really you know they're really like capping donors repeatedly and you know they're trying to get corporations that kind of be sustaining donors for these programs that it can be hard and if you you know promised students that you're going to do that you started ... deliver on it\nOr yeah it is just an evil funny I mean is that the phrase here going forward in terms of most tabs for these programs to continue and thrive\nSo that's really important in Tennessee they did an interesting thing where they took the lottery finds and basically um play some of that trust and then invest it and I'm so you know the weight that had a program is pretty much going to be found in perpetuity they won't have a problem\nWith Jillian it's

[noise]\nSo yeah as you say the OTC pie as one of those more a relatively obscure Labor Department offices not many folks know much about it um but they've got a big role sort of as the pay share of a particularly in the tech sector or because they enforce a pair of executive orders that banned discrimination by contractors\nAnd these days or the federal contracting space includes pretty much all of the big companies you can think of including a wide range of tech sector firms um we're talking our our story is about a Microsoft investigation but they've also been looking into Google\nCisco oracle talents here um they had a very bad uh five million dollar settlement with a state street recently so this is a small office that not a lot of folks know about but certainly has a lot of\nPower okay now as you can ... as you could hear the the room just died down in silence when you started to speak Chris and they want to know\nWhat the Labor Department do about a deal that was nearly completed this goes back to something that happened in July\nSo a C. C. P. investigators as part of a random audits out found what they said was evidence showing that Microsoft had discriminated against women both in pay and in passing them over for a promotion\nUm and usually as part of that investigation the next thing they do is they should notice violation and then started talking to the company about how to resolve the thing without going to court\nThat's what happened here oh let's see cp reached what they thought was a deal Microsoft but they had a deal and at the last minute in July idea well came back to them and said oh by the way\nYou know we're not going to do this and so the official word from the Labor Department was that oh FCC Pete it not have the authority that they needed to go through the solicitor um but what we know from sources is that actual actually labor secretary\nSolicitor um but what we know from sources is that actual actually labor secretary or Alex ... says stepped in and he thought that this was just a too good of a deal for Microsoft letting them off\nLike you know I I went and I looked at Cal Tech being on the west coast a million to leave school I mean they give you an idea of folks the range of the SAT math score of entering freshmen to Cal Tech is between a hundred and eight hundred which is all you got to know and of course you know fabulous enroll rate in that\nForty six percent women fifty four percent men I would've guessed twenty five percent women so it's moving in the right direction is this litigation in complained\nAbout getting more women into engineering at tech companies or is is that once they're in they're discriminated against those are two different things isn't it\nIt's an interesting question we've seen in the Google case in particular they're still fighting over what sort of information you can get from Google but the oil has said that they've already found widespread discrimination earlier and they say it's because of a history and so Google is asking folks when they come in what what what are you making right now\nAnd so women in the tech sector who have been discriminated against in the past with lower pay rates are then it's been baked in\nA lot of interesting\nCrazy Caruso for thank you so much for an update on really a serious thing the Celtic good morning out an all the engineering school's coast to coast is just great the admit rates eight percent which I think means Ninety two percent or rejected Roman class for the class of two thousand Twenty one two hundred and thirty six\nTimes article about Willie rationale the friend of mine who writes for the times you know great local reporter um he's reporting for the times today says the federal authorities believe the explosive device found in the mail box at the home of George Soros\nUh

I I I guess there'll be another day of a president going after the head of the central bank at some point this reaches somewhat of a critical mass or when you're there\nTo help or not um I think we're not there yet what worries me is that um some people have debated whether or not it's worse when an administration goes after\nA central banker from within the ministry ration or publicly well we know historically it when they actually succeeded to do it it has been through public means actually the Nixon administration threatened\nTo burn by planting a story in the newspaper that day and got him to acquiesce and easy to pour the Nineteen Seventy two elections which contributed to stagflation so we do know that ... can have an impact that's not something we wanted to have\nOn certainly we've already seen Volcker is remarks about how the Reagan Administration was pressuring him an interest rate that and he wasn't going to raise interest rates anyway so it worked to his advantage I think what's important is\nThat we don't get too much perception that the um administration could influence industry that's where the critical issue is is because much of that power is actually in the perception of its independence\nAnd not um and it's actual action there's as much perception is reality of rate hikes the effects of it and I think that's very important\n... why is anybody surprised particularly coming from President Donald Trump\nI wouldn't imagine people are surprised and hopefully that means that you know much like other things that we hear noise out there\nFor a minute ministry and we often discount it when it comes to financial markets at that we hope happens\nThat the reality is that we know that action can become policy I'm In a trade or we are in a trade war with China that's doesn't seem to be going away\nHopefully we will see the meeting was she and the president go more productively and back off and get China to acquiesce and some of the things we like them to do without going into full blown trade war in January\nBut these are things you know unfortunately\nIt's not clear when things that noise should be paid attention to and when it shouldn't they\nOnly know that the president can't fire a Federal Reserve chairman and the Federal Reserve has a long history of being independent it's also important to remind people that this rate hike may I say ... cycle started in December twenty fifth again it goes back to the Obama era that the economy was already for me now for the fed to raise rates and I think it's really important for\nCertainly your audience knows it's already but it's important to remember that the fed raising rates as an affirmation of the economy string [laughter] not as a means to kill the economy\nSo is this a political move on the part of the president of the head of the mid term elections\nWell you know what I mean who knows I mean I Can't judge that um it probably is is it all all people in politics are political by definition I Would assume I think more important issue to\nAll all people in politics are political by definition I Would assume I think more important issue to focus on is what is likely to do just that it's going to react to the data and this is going to raise rates again in December I\nThink very likely I'd put it Ninety eight percent chance on that a crane barring some major class in the

incidence which they believe may be connected to the pipe bomb that was found in the mailbox a billionaire and George Soros earlier in the week\nAnd another suspicious package address the White House is intercepted or reports say federal authorities say they're investigating a possible explosive device that was the trust of the White House\nAfter and was fly to an intercepted at joint base falling in Washington DC\nOfficials say the device with similar to the one sent to the homes of George Soros the Clintons and the Obamas for now getting conflicting reports on that but for more clarification we are going to send it over to\nOne of America's emerald Robinson who is live outside town with more ... of course a busy day as lots of tension going on so we heard that there was\nA similar

declined to comment on specifically whether there was there was not a box intercepted at joint base or the ... there have been reports that there was one intercepted that besides the pipe bomb that was found and the other boxes that it off that contain projectiles\nHowever both the secret service and the White House not confirming that show like you said there is\nNot real clarification on whether that box existed or not but the White House and Dick confirmed that the Obamas and the Clintons vox address on it than the Clintons and cigarettes are the author confirming that by saying that neither party was at risk\nThat these boxes were intercepted during a routine screening that they do on these and we're at the male so fortunately there is ...\nIn that they do ah these and we're at the male so fortunately there are systems in place that keeps the terrible act from happening in fact that the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said out of comments saying that\nCondemning the action and saying that those who were found to be responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law to Westchester County\nThat since our earlier this week as we mentioned in explosive device was found out and George Soros as home in authority say that was likely hand delivered have authorities commented on how they suspected the packages were delivered to the Clintons Obama's and CNN Spiro\nOn the left have not that funny they just like I said and I said let's say it that they intercepted it during a routine screening if they didn't say perhaps how they got a hold of the package as if it came to regular mail otherwise hand delivered they're being very quiet about it that they continue to investigate it along with the FBI I'm sure\nWill sometimes with all the things we don't get a lot of details even after the fact that they keep these investigations are required but perhaps we'll have more details later today or later in the week in regards to exactly\nHow that situation came about Seventy\n\nAnd we're all do you set out details were really um are very limited right now do we know if all all day I came up at the same time with the Clintons the Obamas and seen engineer it seems like it was all happening at the same time I\nExplain that a little about how um how all this was found at the same time it's a [noise]\nSo it does seem like they have all of these occurred earlier in the week and it seems that there is a coordinated effort it's just too coincidental for it not to be however Secret Service just confirmed the Obama and the Clintons a little bit earlier today again we're still trying to find out more details they just come from the bottom of the Clintons\nOn this morning the existence of those packages do me a detailed

basically free tweeted the theme in front of vice president basically saying that this is unacceptable enough on investigation it's going to be under way\nOr the FBI is off of all and I'm trying to

set to unseat the incumbent Republican representative ... boom\nIn a debate earlier this month blooms challenger twenty nine year old Abby think thinking our are focused on blooms support of Trump's trade policies\nBut this administration decided to start a trade war crimes where that's not how you get something not\nKevin ... really is joining us now he has Bloomberg's chief Washington correspondent in a Bloomberg Ninety nine one studios in Washington Kevin it sounds like it's shaping up to be an interesting race\nAbsolutely recalling the Iowa first congressional district race creed more casualties were spot letting of race today leading up to the terms and as Abby Finkenauer the twenty nine year old upstart democratic candidate\nPointed out she's trying to make trade specifically the central issue of this race against what Republicans are saying privately is\nCongressman rod love he is the most vulnerable Republican uh that's what Republicans are saying are up for reelection this is ground zero for President Trump's trade war traits that call it what you want\nAnd it's home to Howard county this is the only county that voted for the former president Brock Obama by more than twenty points and the twenty twelve cycle and then swung completely the other way twenty points four years later\nGoing for it now president Donald Trump so how do you think an hour is is making the case that the trade policies of the Trump Administration are hurting Iowa farmers\nCongressman Blumenauer saying not so fast that that\nTwelve billion dollars worth of aid that was announced to the agricultural community by the USDA earlier this summer is going to lead to what Congress and bumps says\nIs Twenty years of agricultural prosperity the bottom line is this was neck and neck but now it seems to be trending toward\nCongressman blunt because of that justice Kavanaugh's confirmation so national\nPolitics really starting to trickle into the north eastern part of Iowa in rural Iowa\nAnd it looks like now a a big superPAC has come in to help out and tell us about that\nYes so essentially the superPAC as as really ... what he was once seen as as vulnerable and quite honestly uh Peter was was someone who was going to lose and now you have a situation where\nYou've got a ton of outside money pouring into the state and tries to come to the aid of a people that Congress bum again the confirmation of justice Cavanaugh a really a shifting the dynamics of this particular race or and you know it's Iowa senator Joni Ernst is the host of dull\nIowa Republican machine that has really come to his aid ah and and uh you know it's it's ground zero for trade worth\nThat much does ethanol figure into this race you\nKnow a great question and in fact this has been the ethanol industry has had\nA ... a win so to speak and senator Joni Ernst declaring that against the current EPA acting director wheeler or for the president who just visited Iowa as several weeks ago to announce a win for the ethanol industry with return in terms of a walking back some regulation from the Obama era as well as\nA really a loss for big oil so the president managing to to to kind of poke the oil industry in Texas but deliver a win for Iowa a on that front coupled with the USDA aid package that's beginning to make its way to Iowa farmers\nYou know that could lead to some support for Congress from but that said I think an hour the Democrat young impressive uh\nSupport for Congress above that said I think an hour the Democrats young impressive uh as as someone who is very deeply tied to the community uh comes from a union family so ah you know she's doing the deal retail politics should\n... should other Democrats and other in other races across the country or be watching this should should they be concerned here if you know that there is only a weather\nYet this this is about whether this is about whether in terms of how rural Democrats are going to be running race a state wide as well as nationally for the next cycle or or to to come yesterday we were we were talking about how Republicans are trying to capitalize on steel over you know Kennedy Catholic type of voters\nOr an and today we're focusing on on how are Democrats and if people like Abby Finkenauer or tried to make the case of how the president's trade policies are hurting farmers\nBut what's interesting we were talking about this before I got on there is that\nThey essentially a bowl of Congress to blow up and obviously gonna agree in the sense that uh Iowa farmers are getting hurt by by China\nOr they just disagree with presidents to do she ate in tactics but\nThey're going to you know they're not going to not take the money from USDA\nA so that's really a nuanced approach and it's where the president's personality is really on the ballot here at how he's negotiating and whether or not Congress would loan or can can effectively convince Iowa farmers just to stick with the president and that's how we used to go shooting against China\nAnd to trust the president ultimately I think that will be more of the referendum based upon my reporting and talked to experts on the ah the the us we have to election day less than two weeks\nOr thanks to Kevin really Bloomberg chief Washington correspondent from our number one studios in Washington coming up on the

[noise]\nIt's hard to say in the region I mean it could but on the flip side remember\nSome of these big tech names bombed and cute to notably Facebook and that's like and they barely caused a ripple overall market which raises a the bar for what they would have to do to turn on the market around if they're plunges didn't really drag the market down over all throughout the rest of the summer then even if they blew the doors off\nCould that really change anything probably not as for Tesla I've never seen any relationship between Tesla and anything else so that's\nProbably it is kind of on its own down then you have to\nBear in mind that a lot of the issues that have come up this already season and actually you are not new they go back to earlier this year don't affect the tech companies so much they don't have to worry about higher commodity costs or\nA higher interest rates the extent they have so much cash and a lot of cases doesn't even matter uh and and we can go on and on anything about transportation costs not an issue for them so you know in that sense they are somewhat isolated from the bigger picture when it comes to earnings\nAnd so I you know one of the things that I think we've all been reading about and and looking at in and discussing is this idea of what is the one thing that is is starting to to worry people we talked about earnings\nBut but I feel like they're these laundry list of of worries but nobody can really say well it's this\nIt's this thing and so is it all of it put together day\nWell you could argue that I mean a lot of what we're talking about here comes back to the same thing which is what's already grows and revenue growth going to look like a once the effects of last year's tax cuts kind of fade out you know what does that mean in terms of where U.S companies are headed\nAnd you know whether we're talking about commodities or labor transportation or interest rates with a dollar or some other things tower is notably a ... and

index I mean it has just down this curve downward slope for a while those Disney getting getting beat up I think this is a great economic indicator\nOh absolutely and you know we're used to housing being the center of attention and there is a good argument that just doesn't play the same role in this cycle that it has in the past on the flip side if you wanted to come up with an industry which is probably the most linked to fed policy housing would probably be one of them and you wonder if like at some point I Would say hey\nThe fed is really in theory hitting an industry that uh is pretty central so does this encourage the fed to say hey we may be kind of accomplishment we're kind of a a going\nFor things are slowing down absolutely Joe was until a markets editor for Bloomberg co host

for all the communities of district one central clover Dale ... city Greenville and Florence don't let Philip Pettis and the Montgomery swamp by your vote vote Dolan\nIndependent candidate November

break and breaking news you're not leave it what is\nBlake snowflake is here in New York City and talking to Cuomo on the streets of New York\nJeff snowflake that smells like live in in charge about two blocks from here I'm believable\nWell maybe it just happened to be stopping by and maybe wants to move to a state or you can actually win a seat in 'cause it's Arizona I think he's talking to his future colleagues can't wait to be a CNN contributor\nOh that may be what it is you never know what I Want everybody to know what CNN I've been through this\nI've been through all of it I've had you know I mean I can do I do I begin to tell the story about poor Elise how many of all she was quarantine for hours it was like nine hours was horrible horrible and somehow we got no liberal media coverage\nYou know I look at it it's not about the coverage because you know but look we just had three weeks ago three weeks ago we had rice and sent to Trump mad as re Haspel\nI don't remember any coverage now in the case of any of this there were lunatics I'm going to prove that we get back that I've been consistent I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today\nFrom liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence in the last month over the most serious issues or their supporters has been definitely will get to that and what's Thirteen Days away from the most important election mid term in our lifetimes [noise]\nFor over a decade money and just say Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush to joke we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with but it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe\nWith but it's just so typical\nThe rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical is seeing people that have been\nTone deaf in silent to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nHow many women have been confronted in restaurants movie theaters how many times as this happened with you know the chanting in the restaurants with with politicians in their wives even this weekend with McConnell\nHappened twice the Ted Cruz over a conspiracy TV MSNBC there just despicable insinuating the suspicious packages can be tied back to Trump himself and that the intended recipient have all been criticized by the president\nYou've gotta be kidding me\nIs this how twisted let's just take the rhetoric of\nOf who they are every day just last night alone I played a bunch of tapes of you know lower thirds of the president he's a liar he said this she's a lawyer fraud this\nI'm Sorry the president flat out by saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election it gets hot the lie he changes his story again except for going against what eventually\nThe president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid where officially and parents and in fact ...\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with outright false\nNot even trying to hide his lights in the morning just putting all out there spreading a lot of lines about non why is\nThis all you hear every single day from the mainstream media lies about why ... ... look this is every election season\nYou get it\nThat we did have an incident if you recall when Steve ... another's the shooting took place in the ball field\nAnd I actually I remember saying and I asked my step to go back and find out what did I say when we\nFound out that the gunman or the person responsible for the shooting that nearly killed Steve ...\nWas a Bernie Sanders supporters is what I said now I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters\nAre not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him so it's Ryan McCarthy\nAnd it's ... right and this individual this assailant that we are now getting the information on that you just shared by his own and Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to condemn it because he was a Sanders supporters supposedly what\nThey want but you know what that they do it I don't blame Bernie Sanders of course not they would say would blame us yes of course I'd have to do what I Want to say you know Rush Limbaugh and the radio in the in Oklahoma City bombing and you know they've got their ... up in a ...\nWell this is because these guys are convinced the left that by ratcheting up their rhetoric that\nThey can get away with it and they get a free pass nobody doesn't matter if they do it so here's what you have today right here in Washington DC\nAnd attempted assassination I Hope it's not and I'm praying that you know he's in as we know Sean he's in a very serious very very critical supported earlier that it was upgraded a critical condition upgraded from critical to good but he's been critical it's worth their while he\nWas in stable yeah stable condition you get the point of what I did back where you can't blame Bernie for that\n\nNor can you blame any conservative but we don't know what the motivation is just it's all conjecture and now it's being used as a political weapon to bludgeon\nTalk radio Fox and Trump it's just outrageous\n'cause that's not who we are ... what did I say yesterday about George Soros I won't play it again now but I said\nHey not this has to stop\nGeorge Soros spends millions of dollars paying groups to get me off the air\nWe that's not how we settled political differences\nYou know when the sun is out there apparently blaming Donald Trump Donald Trump does not responsible for packages that might have bombs and anthrax or rice in in it\nOr ...\nYou don't see why you know let me play Hillary Clinton today and Hillary Clinton just what a week ago I was just compare\nHer not criminal ... political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about her only from the Republican whom to\nRecognize and respect strength\nIs it time a\nDeep divisions\nAnd we have to have to do everything we everything we can bring our country to get together\nTo thought we weren't supposed to be several ... a week later\nUnless it an Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York\nAnd we must be simple where Americans All right that's not what he would say in a while back when he talked about conservatives that live in New York people like me listen\nProblems not me themselves or are they extreme right why\nWas it that they are because they are the extreme conservative stations to New York city and I was\nAt the end of the day we may have political differences but this is one country we're all Americans he pluribus unum out of many one\nAnd keeping the faith and the dialogue civil\nLaw is very very important and for elective leaders in many ways set the tone\nIs is specially important\nOh they're not New Yorkers there's no place in the state of the New York if you're pro life pro Second Amendment I happen\nTo be libertarian on issues involving sexuality so it's not my issue\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it\nGoing to tell you a little story so I had this and and\nWindow lived through this and when the you know we're still very great friends with the lease who worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things will really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her in Washington when we were last there right yep we just saw\nUm it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office at Fox right\nUh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over and the sad thing is and she was an isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even though it was just horrible for her and she was\nCordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us and we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nI and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about I mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah but I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't\nI mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWho's going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had gone kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people\nAt restaurants and attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nFor shows up at your house or spent on you or threaten you or follow you know I have had all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our ... our politicians safe wherever did\nThis is not a conservative in the sense\nThat maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it but\nThis rush to judgment we don't know one thing yet who's responsible\nI immediately that trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat ever say well the president says fake news are they are fake news no truth is ... words are very different than actions\nIt was like Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that ... that was incendiary to me I just but you know he's not responsible because not that supports him\nSo unbelievable they apocryphal see how many of you know how many reported the three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to the president and secretary of defense Mattis ... director ray and to our CIA director Gina Haspel\nThe chance like sixty six forty percent there's you liked what he

going to go up on all night unconstitutionally guaranteed that right um but I'm not guaranteed right sending bombs in the mail that illegal\nI totally agree with you but you're right you got it but not quite what got me tell you what we shouldn't have either\nUm as Sarah Sanders in her family want to sit down and eat dinner she's not working leave her alone it Pam Bondi wants to see a movie leave her alone if secretary Nielsen has them eating a private dinner and groups of people are running no matter the restaurant I don't want that either\nDon't want a secretary McConnell and his wife some guy banging part or dishonest tables throwing his food out either\nOr Ted Cruz being run out with his wife had a restaurant I don't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability um I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore either I'm sure you agree with me right\n[laughter] I mean I'm asking do you agree with that\n\nSimple question\nAnd there was no one answer is he hung up to harder question Craig you have thirty seconds Greg go\nAhead Greg real quick oh hey Sean great there has to listen to a big big on her um I was blessed enough to go to the rally\nYeah here in Houston and it was just amazing to hear President Trump speaking person a skinny so much hope because my sister brought my little nephew and a Thirteen year old kid hung on every single word that a President Trump had to say and you only read about that\nThis is their rhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened to the ball field in ... nearly lost his life\nUm and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters it turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that support him you know decided to become violence\nIt's outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been their silence has been destiny\nIn recent months and days\nOr anyway Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action and also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris\nKobach is back with us and uh he has penned a piece on them migraine caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas and expert\nAnd immigration and uh by the way it's been very successful and what he's doing and uh and uh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas who is a big win that you're pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you'd be a great governor um look I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated\nUnwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately um but if they in four weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush ... across that border as in as one we don't have any problem of choice we will have to arrest them\nThat will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens meanwhile you've got governors\nAh like a Governor Brown out in California giving more benefits so if if a federal and state response or the feds have to build the wall and they have to stop panning out the goodies\nWhich gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government\nThat they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling or incapable of doing so ah what should America's response be\nBut I think America's response that with the president has talked about what she's making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country why they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons\nOr to either harm us or the day you know but there's a friday the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is to protect his people in the president's made very clear and and the one thing I said the the other day to sell in China I Want to be clear your agree with me I Know Christ will agree as well don't temp Donald Trump\nTalked temp temp because he's warning that can government he's warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I just I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he named it there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse course\nLet me let me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people\nPeople that don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the age we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him nobody can vouch for anybody\nAnd it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people to allow people in and vetted no idea what their their point of view a worldview happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nAnd that's that's a very good point you know it'd be there's abundant evidence of terrorists using\nThe traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border could get into the United states going all the way back to before nine eleven\nAh people from countries where al ... was active now countries where I suspect active have used this this flow this Margaret close to blend in there's no question that that'll be the case again the other thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is\nI think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis to follow this for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here legally then in the two thousands they became co amnesty and they no longer want it to deport they wanted to grant amnesty eleven million plus year\nNow they're taking the position that we ... they are cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's\nThey want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous ... people before they're even here to become unlawfully present to the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump\n... let me switch gears to these packages the president said um he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror he said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages it appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down and the and the full force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do 'em both before that Shawn we've seen a lot leading up to this\nAnd wondering what
