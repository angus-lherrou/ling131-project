everybody out there we hope you have a very safe in and fun Halloween and don't forget\nI think the best place in my opinion for your pets at Halloween season is at home in a safe room not panic room but a neighbor said once you and you're listening to talk of pets we want to hear from you pick up the phone give us a call a four four\nRio five Seventy eight hundred eight four four three zero five seven eight zero zero if you want to get a copy of first aid basics rabbits and pocket best car right now and it's yours and these are good for the kids to read to show they've got these pets is very informational\nAid for for three o five Seventy eight hundred eight four four three zero five seven eight zero zero you're listening to\nTalk and pets have you always\nSo it's so important to do your research a lot of people I think adopt rabbits for small kids because they think small kids' fault pet but rabbits are actually quite animals everything preys on a rabbits so you know a toddler running after a bunny is actually very frightening to that rabbit\nAnd one of the um injuries I mentioned in the ... birthday book is about broken bones and back and that can happen very often 'cause you know kids are even if they don't\nWant to cuddle bunny and not all bunnies want to be cuddled and they have very strong back legs and come late from your arms or a cage but they have fragile down\nSo great pet in the right hands in the household\nAnd it's amazing how strong are back legs or when they could really get\nOh they really really can kind of a karate karate kid for sure but when they leave from you know anything uh you know high at all and I don't mean high like I said I mean you know two or three feet off the ground even they can break bum\nYou know on page eight in your book for the Basij rabbits and pocket patch there's a picture of a rabbit on that page which is absolutely\nAdorable and I loved waited standing there isn't it yeah\nIt's so great I I'm very lucky I had people in shelters in Iowa and different parts of the country\nThat you know take pictures of these adoptable animals and um they allow me to share them so that other people can learn what they look like and learn their basic behaviors and that's really what it's all about it's knowing that you know you don't open up a can of something for rabbits at that rabbits needs\nFiber and lots of water they need to be eating that hey all day long if you ever have a rabbit that goes twenty four hours without eating or twelve hours without forgive me hoping\nUm you've got a rabbit that is in serious trouble\nHe had something on that called GIs basis which is a little different but it would be similar to load and the dog or a college in a horse and it can be life threatening so it's just so important role where of the signs you know what I think most important is Jon is that we know what normal for our pets\nI mean we can more quickly determined when something is a fight right and get him to help they need [laughter]\nOr my buddy just got our soil is [laughter]\nI Love [laughter] [laughter] well since\nWe're on the topic of the you know that rabbits make two types of them when they re ingest\nYes but maybe they don't tell us which one they're supposed\nIt's actually called the ... and they're um nutrient rich poet\nUh some people refer to them at night because they often don't see them and their their Greece here a little um bunches that almost look like a barrier some sort [noise]\nUm but it's really really important that the rabbits make these in a good form and that they do re ingests them because they need those nutrients that really isn't that could be you know a lot of people call it that it's a nutrient pat ...\nWell before we run out of time here um I Do want to mention that in this book of course and it's called first aid basics for rabbits and pocket pets by the nice work you can find it on Amazon dot com or go to her website pitch safety crusader dot com but you also have ... a year and I'm not a big fan of these natural it's brats\nUm and then um you do have hamsters here as well Ruth\nI Do and it's important and I made a point of it that um certain creatures aren't legal everywhere you can't own a a a ... for instance in Hawaii or California but in other states you can go I did want to include them in the book so that people wouldn't know what to do\nYou know it's so interesting you know like in Hawaii in California that they don't allow certain pets but you kind of wonder how are they going to find out [laughter] but I've had I've heard of stories where they actually find out I don't know how they do it\nMeant you know maybe it's our cell phones or something [laughter] but they find out what's out there and you know if it's a no no they want you to get rid of it so\nIt's really sad but I mean we're over animals and you know whether there are pockets better are large animal I mean they're part of our families and we do a lot for them and they do so much for rush those moments when we need somebody to be there unconditionally and we can always turn to our fetch no matter what type of that it is and we can get that from them even if it's a snake\nI willingly puts me while I Love that you mentioned earlier John about even having the kids read the book because often parents will get a pet to teach children responsibility but what we're finding out is that when children there's actually scientific proof that when children are bonding with a pet\nIt actually makes them more compassionate human beings over time I'm sure there's exceptions to the rule\nBut um you know it's really great that if we bond with an animal we become a better person\nDefinitely I think so too and those people that you want to hang around with to show well Denise I Love you and it's great talking to you congratulations on these books again it's the first aid basics four rabbits and pocket pets and basic birds first aid by Denise ... you can find it

pretty cool that they're coming back on the air I mean it was really tragic what happened to her dad so\nHis son is just a spending and his daughter yeah just like him that his son is can\nHe looks like that and then it's ironic though to how he died that time when you know so\nI don't know all the crazy things he did and he yeah that was a freak accident make\nTime ah well once again you are listening to talk and pet so if you've got a medical question or a bigger question pick up the phone and give us a call so Dr ... an ounce Dr Adriana and um she can answer those questions for you so like Michael what nutrition or whatever you have going on with your pet\nAnd it is Halloween season by the way and um so it was right around the right around the corner and um you gotta be really careful with your pets in one of the things I like to recommend you know a lot of people like to take their pets trick or treating with them I'm\nKind of weird because in this day and age you got to be really careful out there even mom and dad who's like going trick or treating with their kids because\nYou never know what's gonna happen and some people may feel safer having her dog with them but on the other hand you got to be careful because it me freak out your dog to when you all these scary things coming around them and they don't know what's going on so it is I Would take care of your ... and leave the dog at home\nYeah not not have brought the now I don't the recommendation animals on it can react different than be faked out of the things that I'm a ... expected leaking coming functionally bites can happen animal is out of the answer might so I'm just prevent any kind of accident from gingerly Halloween\nYeah no it's it's it's the season to have fun and you know yeah you don't see as many kids I don't any way in my house I get trick or treaters but not a lot but you don't see them as much as I think parents maybe have them have parties for them or by them all this candy and say trick or treat so fun and I hate to say it like when I was a kid do fun of it was\nYou know we went trick or treating four days before Halloween and it was amazing how many people not a lot like four days before they would be I wait until Halloween you know we'd be three days before and then we would go to the day before and we have a lot of people like give us candy to day before but of course we made out like bandits on Halloween Night\nBut back then people were used to it but then again in our day and age where at least mine um there is a scary things were really was razor blades and stuff like that so and they they really did exist I don't think you see that now but I think there is less Halloween or is out there on the streets and\nMainly because I think that the reason that's a scary world about therapy yeah and there's a lot of scary people out there so\nNot even just on Halloween I got to give you a comment you were just talking to Michael about nutrition so\nWe just actually sent me in a note here and it says Michael said he said he he said the show's sounded professional and something good coming out of Tampa Bay besides strip\nClubs [laughter] great well if anybody knows Tampa Bay they do have a lot larger than [laughter] well what'd\nIf you've got a medical question or behavior question were open to that it's nice down here reproduce art program right now from Tampa Bay Florida and we have the uh the doors open up to the pool and it's very nice or were in the studio actually looking out at the water and and the sun's going down\nAnd I'm very nice my cats are out playing I let them out around the pool because its cage and they're out chasing lizards\nWhat are you doing right now okay it's cold and you're freezing sorry [laughter] me [laughter]\nBut you know it's sad um you know when the hurricanes and stuff like that you know hit because a lot of animals do lose their life and you know these factory in effect the farm animals um that are over bread and kept any small cages I've got one that the that one scene I'm so many animals died and I mean I always look at it this way\nIf you put yourself in that animals place is that saying is that you mean I mean how would you like to as a human being\nBeing a tiny little cage with like twelve other chickens that you can't move you can't do nothing I mean in your crammed in there or I reveal um you know a small baby calf taken away from its you know mom and kept in a crate a crate in the dark for six months\nAnd then butchered it'd be on a plate granted I Need as well so I'm not throwing the finger at anybody but I'm saying there are ways that we can make\nYou know the food that we eat the animals that we eat at least give him a life more enjoyable and the time that they have 'em 'cause it's very cruel the way we treat them before their\nTheir heads are cut off or whatever and\nIt's hard to say but it's true and I'm not bashing farms or anything I Love farms and I like I said I I've got chickens myself I've got four of them loving that\nThere might thousand I could never imagine eating them but I Do eat chicken just not my girls [laughter] um but you know it's still hard to see the way animals are treated yeah so you know if we can treat them better and have you know\nOpen eating areas for them and so on and so forth and you gotta wonder too I mean like it's set in the story about all the antibiotics and everything that went into the water system I mean there's so many antibiotics in medicine says things that are put into animals to\nMeet them grow bigger um you know it's it's amazing and we're eating that\n... and um you know that there is a ... and and then hope that it becomes more about the kids that grass fed humanely raised um\nAnd when you go to the grocery store are you going to find those products in in the aisles you just kind of fame I made more\nBy those products um well you know they come from animals that had been raised are humanely I personally am not at ...\n... but I feel like if I ... I mean I Would recommend to look for those products\nAnd also to like any of the stories that we may read on the show um you know in terms of like the one that I just was reading like the legislation introduced into Congress climate change\nUm worst talked about shop with your heart food label guides form listen brand list as you go on to our website talking pets dot com and you read where the news stories are these are all highlight it to the point that you can click on 'em and it'll give you that information that added information it'll take you to other sites so check it out I mean it's really important\nI mean we need to start carrying in this country um it's really sad because I think we've given up for most people have there's still a lot of good people out there but times have changed and especially over the last couple of years\nIt's really become pretty ugly out there in America and the way people are thinking and you see what happened you know today with the synagogue up there in Pittsburgh and it's my home state Pennsylvania and um you know loving people lost their lives and the one guy said it's the most brutal thing you saw him he was on a plane crash um so\nYeah it's it's scary world there's no need for it out there really isn't um we all need to get along and I'm Sorry it hurts me like a dozen other people too and\nYou know I Believe you judge people by who they are what they are not by their color or the way they speak or anything like that that doesn't matter it matters what they do in their lives if they're cruel people and they do evil towards others then\nYou know they get what they got coming\nBut you know we need to be America we need to be the ones that we stick up for everybody no matter what religion race or whatever you come from orientation that doesn't matter um and if people are out there are going to say that it does then you're not the right people starting to me to say it\nAnd our animals don't judge is based on what we look like it for heavy or were they in or\nYou know what does he want to say you're ugly you're you're pretty they don't care I'm you know they don't care what color you are or any Islamic have their food and a good time that's what they give you and then they give you that unconditional love\nI mean\nIt was it's really important so I mean we all need to look at that and make this world a better place we only ... only one we have\nAnd I'm sure you also their report you can tell I live in Florida for Thirty years I just said y'all um but the thing is that you know you've seen it at that we have a according to scientists and I absolutely believe in it we have eleven Thirteen Years left on this planet\nUm because the temperatures are increasing more and more and you don't take as much to you that two degrees or three degrees but it means a lot to the environment so things are going to change there's going to be floods there's going to be earthquakes you know we're going to have

and the benefit of the people see this have happened to the ...\nWhat are some of the the more recent findings that you've noticed I'm looking at the data in a big way that a war maybe either surprising or contradictory to or anything that we currently knew before you started\nHold on the war started that in some of the un high level of one of the things we're learning from the oil dig up that's and the things that are surprising\nYeah I think the one thing that's really striking and I think we knew this was some level but we've really seen it for now is just how different everybody is\nAnd you know being a kind of alluded to that but when we look at both the composition and the activity you know what the microbes are doing\nAcross the board everybody is so so different and that really quaint so the fact that there is you know everybody requires a very different diets\nAnd a very different kind of intervention um to to address how you know that that individuality across the board so that's why level that's what we're seeing that the next thing that we see is that um their functions\nAnd their composition is very different from each other so for example ... is a a short changed that yeah it is very beneficial\nOr for us now that's made by our bacteria and it's the it's beneficial because it feeds the lining of our gut and keep the lining up our gut healthy it actually helps with insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control it help with inflammation it suppresses inflammation\nAnd it actually gets into our body and control it controls human gene

technology radio your source for the latest emerging jak and ... and the Internet trends\nWelcome to this week's episode of ... tech radio I'm Jason masters in her show was brought here by bridge don't they're passionate about making tires you can count on to perform when it matters most\nThis week we're talking cyber security and fitness wearables later in the show we'll be talking to Dr Eric coal he's a cyber security expert but right now we're going to talk to Kurt Vonnegut didn't ski he's the co founder and CEO of motive\nM. O. T. I. V. is a fitness tracker heartbeat censor sleep tracker fitness wearable that is the same size as my wedding band and it has a three day battery life so Kurt how long did it take to develop this I Can't imagine it was easy\nSo yeah I mean it's it's it's taken a while you know most most startups they come out with one product and we came out was fourteen so that was challenged number one you know essentially out of seven seven sizes and a two colors um but yeah I mean you know we started about four years ago it was just an idea in my head and um you know at the time I was I had another company\nAnd I was working a lot I I didn't get a lot of sleep and so essentially I work at the computer and until I was tired and then I kind of roll away from the computer and Lana caught and sleep for a little while\nAnd just everything about my life was pretty uh pretty crazy just a lot a lot of work and not a lot of sleep and so you know the the impetus for the idea was basically to come up with a way\nOf uh of tracking my sleep and my activity that was a little bit more comfortable with it and then when I was used to so you're not allowed to devices that are out there where risk now a device and\nIt's something that really you know specifically to me it's just it was always uncomfortable I wear a long long sleeved shirts or jackets and get caught on it or you know I tried to sleep and it would always kind of keep me out\nOn so you know that was the main reason for it was the should try to make something that was um you know something that was actually wearable you know something that was comfortable you can wear all the time\nAnd so when we started you know starting the process we basically wanted to figure out how big this thing should be\nAnd you know there's a lot of ways you can go about it you could say I want to ring that is you know pretty close to a normal rang a and then put a gigantic battery on top of it or even tried to put a big jewel on top of it um the that the easy path we chose to probably the most complicated and difficult path\nBut um you know I think in the end we come up with a foreign factor that's pretty compelling um but in terms of the number of units that are a number of processes that we went through in ... uh you know hundreds and hundreds a it took a lot of effort to to get all the little aspects of it just right\nYeah I Would imagine um the fact that it's just barely bigger than my actual wedding ring a one it\nMakes me more likely to want to wear it because\nIt doesn't I don't know I've never really been a watch guy so the apple watch I I'm kind of in that camp of people that's just not into the apple watch 'em and it also\nUh with any of the smart watches it it tends to start pushing the upper limit of like you know three four hundred dollars for a a wearable um but but this this form factor it's just so small and\nYeah I mean if if you if you do the research you know as soon as you start getting into recommendation territory you really do need to have that da certifications and a number of other things so\nWhat we try to do is we tried to portray to present the information that we gathered a and then there's a number of ways users can go about finding out what that information means I'm so there's there's plenty of uh information I Believe we have some blog information about what what all that data means and then to use or can take it upon themselves to to go deeper and figure out if they need to\nTo pursue any other actions on their side\nAnd I see that's interesting I I really hadn't considered\nA ... even ... needing\nTo get the okay to tell somebody you should probably see a doctor [laughter]\nYeah I mean it's you know it's it's delicate because I'm sure you know in this respect um you know nothing is infallible on life right there might be something where\nSome weird thing happened in the environment of the person wearing the device and maybe it gives a in a reading that might be a little bit Aaron and if we make a recommendation based off an invalid reading that puts us in a really bad position also put to use or in a bad position so we prefer to give them any

radio I'm Jason master's and I'm Still talking with Kurt ... he's the co founder and C. T. O. of motive M. O. T. I. V. so Kirk you launched products September of last year or how are they selling what the response\nBen and how are you going to move forward with this product I imagine you're going to be collecting a lot of data and making updates to the ap\nSo yeah we actually you know we launch from September things are going really well you know being a start up you know first first generation product we're we're pushing out very quickly we have a lot of really great feedback our our customers are amazing um you know I think\nAs a as a technological company we're we're always looking at the next thing and always moving forward very quickly\nSo the big stuff that we're working on right now internally is a continuing software development and adding more and more functionality to the to the software experience because as I said before you know the hardware\nYou know once you put it out out there in the world that is what it is and what you glean from the information from the hardware is where it really gets exciting you know so for adding additional functionality like we just recently added in health kit\nUh we added in or some other functionality were eventually we're going to have the ability to have some sharing and a ... where you can share your accomplishments with others you know so we're we're going to keep pushing the bounds on that on that front\nAnd you know we'll see where are we going with the with the next product we have a lot of a lot of great things down the road\nRight right now it comes in\nA a\nSlate gray or dark black look and a um\nRose gold or do you have any plans in the future for other colors or silicone a coverings instead of metal or anything like that\nAh you know all those all those options are on the table you know usually what what does that boils down to is what\nWhat feedback we get from customers who are doing a lot of investigations on that um believe me there is no shortage of opinions as far as what we should come up with an extra colors oh yeah\nAnd um believe me there was no shortage of opinions as far as what we should come up with next for colors oh yeah you know everybody has their preference I'm sure there's people that want paying people that one purple so you know for us it's just a matter of making the one that has the the the widest um the Y. disadvantage for our customers but I think you know\n... you kind of alluded to some things like silicon bands and things like that I think you know anywhere ... got a lot of\nUh a lot of challenges or a ring is especially challenging that it is it's on those kind of it's at the tip of the spear as as a lot of people would say in a\nUh I don't know in history but basically you know when you're when you're using your hand you're touching things you're grabbing things you're rubbing rubbing your hand on the counter can device or other things up\nAs you do that throughout the day of rain gets a lot of um a lot of activity versus a risk now a device might not get very much we put a lot of time and effort into making as terrible as possible and bring foreign factor not just made a titanium it's a pretty ... pretty raw material it takes a lot of effort to machine it\nIt's actually a machine from a solid piece of metal is not like a stamped her role um\nAnd not become that became quite a challenge to get it where we wanted it to be a manufacturing perspective we went above and beyond and put a PDD coating on it and so this is a physical labor deposition cutting which gives it a lot more durability than just the basic material that has built built from\n'em so there's you know basically one thing after another we you know kind of nailed it down one after another and added more and more functionality to this to um you know to make it as terrible as possible\nYeah I mean I I didn't even think about like is this waterproof until I was like already in the shower with it and I'm like oh I guess I'd better go look on line and then of course I looked in it is waterproof up to like a hundred and fifty feet so I really there there's nothing about this ring that I was able to look into that\nDisappointed me in any way so I I really have to just hand it to you guys are making a product\nOh great I really appreciate things are glad to hear it and I and I think you know kind of a funny story about the waterproof thing is when we first started making our prototype\nA we have these prototypes that we probably spend about twenty five hundred dollars a piece on a custom machine\nHand assembled but at that point in time um this is like you know probably about two and a half years ago they weren't waterproof at that time so we'd hand them tour engineers we had about a dozen of these and handed them out like hey you can use this protesting do not wash your hands because it will destroy the ring\nAnd lo and behold within two days every single one of those was destroyed because they all forgot that they were wearing it when they walk\n[laughter] yeah but that's a testament to how easy it is to wear because you forget the your way out of it\nYeah and that's exactly the case is like you know even if you know it's expensive uh you know at that point in time and the engineer still manage to do that we knew we had a we had a good proposition at that point so it was pretty exciting\n[laughter] that's a great problem to have at the same time so before we go is there anything else you want to let people know about the product as it exists now or the functionality of the ap or anything you want to talk about moving forward\nNoticed the top little stuff I think we kind of spoke about most of it but um you know one of the exciting other things about this is the you know that even though the battery last three days when you do have to charge it there's a charger that comes with it you'd probably get a chance to play around with that a little bit\nAh so this is a USB charger just lives on your key chain you just pop into your computer and put the ring on and it charges up takes like an hour and a half or so um\nYou know and as as you pointed out a little bit earlier just a waterproof and you know the ability to actually where this thing all the time and actually capture everything that you need and not be distracted and I think you know I think that pretty much summarizes ... are really excited about it you know we've had a lot of great response and love love it when folks like yourself are excited about it as well\nAbsolutely I'm Glad you brought up the charger because that's another thing that um I Know that people in my life like my dad has an apple watch and he's constantly like he'll bring the charger to work and then he'll need it at home and not have it\nAnd it gets to be cumbersome because it's a long court and you got to either keep it in your pocket or in a backpack or something and you you guys were smart enough to\nAh both make the charge report very small\nUh give you two of them one to leave it at home and one to go on a key chain and again it just shows you guys really recovered all your bases\nNow I really appreciate that yeah I mean we you know we have a really really bright team here and I can't say enough about to elect we are to have a have a team that can execute so well and stuff so it's a it's it's been fun right and you know we're excited about going forward and the next thing next great thing\nAll right well we'll look forward to having you on the show again anytime he liked to tell us about new updates coming up or new products coming out if anybody who

masters and we're continuing our conversation with Dr Eric coal founder and CEO of secure anchor consulting you can visit him at online danger dot com let's get back to our conversation\nKids are getting um smartphones pads hand me downs what do you recommend parents do to keep their kids safe are there um are there apps that you recommend that keep them safe or do we um\nDo we keep them in like emergency mode so they can only make calls from them or or what's your what's your method\n... so I take a different approach and most security professionals do security professionals will tell you install software that prevents them limit said and doesn't let them do any of those things here's the problem let's face the reality your kids are smarter than\nBy Eighteen year old son biceps sixteen year old daughter and my twelve year old daughter they are so much smarter than me that I Know anything I Do to try to stop them if they want to do it they'll figure out a way around so to me the better solution is two things one educate your children\nMost kids if they know the dangers and they know the issue is they'll stop my kids used to have a different apps on their phones that they never use and I showed them how those apps and monitor their location turn on their camera and spy on them\nAnd now they will eat all the cash because now they realize what the danger is that it is monitoring spot check on all my kids phones I have my fingerprint so I can log yet if I put my finger on their iPhone and it does allow me because they deleted it\nTheir own disappears for a week instant instant removed because I Need to be able to do spot checks and monitoring second we're central charging stations\nSo I don't let them bring it to the bedroom\nWhen they get ready for bed they put it in the kitchen they plug it in a central location and advising the frequency which they use it some minimizing frequency\nMonitoring the a spot checks and educated again to me it's a much better way than being for that you actually stay prevention software will stop your child because they always figure out a way to test to get around it\nRight um credit card fraud is on the\nRise what do people do uh I mean I I like the website\nUm credit karma as there are other uh\nServices that you recommend or is this a do it yourself a situation do do you like the credit monitoring companies or do you like to just keep an eye on your stuff yourself [noise]\nIt's one of those things you can monitor yourself you don't have to use credit monitoring services you don't have to have other people watching it but the reality is most people are too busy\nMost people are too busy to actually do it themselves so if you're not going to monitor and track closely paying somebody to do it on your behalf is well worth it somebody has to be watching that activity the other one\nIt's well worth it somebody has to be watching that activity the other one I urge folks is do instead have a reputation and what I mean by that is when every ... use your credit card\nYou should get a text message immediately that says there has just been a charge of fifty nine dollars to Europe how the reason why that is so important is most credit card fraud today is\nLow dollar it not twenty or thirty thousand dollars it's ten or Fifteen dollars I actually just have this habit\nI got my credit card bill and it was generally what I expected it to a total value but I check every single line and there were some charges from a store that I never went to in a city that I never went to and they were only ten or Fifteen dollars and the total charges was only Seventy five bucks\nBut if I didn't check my state but very very closely and verify I Would miss that so\nThe problem is many people have credit card fraud occurring and they don't realize it because they don't check their bill or they don't get verification and they miss the small little charges that slip under the radar\nWater

S. L. I. so what he's describing is Brett cancer has been stage one two three four five there's depending on where certain um how much of a lump is seen how much a spread\nIs detected where it spread throughout the body to nearby lymph nodes et cetera\nAnd now there's a um a stage zero and ... re of abnormal cells in the lining of the duck and so your you have a hundred percent survival rate these are people that live along and and um you know do well but in terms of\nIn terms of it being considered cancer I Believe when he was gonna say was\nUm that may actually add more into the numbers now that we are picking up more abnormal cells in the lining of the duck so we'll see if we could get him back and looked like there are some issues on 'em from all the others that he might have been using a cell phone so uh what we'll do is we'll move on to the story and Daniel if he comes back just a a whisper my ear okay so\nLast flu season was the deadliest in decades and experts are trying to figure out why was that now one of the is\nA theory was well it was a nasty strain that was the age three until those strains are notorious for being vicious when it comes to epidemics but another reason which is something I brought up a while back was that was so much hype\nAbout the vaccine not being that effective that a lot of people didn't get the vaccine and so if they didn't get the flu vaccine unfortunately they were then at risk for getting the flu\nWe're told now but only thirty seven point one percent of adults got the flu shots were vaccinated that was the lowest rate since the two thousand eleven season and it was a drop of six point two percent from the season prior so when you have people think I well you know the flu shot is not going to be that's wrong\nAnd it's not going to be that the fact that if they're gonna be like well I'm not going to waste my time well then unfortunately then they get the flu\nAnd somebody would say well that's at all yeah if the flu shot is that effective then who cares whether they get the shot or not we don't understand\nThis year's flu shot let's say clocked in at twenty three percent I'm hearing anywhere from sixty to twenty five percent effective which is the fanciest let's just say but let's say twenty three percent effective that's still crucial that you know as far as I'm concerned enough to save some light\nAnd when you're looking at eighty thousand people eighty thousand that's not good [noise]\nSo we're not that the protests back thank you Dr Patricia I'm looked like there was an issue with the phone how you doing there\nOh I'm fine and you can you hear [laughter]\nI couldn't [noise]\nOh okay [noise] so unfortunately we're having an issue with our with our phone so well ah well I tried to get back on another day so well this is my advice you guys when it comes to the flu I be careful\nWith the hype because the media hype the media is going to be making a real real big deal about what the flu shot how effective the flu shot as you know if you should get it should you you know I'm I'm should do you know phone recommendations of the CDC or are you taking your chance are and and don't\nDon't leave running your health based on don't be running your health based on a flip in I you know media story the job and\nBut then I you know media story the job and I really hate to say that because I'm In the media but the main job for the most part is to save lives\nThey want to but that's not their driving force the driving force it to get you to watch\nThat have to be their primary\nGoal and look I'm a doctor ... I'm a radio doctor on a board certified family position I wake up every day wanting to save lives but if I ran a show\nThat basically said All right well you know you got an edge vitamin E. and United vitamin C. and helping you out of your vegetables and you have to do that I think you know maybe that would save lives but nobody's going to listen\nSo I have the open with some news I have to open with some stories I have to be engaging in because luckily I have a lot of control and creative control I can yell at you guys to do things like you know get your breast jak men check yourselves women check herself\nAnd again we're going to have Dr temperatures you come back on when I'm that we don't have issues with our ah um we don't have his shoes with our computers or our connection and so I you know\nThe average news station half the gate you watch and they have to get advertisers they are no good to know buddy if they don't have people putting money into the network\nThere no good to anybody and so here they are going to cover a story that's going to grab your attention and flu shot because he is going to be out there and you're going to be like oh come on\nWell I don't care and I'm telling you guys right now if they did a flu shot is only eight percent effective let's say this year or eighty percent what you don't really see it makes no difference you still get\nI don't mind makes no difference because you could be the one who protects\nThat's how you have to do that you have to approach things now on the flip side we don't want your thinking or the one of the million that's going to have a side effect\nBut even if let's say a flu shot doesn't protect you a hundred percent from the flu it may boost part of your immunity which will help you not only what that that Kurt strain but others strain that's why I'm such a big believer of the flu shots of the I got it I get\nBecause I Am I Love the I I Love the concepts of you know you know man or God made us a certain way we have an immune system you know we don't have to do too much to our body our bodies kind of know what to do but on the flip side I Believe in medicine I Believe a vaccine and I believe in being proactive\nSo when it comes to when it comes\nTo law you know well you know am I going to inject something in my body in hopes of fighting something that's kind of naturally occurring well one thing we can say is there has been plague there has been flew the Spanish flu for instance there are some real real nasty things real nasty things out there\nThat that unfortunately will take us down as human\nLike a fire fighter is natural you'll still gonna dealt with water right you get infected you still need to fight it started ... vaccine we need to get our act together [noise] twenty seven

there but I think I may have an issue\nWith I won't threats to girlie I won't do that because I don't want to from a stereotypical standpoint\nShow a weaker color and I'll wear dark\nAnd for some

how many people misconstrue somebody being gay is transgender\nBut there's a lot of gay men that love their body parts that don't want to be a woman and they want to be a man they just want to be with men than people with women there's women that either don't want their body parts of they do want their body parts and people with male\nA transgender somebody who doesn't like the body there in\nAnd feels like they\nAre in the wrong body very troubling for them and it's it's difficult and luckily now we have means to allow people to go through transformation but don't assume that anybody who's gay wants to be transgender and so I find it very fascinating that when my friend wants to be out there and dating\nWhen you see people who are suffering levine used as political\n... more toys or whatever\nSo that that we're being told is largely made up of young men and women according to the Washington Post fleeing Central America as violence poverty corruption\nMost are from Honduras but hundreds of also joined from El Salvador Guatemala so it started as a hundred sixty people from San Pedro Sula and then more\n\nBecame involved and coalesced and ... as\nThey travel through Honduras went through El Salvador Guatemala et cetera\nThey say over the years Mexican advocacy groups organized such caravans to draw attention to the plight of asylum seekers and caravans do drawing numbers\nBut when it hit sixteen hundred people by the time it reached the Guatemalan border then there was a lot more media coverage and of course because the election coming up it was big news\n\nNow they say the majority of them are Honduran but if they were sixteen hundred by the time they reach the Guatemalan border where why are we up to seven thousand people right now\nSo the migrants moved through Mexico\nOr now over seven thousand people they get migrants of increasingly banded together to to Mexico\nThe dangerous journey is a little safer in large numbers and and I got to be honest it's the media is covering this and there's cameras everywhere it is going to allow for the for passage\nI mean as if this ends up being a thing like when there were Forrest Gump I and then you know following him and running with him across the country because he just decided to run and run and run around a group beer\nBut you have media coverage it's a lot harder for kidnappings to occur and things like that but I mean it it's a dangerous track\nApparently dark kidnapping there's money shakedowns\nKilleen that can happen they take the course of up their prices charge you more than ten thousand dollars to cross a U.S Mexico border\nSo how was this caravan differently won't want this big one that they they take pride or caravans were organized by advocacy groups southern let it go\nBut this one they're claiming seem to grow on its own and you know what I don't believe that\nBecause it just grew so much\nYou've that because\nIt just grew so much attention the only thing is how are they getting fat\nI mean it's going to take a lot of water it's going to take a lot of food is a lot of them are people fleeing they don't have a lot of resources they can't be spending a lot of money on their two week journey so there might be humanitarian groups helping but seven thousand people a lot to feed that's a lot to shelter\n\nAnd then something and just a little odd about the ... the the the timing\nSo\nYou'll hear you'll see people on Facebook going I don't understand why why don't the Democrats want border security\nHow do we take in seven thousand migrants some of whom could be you know having sinister idea is not all of them we've got kids and families spleen but some you know might be Wilson wolves in sheep's clothing\nDisplacing jobs using healthcare services ... you know ... how are Democrats not wanting a more consistent and organized legal process well a lot of 'em do\nAgain there's a lot of Democrats out there just like there's a lot of Republicans that are really on the same page but that's not what you want to hear in the media you're going to hear the extremes but I think the average person is kind of thinking what we're all thinking\nWe want to help others but we can only help others once we are strong ourselves you could give everybody that comes through your house all your food but then once you start to starve how do you help others\nSo I think a lot of us agree that there has to be a pathway even knows that are immigrants that came here legally many of them go look I had to do what the right way you know we there's a pathway we do have a system for refugees I went through it yesterday very complex\nVery long it'll take about thirty six months to absorb a refugee family but they get aid immediately immediately they get eight\nSeven thousand refugees that's going to be a law now there was a caravan earlier this year that moved to Mexico\nUm\nIt shrank started is twelve hundred but then shrink down to two hundred caravan seems to be going the opposite direction is growing\nThey say the group is about eleven hundred miles from a cow in Texas and the length of the jury can more than double the migrants decide to move towards Tijuana\nTijuana is on the California border San Diego California border\nWith Mexico now from says the migrants were not be allowed to enter now we do have\nA style and we do have a means to help refugees I just don't know what we could do for seven thousand so then in terms of how do we get everybody to agree on what to do with this well\nThe problem isn't the extremes\nYou have one extreme saying whoa whoa whoa whoa wall you know everybody goes back even the kids you have the other extreme going you know what I don't care what it sounds logical if Trump\nIs again said that I'm for it or if Trump is for it I'm against the people out there that no matter what I mean same thing with Obama we did it with Obama's well have a new health care has to be fixed we thought Obamacare wasn't stupid law\nAnd then after that happened I think Obama wanted to do we didn't trust\nWell that's what's happening with what Trump people know the economy has improved\nI think we all agreed that the economy has improved but people who didn't like Trump's mean decided you know what that I'm going to fight 'em all of it that's kind of how extremes worked in politics which are really really think\nNo matter what Trump says if somebody is against him it doesn't matter if they agree with them they will disagree publicly\n\nSo because nobody wants to say Trump is right and nobody wants that Obama was right\nI mean as a whole we have this mess\nI mean there's borders and their security and every other country\nIf I wanted to get into France I I'm going to have the going through a process if\nI Want to get into Italy if I Want you know if you know there are you are allowed\nTo have security protections in place you also should have some means you if you ask somebody trying to flee and then you know somebody isn't just oh you don't want them to leave the kids\nGet the kids safe get the kids fed and you\nCan observe all seven thousand observe the kids the problem with that is then again Americans in trouble for separating kids from the wrong\nSo if we don't want to separate kids from their mom and dad we have to take the whole family so I you know it's a mess this really is a mess now people say well now this was going to help the election and we're going to talk about what has to be done with the election but this is an out the election\nPeople are going to realize that this is an issue and people are always going to try to come and masses and storms are are walls and you know you don't want our goods and services well then you know maybe you want to tighten\nBorder security or other people might say look we innocent people coming we need to figure out how to have a more methodical way of dealing with immigrants or we have the cap and numbers out or something so that if we aren't tests anticipating a few thousand refugees every year\nWe can at least managing [noise]\nI'll tell you what's the latest is when it comes to me that that was going

wrote the book on taxes so that I helped thousands of people saw tax problems they thought couldn't be solved\nThen\nHow often is the author gonna you know be able to see\nNow for me we every time I

go to a room and do the whole set up will make it a nurse visit but also come and look because I'm dying to look at it\nI liked seeing that kind of stuff\nI was like okay let me see my ... I couldn't wait two weeks but the problem is is when they bundled like they were talking about bundling pneumonia bundling surgery if somebody had pneumonia and need to follow up X ray but the actors not paid for how often do you think they're going to get that X ray\n\nSo bundling isn't the best way to do things either because people are always going to cut corners see nobody wants to do anything for free I went to school knowing I'm going to have to do things for free\nThat the whole\nThe whole premise of going into medicine you're going to be putting ... hours you're going to be you know putting in your dues you're going to knock it paid by insurance companies you do things for free but it's the only industry that does that\nCan't get groceries you can't even nonprofit\nHalf do still have employees they still have to bring money and they still have to pay for you know power bills and mail and things like that I mean you know we we still have a medicine is the only only\nIndustry where it is assumed that for free stuff for free time is going to happen and to me that's an issue because there's only so much time you have this is why there's such burn out\nAnd then eventually you could always tell when the doctor starts getting burned out because it's like I'm done doing stuff for free\n\nNow we still do stuff for free but once they start to feel that way yeah once we feel taken advantage of it's hard to get that back\nSo what this next election I don't know if the Democrats do win and they ... they want to spend the whole time trying to impeach Donald Trump and trying to um\nInvestigate them and how one hearing after the other it is going to be exhausting even hearing Democrats go I'm not going to want to see that\nPeople have fatigue whether it's Trump fatigue are

fighting men and women are are heroes came home and got sick because of the exposure to this life has said in Vietnam and other wars\nAnd of course the government claim no connection whatsoever yet now we know the world Health Organization is saying that this ingredient life has said is very likely a carcinogenic agent\nWe're going to be talking about this as it relates to the fact that not only are humans getting it but also it's in pet foods if you love your pets\nStick around we're going to have that plus the standard American high fat diet and we found the answer do it's been discovered we'll get to that according to North south university and body odor could actually help you reduce stress and others I Know that sounds contradictory and a little strange but I'll explain stick around\nOr I Want to turn our attention now to a very important topic\nWhen we go through our training to become physicians we often look at other cultures to find out epidemiological E. Y. certain cultures live longer and others don't why certain cultures get sick with\nYou know degenerative diseases at early ages and other cultures don't and it was pretty readily available and you know apparent to me\nThat when I went through this training and saw the Asian cultures and we looked at longevity we looked at mortality we looked at morbidity causes of death causes of illnesses\nThat the Asian cultures the Asian countries enjoyed not only longer health but they enjoyed better health and tell they died which is even more important than that that's quality of life until you leave the stage of life or not lip\nOut of here after Twenty years of some degenerative disease and I've been in China I've been in Japan and Korea and I've studied this and their diets so I thought today we would\nRecruit an expert on the topic to discuss this with this so that you can take advantage of this as well and you don't have to move to China you don't have to move to Japan you don't have to move to Korea or some other Asian country in order to take advantage of all this knowledge and information we have with us Dr decker whites\nDr Weiss is a cardiologist in graduate of

considered a worldwide expert in disease prevention pharmaceutical non pharmaceutical approaches to cardiovascular disease and inflammation well I could go on and on I mean it's\nAll right well you heard the introduction you too as a doctor had to look at longevity\nMortality morbidity a patterns in other countries and then we see gosh you know you you see the fact that people are living longer and he's Asian countries and it it almost\nCauses one to pause and go I think all moved there because hey I Want to live longer and not only do I want to live longer I don't want to be sick and tell I die which is really where it's at and of course now we know that these Asian cultures there's reasons behind it and I want to have you started\nRight there Dr wise\nHere or there was reason for it and and you really have to prove probable one or the life expectancy quality of life expectancy chronic diseases lower and all these countries have that data\nAnd then we also have the reason why they do which is minerals and vitamins and nutrients from hearing from our food through we have a new study that you know Dr Bob you and I looked at that data over years and years for show relationship but has\nCalcium rain and and all these vital minerals and nutrients vitamins are going down and our soil chronic diseases going up so it's really it's not like the pharmaceutical industry has paid attention they can't\nDo that in a firmer model is a\nProblem and so we have those who are we look to the pharma industry they have a very big chunks\nIn Iraq the calcium the bike hell you know my book quotes around on a system doing dangerous things or how your mouth but on the so the answer the call could have chosen not to cancer and so the call either so that's why we're on the floor and

use auto insurance when you've got something relatively bigger that you have to deal with not something relatively small because they'll burn you when you make that small claim it's worse even with homeowner's insurance\nBut you raise that the doctor bill and if you\nHave a lot of assets you own your home free and clear which like a third of people do you've got things that are of value\nDon't cheap out on liability coverage when you decided to get quotes make sure you have a decent amount of liability coverage because people see those billboards people see those TV ads people see those signs on the side of buses\nThat you have won the lottery you might not ... you don't have to worry about winning the big game or the mega millions you just have to be in an accident you got somebody you can go sue\nWhere a sue happy country\nI was on the west coast of Florida recently and there was this billboard of this person smiling who'd been inherent in an accident and the billboard the person's talking about how some lawyer got um six hundred sixty thousand dollars and they're smiling ear to ear\nPeople out there like that so make sure\nThat if you got stuff\nYou've got enough liability insurance have you got a lotta stuff meaning money\nAnd yelling stuff free and clear you want to look into an umbrella which sits on top of your regular coverage\nAs additional liability very cheap to buy for what you get sold in increments of one million dollars of additional protection for you in the event somebody is able to hold you responsible for something that went wrong\nAnd their lives and they don't have to\nNecessarily show that Europe fault they just have to convince the insurance company is not worth their time to defend you and they just start handing out checks\nJason joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jason\nHey Clark how are you\nAll right thank you Jason you've got money hanging out all over the place\nI I Do and I need some help to know what to do with it\nAll right let me see if I can help these are good problem sad by the way\nYes or what so I've got I've got a I've got\nTwo different for on cake outs I'm from two different companies I work for the past um one is currently sitting about Eighteen thousand and some change and the other way around seven thousand um\nCourse in a longer work for them and the company I currently work for does not offer a for a lot of ... so I guess my question is what do I do with this money that's sitting\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with the the smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nWith the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared that all that money out\nQuickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments okay\nThan we have them let me tell you how many do not call\nThe administrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an IRA they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check 'cause what they do is they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you\nAnd send it to the IRS says withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs vale do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nOkay and then you recommend an IRA or the ... are a ... year here but who do I just you know I hear you talk about you know that it's\nAll right so the story is you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K. and put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill because all that money that was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. with that money not a Roth IRA\nOkay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to her office you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday Now let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is that in a big employers plan or small\nBut it's a very large employer they're tried it on the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA\nOkay so are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nAll your and you could just leave at seven behind him move\nThrough one of the three that you mentioned\nEarlier and you could just leave at seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that the and you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\n... great question so let's say let's keep this simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of them to vanguard and an IRA\nAnd just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause it was with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nTo the twenty five to grow and the vanguard IRA\nAnd then you open a new account with vanguard from Ross in any current or future contributions you may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be the so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these things that are raw is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that send a pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the raw\nAnd this will be a way for you to do it you simplify your wife you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHi Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you got a puzzle you want to see if I can find the pieces for\nYes or a wife and I were looking at twenty Nineteen health plans I'm currently we're we're all on a family planning under my health insurance however the company's starts started charging a surcharge for a spouse that's able to get health insurance through their employer\n'em and using round numbers it's roughly fourteen hundred dollars a year so if I ... my dependents who myself the premiums would be nine hundred\nVersus including her which would be Eighteen hundred on top of that fourteen hundred dollar surcharge annually\nSo she's nine hundred extra month plus an additional fourteen hundred dollar surcharge a year correct so she's ten eight a lemonade twelve twelve thousand something a year for health coverage through your existing employer\n... how much is it for her if she goes on her employer's plan\nThe eleven hundred a year\nEleven hundred a year versus twelve thousand a year\nOr a versus about twelve hundred additional on top of that for the family plan um the nice thing too is if we both take\nOur company sponsored clans that they're both high deductible plans for lines three thousand dollars but the company and San of either the employees are two thousand that's leading roughly a thousand dollar to cover for that you ...\nOh or hers is five thousand but it would cover one hundred per cent lunch that's met so it was the main course will still keep the whole family under one bucket or should we each take our plan and then just tried to max out the annual

the hospital and eligible for the death penalty authorities believe that Cesar say our demand will allegedly said\nMore than a dozen pipe like bomb devices through the mail this week\nMore than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\n[laughter] you know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms which means they got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said\nI Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's\nKinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing it does into research because they know it's a fact of the all new to get everybody\nDemanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a significant number to make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold\nAnd that's where part of the problem is that let's also underline this point Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs in that off\nAnd New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice and said no we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained licensed health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an editor this practice because they've seen is just inflating drug prices and steering people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum and we're not that powerful sorry [laughter]\nChange that momentum so we've got to drill back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also people need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that\nWell there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore the cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers and on all of the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person\nAnd I would also encourage people to write to their elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid of the direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected back into useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son when he he is what all watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nBest thing you said was that [laughter] was\nGosh I Can't get past the revenue explain that to your side anyway the best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money going to the ads and so don't mind them change your mind don't let those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact I don't even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nWith David Lazarus from Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son when he Diaz says family radio\nWell I Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOkay\nStories with is on the car coward show Corey how you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you great thank you [noise]\nCorey you've got somebody that happened in your life that's not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately a those after my wife my wife's dad passed away\nWhile I'm very sorry about her loss\nOf thank you\nSo how can I be of service in this situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while\nTo kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage so we're going to be adding a six sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh oh I\nJust add your wallet just take that and I even stab your wallet a lot you know 'cause that's what happens when you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes you know we're lucky enough though that we didn't have to buy the car true so or saving money there\nAny of the cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a collision comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that to my wife but that was the one of the first thought so had along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah I'm a bales man and raising the doctor most okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to okay with that helps and you\nWere a hundred miles so\nYou know raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a pie or claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway now because the insurer will just eat you up on premium so you want to avoid that and then how old are your vehicles\nAll our oldest vehicle is it's ... for\nYou only want to have liability on that one\nYeah but that's okay but I was thinking to the other two are newer we have a two thousand Fifteen in the car we just got his uh two thousand ... ... so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the four if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we are going to have the board but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most timing for sure\nSo sure it is you in this case there may be an advantage and talking with an independent agent okay you know something people really don't do any more but there are ... agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies and they'd been\nYou know your chance and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they've been there done that for a long time most of them are older it was a lot of young people I have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance thing and you know they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations I done with new drivers were teenagers what's gonna be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nI'm depending on the state and how rates tend to be set in the state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that for your call oh they are and be on a separate policy and then and other places it might be better for him to only be named an additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to how\nHow bad summer or the independent agent becomes so valuable because they know\nHow best to cope with it and they can call from many different companies\nAre some wonder known as direct writer companies are ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent nature and so the agent will not be able to quote those but they'll have enough\nDifferent companies that can quote to you and they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect yeah we've got some phone number is already some friends down there but it seems like it'd be very helpful to have some specific style\nAnd you got to make sure they're not what's called the captive a ... for example State Farm and all stay a chance to write for them are wondering how his captors that you don't want to write for those companies and independent nature is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nRight so they get to the nature of okay you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\nPay

more than one hundred twenty countries I'm Jeff ... this is Bloomberg [noise]\nVisitors Bloomberg Businessweek Bloomberg Radio Hi I'm Jason Kelly channel math and welcome to the weekend edition of Bloomberg Businessweek over the next couple of hours working to bring you use it every week in science magazine an awful\nLot to cover as we always have Carol Tom Barrett key is a figure well known to folks on Wall street came to prominence as one of the big early backers and the financial world a President Trump things haven't gone so well either with that relationship or with berets business\nThinking of President Trump this week once again critical of the Federal Reserve and Jay Powell\nWill come out but we've got a fascinating new book that's out there and Christine Harper it's a memoir of Paul Volcker true civic leader and you can hear how he dealt with presidential pressure during the Reagan Administration plus on a lighter note first class everybody loves it and it is making a comeback\nPlus you've got a much more serious story it's the unsolved murder an unusual billionaire and his wife there's so many theories about what happened it's just they have a story that first\n[noise]\n\nFinally here Carol mid term elections are less than ten days away just over a week in fact so much anticipation as to whether there's going to be a blue wave how big it is going to be whether it's all going to trickle out\nWhen we want to know what's happening on the campaign trail this is I go to die he's a national correspondent for Business Week author at the devil's bargain we kinda like Josh green from DC\nThink the key issue that everybody is watching for is will the Democratic wave\nImmersion if it does all the big enough to deliver Democrats the house or you know earlier on in the late summer it looks like there's going to be a big wave that would put the Senate and apply\nThe strategy is I've been talking to over the last week or so in both parties think the Senate is no longer in the play that Republicans might even pick up a theater to\nSee the real ball game is the house of representatives if Democrats can eke out\nA twenty three St gain they will take control they all have subpoena power it will change the entire nature\nOf Washington in the Trump president said today however uh you know as as tends to happen when when elections get closer ah partisans are returning to their corners have Republicans are consolidating around Republican candidates Democrats are consolidating around and democratic candidates\nSo it looked at one point and if it can be a hair and blue wave in the house now looks tighter I think most strategists favor are believed the Democrats will win back the majority of the navy only narrowly and maybe not at all so you know they're all sorts of scenarios Phil and play as we count down to the days until ...\nThey're having this conference with these helicopters operators and not mentioning any of that at all\nSo I Love it because the point as Facebook hasn't learned anything that you think about the testimony before Congress and how much that they've been kind of under the spotlight you know to be policing the different posts that are on Facebook and it feels like wait a minute wait has has that not meant anything\nWell the the weird thing about is like this is this sort of\nDeep engineering stuff that they are doing this is the the very technical network strategies to spread five gene networks maybe they could use some sort of satellite systems or um you know\nLand base network strengthening tools that they can help these telecom operators use to spread can activity around the world um but that hand is not talking to the part of the company that is dealing with the\nConsequences and it just seems to me strange that the company wouldn't sort of be holistically looking at these issues these issues are not the problem\nNecessarily of the policy team or the operation scene where the people that have to clean it up there the problems inherent in building the system without thinking about those problems at the outset\nSo why doesn't Facebook think about these problems at the outset well why don't they what do they tell you\nWell they see it as sort of a different side of things like this isn't part of that I mean we have we had been hiring security people will be been hiring people who understand how to who to how to implement our community standards we've been ramping up our investments\nBut they're not thinking about it proactively and not sort of what I'm trying to point out in this piece is is if we are going to get to a place where Facebook has learned from its lessons has has really taken responsibility for the problems is the last few years that they as they've gone out and told Congress they have\nThen what that should look like in an ideal world is something with in the process of building out these products right it it's not just about growing but about thinking about ways to build in those protections as you\nGrow right so meanwhile Facebook is trying to put a better face on how it is reacting specifically to elections and the idea of meddling\nThis concept of a war room has come to the fore as we've seen elections in Brazil were also you know days away from a massive mid term election here in the United states what are you hearing from them in that regard and served their plants there\nSome sort of be the end of the road right when when faced because proliferated so much within a country that it's really affecting how people\nThink and react to news and understand what's true in in Brazil in particular with the elections earlier this month and now ahead of the runoff elections on October twenty eighth we're seeing just an a massive amount of misinformation so what Facebook has tried to do is they brought\nUs if they brought a bunch of journalists into their war room they call it where they just have a bunch of monitors that are tracking what stories are going viral and how the ad spending is looking and all of these factors that they need to um keep in mind that they think about where the where the odd activity you might be where where the\nThe very damaging activity might be that they might need to take down or take action on or\nEscalate and everyone from all these different teams that engineers the operator the policy people are all in this room working together\nThe question is you know whether that's really going to be enough um when we talk about the the the way that face because grown um one thing I mentioned earlier in our conversation is that they have come to these places without really thinking about the consequences and one of those consequences that\nThey often don't speak the language of the countries that they're working in and they are in many languages but not all of them on\nAnd so they're looking through and trying to figure out where these problems coming from how can we fix them\nIn some cases they don't speak the language and in other cases in Brazil\nA lot of activity is happening on WhatsApp which is an encrypted application that Facebook owns where you can see what people are telling each other so even if you know what that people are spreading propaganda and fake news and things that are actually leading to violence in the country right you can't take it down or\nTrack it or anything will still feels like Facebook is not you know it kinda waits until there's a crisis right or other people say hey wait this is what's going on for they deal with something that feels like it hasn't changed\nAs it well I think that they're trying to get better about managing the crises\nThey're trying to improve their artificial intelligence they're trying to hire experts around the world and really get educated in the ways in which their platform is being missed use but at the same time\nWe've seen other countries even domestic actors learn from Russia's example and the twenty sixteen elections and we've seen similar activity come out of Iran we sing similar activity come from domestic actors\nSo it's it's really an interesting dynamic right now where Facebook is try and figure out what happened there and fix it\nBut then everyone who who applied those tactics taking advantage of that\nBut then everyone who who applied those tactics taking advantage of the basic algorithm or they're going to keep finding ways to do it\nAnd all all the while this is going on\nYou have this steady sort of drip of senior executives saying pace I'm going to go do something else which came this week might\nBend and read the c._e._o. or the former CEO I should say of Oculus um he's\nHe is left in in his departure a significant in the in the contacts that
