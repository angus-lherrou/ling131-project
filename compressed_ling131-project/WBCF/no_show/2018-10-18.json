diplomacy the dance between the president of South Korea Moon Jae in\nAnd the undistinguished dictator of the failed state of North Korea moon ah and the question here I Greg ... asks in his op ed and I'll ask him to help us understand it can you imagine Greg what it looks like for\nPresident moon to move from a man who is obese in an ... to a an undistinguished dictator who is learning over human\nHumans Savage tree can you imagine that same moon dealing with the facts in North Korea in the imaginary future of reuniting the peninsula good evening to\nEvening to you John and gold and uh that would be a very serious trust of the imagination\nPresident Moon Jae in of South Korea as had three ... on my meetings with Kim Jong un the sheer\nHuman rights was not raised once ... once I'm moreover we all remember that um while a president one gene was chief of staff\nTo the late ... than normal here on a he was the one who can salted with the north Koreans and advised that South Korea should abstain on a\nU.N General assembly resolution on North Korean human rights condemning North Korea's human rights record so\nPresumably this is Don in order to appease the north Korea and on the street in order to press ahead with this so called national re constantly Asian process but the question that I ... I Would like to laugh scares 'em at at what point\nAppeasement at what point does neglecting North Korea is arms against humanity turn into in door Smith of the egregious human rights violations\nTurn into in door Smith of the egregious human rights violations being perpetrated\nIn North Korea pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the steak\nSo Gregg we could put that question perhaps in a different way you know people point out as you've just mentioned that to Moon Jae in a was a human rights lawyer and that's how he came to prominence um many people say well you know as a course ironic now that is not raising the issue of human rights so\nMaybe the question is was he never a human rights lawyer all along that he was just using that to um basically gain power in the south\nTo pose a people who he um didn't like the military leaders and actually that he was very much in favor of North Korea and the first place that he was like his senior advisors now I'm very much sympathizers for North Korea\nWe don't know the answer the question we don't know what's the moon's head but the point is he may not be naive he may be complicit all along in North Korea is human rights violations\nA he has certainly I'm invested tremendously in this process of engaging the north Koreans the south Korean economy's not doing too well\nThe unemployment rate among young uh college graduates is high and still on the ice remember that the important part\nOf president Moon Jae in support base so he's basically laying 'em most of his bed so all of his bets on this inter Korean rapper Sean process well we'll see a human rights lawyer yes and he was famous for having defended\nSome um democracy activists were basically working against the military dictatorship up until the late Nineteen eighties uh of course she was a a lawyer on several Robin ... says that involved a mock says San Matias material course\nAt the time um that type of materials bad\nSo uh actually being a human rights lawyer in South Korea does not necessarily imply that ah that that one would be equally active on North Korea Kim writes but then again\nBeing a human rights lawyer by formation a president Moon Jae in does understand the gravity of crimes against humanity and us on the go ahead\nPlease you in on that point let's talk about a man does letter I'm Amanda ... as a human rights lawyer she wrote a letter in the ... the south Korean newspaper um tell our audience what amended asked of Moon Jae ... oh go ahead Gregory\nMind more widow is not yet Coley ... our human rights attorney or a chart gate human rights attorney currently based in Seoul or there was a terrific letters you published in the ... the very basic question that she asks\nFrom a human rights lawyer to another human rights lawyer she tells him look I have witnessed um I have a atrocities myself elsewhere in the world we both on the stand\nUp basically when are you going to take these violations seriously Mr President when at what point are we going to see your administration getting serious about the the the the human rights violations being perpetrated in the north\nIt's a good question so let me come back to moon does he have a plan to your knowledge\nTo transition from this uh generosity that he's demonstrating towards a man who has no capability as a as a as a transparent leader of people\nThat is a ... to ... ... is there any significant body of literature that says that moon is going to move to another phase when ... when North Korea's engaged\nA well of course this is the argument that engage readers will make bad\nEngagement will bring about exposure to the outside world and implicitly\nI'm a chest we improve the human rights record of North Korea but on the other hand if South Korea focuses on infrastructure projects tourism projects\nEnergy projects pipelines do not talk to people\nOur lives to not talk to people tourism projects can be tightly contained with few if any social side effects so he saw as long as I saw it projects that will help the people of North Korea so far I have not seen any sign\nThat the moon Jae in administration actually has a North Korea human rights policy I haven't seen any encouraging well eight eight when encouraging statement and I would be very very very cautiously optimistic that statement by that\nSouth Korea and permanent representative to the United nations who said something along the lines that South Korea is an active participant in the drafting of the U.N General assembly\nA resolution on North Korea and human rights now in ...\nWill have to leave it there Gregory Scott ... of the committee for human rights Gordon in North Korea Gordon Chang on John ... [noise]\n[noise]\nHe won hard evidence signed me sound like Sarah Fox news the pressure is mounting on Saudi Arabia for answers as to what happened to a journalist ... turkey claimed to have recordings\nOf his murder reports today that he was butchered alive during that gruesome execution inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul audiotapes allegedly revealing 'cause she'll get was\nThe head it and then dismembered one tape has the Saudi official declaring quote do this outside you're going to get me in trouble another voice responds quote shut up if you want to live when you returned to Saudi Arabia well the\nPresident said today he has asked for any tapes that do exist\nToxins that had to make a show he conceded to the Washington Post with a critic of the Saudi monarchy Texas senator cat Ted Cruz in the ... down in the central part of the state offering assistance to local official\nIs deeply in China deeply engaged in China then Saturn China was there it's it's a miracle happened ... with the explosion of commercial and retail electronics for consumers and therefore\nIt is not credible at this point at this point they're cagey about this at this point to replace John however there is migration underway to Vietnam\nAnd Indonesia those are the two countries the economists mentioned and that going forward as the supply chain altered you know devices you're getting smaller we're getting rid of chords are getting more mobile devices and less of the desktop so they\nAre the tablets and other electronics bigger ... the big box servers become little bitty ... servers it is possible that China can be augmented with other countries but not yet\nBut you know John that's not an unreasonable view but the point I think the economists tends to gloss over\nIs that you know first of all there are the terrorists that Trump is putting on and it's making life miserable for manufacturing and China\nBut you know the more important story is that the jumping the Chinese ruler is making life miserable for foreign companies in China and I think what he's doing for various geopolitical in city has is making China an unreliable member of the global supply chain so companies\nFor that reason alone are gonna lessen their um exposure to China's geopolitical risks\nAnd therefore as they can move their supply chain um vulnerabilities\nAnd get out of China Allen you are Mr supply chain what say you\n... I hate to say it but Gordon's got it right I Would\nGo oh my lord oh my lord let me off my chair for a moment ... ... if you're a leadership Fallon that got us to this\nThank you so much um let me just make two quick points first of all what what free trade extremists uh publications like the economist ignore constantly is the fact that national governments much smaller and less powerful then with the\nUS government jerk around\nMultinational supply chains all the time in countries like Malaysia and Singapore\nAnd Thailand are constantly imposing conditions on inbound foreign investment that for all of this talk the multinationals rule the world the company's always wind wind up complying with so if Malaysia can do this certainly the United states can\nAnd secondly there's a great deal of that reshoring ... or I should say of ...\nOf shifting production outside China that's either already taking place or that's being contemplated because these companies know that we're only at the very beginning of Trump's China trade policies and they want to be prepared and PS\nThey are not panicking and all they have have repeatedly said that you know we'd have cause rather not do this won't be the easiest thing in the world but we think that within several years we can shift a lot of electronics in information\nTechnology hardware production outside China to other low wage countries I oh by the way that that includes Mexico 'cause that would really help this country is southern neighbor which which desperately needs it\nAnd what and would by extension help the United states tremendously and I think that that that is far from implausible\nForum cordon apple and apple most apple\nCan move but it's going to be extremely painful because apple hasn't stuff manufactured by Foxconn Foxconn\nOf course is deeply embedded in China but we got to remember John and Allen that socks on once was in Taiwan\nI moved to China yes the economist reminds all of it that many of the factories were talking about in China are owned by the Taiwanese or Taiwanese investors have created them in a dish and that means that whatever we regard as the difficulties of portability has happened already yeah\nAnd it's gonna it's gonna they can move again and also the other thing when you talk about automation and robots that makes it a lot easier to move because that limit doesn't eliminate but it's certainly reduces substantially\nChina's labor costs advantage because a robot in the U.S as we've discussed on this show before is just about the same cost is a robot in China\nAnd in fact the economist did make a good point and that is that\nThat as electronics products become more sophisticated of for the reasons that that Gordon mentioned because of their production is so highly automated there's no more China cost advantage and Foxconn in fact this in the process\nOf making a very considerable investment in advance electronics reduction in Wisconsin so we could very well have the\nResult that China still winds up making the vast majority of the world's walk them in perhaps but the more advanced office increasingly made\nHello I live out that's a that's a severe use of walkman I was thinking about you know the everything you need to know about pac man is in China okay now go one more detail ... one more detail of concern here that I've had for some time there's a new phone from Wall way and I've seen it advertised in the United states what the heck is going on and\nWhy are we allowing that to happen in the United states\nWell thanks in large part to the massive transfer\nOf advanced technology by us telecommunications companies to China Huawei has become a global leader in the latest generation of that telecommunications technology which was called five gee um and and certainly wall way wants to be a big player in this us\nWhen you when you we don't allow packs of cigarettes for ... cents on the street in Manhattan I Would say well why don't we allowing a wall way phone in our borders for that his poison\nWell you're absolutely right and it's weird also because the U.S government and the intelligence community has already label called way as a threat to us don't\nGarden news to people I mean I saw the phone being advertised the latest from Wall way it's that there is no privacy was Huawei it can\nLast long ... yeah I don't think it'll last look I mean not only does one way but also the\n... the Chinese tall and why it's the People's Liberation army yes the states\nThe the Chinese tall and why it's the People's Liberation army the state within a state that are this is state security spy\nSure I mean they they do make these handsets they are sold in the U.S they have been but I don't think we're very much

you watch in Vietnam for the secretary of defense and the U.S navy good evening\nGentlemen thanks for having me on is always a well I guess in in general terms I guess two things are at stake in Vietnam first of all there is just the need for a for partners in Southeast Asia or if you're going to do things to uphold the freedom of the seat in the Southeast Asia and we need we need help\nWhich goes directly to the second broad point which would be just location I mean those were were here for real estate people all the time but it's all about location well Vietnam has location of the United states\nIn effect has no strategic position in Southeast Asia unless it has a allies who are willing to to provide us access to their bases so that we can do things like roads freedom of navigation

spectator\nBrandon I go immediately to long march five booster the Chinese have not successfully tested it since there was an unhappy event or in a previous launch sequence they've now scheduled it a little delight to January twenty Nineteen they need the booster for their\nSpace station plans and for their plans for a lender on the far side of the moon what is your best information about the long march five have they solve their problems or do we hold our breath and see if it works good evening to you Brandon\nWell good evening John and thank you again for having me on and hello Gordon and to answer your question I'm back home in Florida we have a saying even apply pick a fight that slot bowl once in a while um the Chinese yes it's true they're having some technical difficulties\nBut to be fair we here in the United states in the sixties and seventies had our share of technical difficulties with our space program if you give them enough time though they will adapt and the Chinese are heavily invested\nAnd they're heavily committed to achieving a what we know in the national security policy arena as space dominance\nAnd are they are they are offering that so whether or not the next launch\nAnd the next few months we'll work ah I think it probably will but even if it doesn't they're going to keep trying until they get one right and we hear in the United states unfortunately are not competing the way we should be the way we did against the Soviets in space and so they basically in China have a lot of time to perfect\nA the technology they're trying to ah create and you\nWant to translate quickly there's a moon race on and there's only one contestant is that is\nThat's that is one hundred percent correct yes Gordon\nBrand and I'd like to just choose the topic a little bit because I heard you speak yesterday and I was absolutely flabbergasted it's something that you said\nWhich I think is critically important which I think every American needs to hear and that is um we all know that a Google has declined to participate in a Pentagon contract to develop the cloud some ten billion dollars\nA lot of people in Google or upset that um this does not fit in with the Google philosophy of don't be evil but I heard you say and and I just was completely astounded\nThat Google is about to participate in a technology contract in China were effectively the partner on the other side is the People's Liberation army if you could just run through back because there are a lot more details on that but I think everyone needs to hear this\nYeah so basically a quantum computing is it's the next revolution I'm that's that is the thing it is an accent that's real revolution whoever can figure out quantum computing first it's basically like having the cotton gin you know of the laugh at Dodger revolution it it will complete\nLike having the cotton gin you know I laugh at Dodger revolution it it will completely change the way the world works\nUh the Chinese presently have what's known as quantum Internet basically it plays upon string theory and basically without getting into the mechanics of it\nIt's a physics has shown that two up a particle could exist in the same place to different places at the same time and the Chinese have figured out a way to manipulate that particle to transfer encrypted data between the two particles I Am it's work they've been asking is twenty six pain\nFrom that technology that initial investment they\nSpun off technologies like quantum radar which can be a it's believe can see through the F thirty five that multi trillion dollar a program of ours to build the great stealth fighter they can see through it and they're married that to the S. four hundred Russian built defense system\nAs well they are now investing heavily in an actual quantum computing center and on and we and they have reached out to Google about a year ago and Google has expressed interest in not only sending over talent\nTo this a massive new center there building which would be probably operational around twenty twenty twenty Twenty one\nBut Google also wants to infuse cash this is under the umbrella of a state owned enterprises in China which happens to be basically reporting to the People's Liberation army the Chinese have actually not been very secretive about the fact that the quantum computing center that they're building that Google could potentially be helping with\nA is actually not only for civilian purposes but also for military at the same way that Google and apple investment into a I research artificial intelligence research in China is also going to be used for Chinese military purposes\nLet me set the formula here if I understand this correctly Google as evidenced interest and participate in the ... ... and Vance\nAdvanced work on a lie and quantum Kim ... corner and quantum computing at the same time Google's employees have raised a Raul when Google was looking to compete with Amazon and now with Microsoft\nFor the super secret cloud contract ten billion dollars a year at the Pentagon\nI lay out this task very clearly Gordon\nThis looks like Google is siding with the non transparent dictatorship and disdain the transparent military that protects Google's copyright\nYeah I mean that's the only interpretation that I can think of John I'm this is something that I think that the first of all the president needs to think about and we need to start thinking about whether I'm\nYou know in a company which is headquarters in the United states which does business in in our country is permitted to help the Chinese develop their military which is bigger in to kill Americans\nAnd brand and have you seen Google addressed this parrot talks in any fashion\nWell no and if anything there's you know they're they're they're continuing to do business in China\nI Will say though are in both cases of the the AI quantum computing or that they have not actually going forward with it this is all you know starting the groundwork right now but I went less awareness has risen I think\nAh I think that things will go on without the American people knowing until it's too late and so what part of my\nMy hope is to raise awareness among the American people to say hey maybe we shouldn't have some of our best companies going overseas investing in the centers that could be used to it or leave defeat the United states\nUh enough you know whether it's economic or military competition and there's something very interesting that there is a man by the last game of Slater way of\nTwenty second spread oh go ahead or basically the there was at the English English mint is the reason why we won the industrial revolution against Britain it was a British expatriate and name Slater they called him slate of a traitor and England and so the same thing might be happening with American companies going over to China building up our our rivals\nAre somehow that phrase that they liked early on and Google garden that

here to this country they're going to experience academic freedom and intellectual freedom and therefore they'll go back and change China and the fact is is that they feel probably even more under

which\nThe degree to which they carry these views forward as opposed to feeling some type of pressure to uh to abandon those views or do they stay here you know all of these are the open questions I think what we can say or at least at the at the\nThe largest level of of looking at the data of Chinese students in the United states is that we now have the experience of millions of Chinese students having studied here\nMany of them are probably the majority having gone back to China at least after some period of residents in the United states and as far as we can tell having very little effect\nOn the path of society so it doesn't mean that we should uh turn our back on them or burn them we should be encouraging them uh but for the broader argument that what this is going to do is

and the president said Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was proven innocent confirmation battle hey everybody hates Laney America send night\nHis side is we fall\nThey say so the midterm elections are going to be interesting I think it is going to be interesting to see what happens in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild few weeks there is no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House in the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court\nDeserve better than the terrible pain and suffering and he was forced to endure he said uh for his\nPart Kavanaugh said he would assume the role with gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but ... over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think\nWe're going to see many more protests are going to see some fallout from this or or not one of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins as somebody who\nWas um spot on\nBasically in the wars that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and against that sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact he said because there there were donating that are well up over three million dollars I think now that were put out there saying that if she voted yes on Kavanaugh\n... all those credit cards would be process so there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think of our politics have come to the point where people are trying to five votes and by positions and we're in a very sad played she was on sixty minutes and she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began the campaign last month to pressure her she because they knew she was a key swing vote and then Kavanaugh's nomination process and if she voted no like I said the donations wouldn't\nWould be a would not be taken for the donors the ... the pledges were processed so now\nWhoever the main Democrat is in two years he'll get that money that's being raised and it's interesting because calling\nOn friday heading into the weekend announced he would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault she said and concerns about threats to roe v Wade with predominantly conservative justices on the Supreme Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now you know over this three million dollar mark like I said and it's still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect on a senator Collins politics the mob wow\nRed spot intensifying I look

that map and it's not that's not happening\nThis this looks to be very very serious very very serious and then sadly what they're talking about it some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm it knock it they're not going to get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that with a crushing and the first place and parts of the Carolinas\n'cause that's a possibility and New York\nThey're not talking about hurricanes are talking about the state of limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license dilemma wasn't supposed to be on the road they fail to state inspection at as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including too pedestrian in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown at the outside of Albany New York and his dad the\nIt's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and they they're investigating it but the limos slammed into a park S. U. V.\nSo the people inside just killed four sisters died he just bought the limit blew through stop signs slams into the parked SUV everybody inside was killed and then do two bystanders\nAre died as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know these young families young married that in their twenties early thirties\nUm I Can't imagine what they are going to have and they shut down this company this this company had um\nYou know it's crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating this is the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm a few didn't as an undercover informants for the FBI wow and you know what the governors sang and he's right is they had no business having missed on the roadway it's failed inspections they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all the things you're supposed to have [noise]\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people's lives I mean wow there was a couple that just were married like four months ago ...\nIt's just an unexplainable things and I like I said I Know that area I Know that area well up by um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nSo that's with the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from uh this past weekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen\nIs the former President George Bush and his daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding where it was just the families in I'm In Maine so Barbara Bush walk down the aisle\nWith her father T W and our wedding which to Craig coins who is a screenwriter someone she met\nWhat to Craig coins\nWho is a screenwriter someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend\nAnd released in the pictures you know we're on a social media and what not cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that I'm looking at a happy as can be but um\nNo ... no big

is thirty seven and she cofounded a public health non profit called global health corps\nSo her sister genna Bush of course they are like I said with her daughter's um\nThat that's just to me that was a cool mom and it was a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how does that that whole sort of understand that things were not telling the media were not getting we're gonna try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can have some pictures come out\nAnd they managed to do it which is wow shocking 'cause\nIt's so hard to keep keep anything is secret anymore\nNo he

had a different versions of that night\nA different version of how he he drank ears and go ... or so\nThere were some definite goals and everything I think Korea\nIs a very important he moves on

around with it so there's thirty five counties that have been declares\nAn emergency state of emergency\nDoes that mean the funding Florida State\nTheir clothes their closed from Tuesday through friday this that's how serious they were taking it no way to take a chance to make sure all of the students and any of the faculty is nowhere near there because this is right where it could

they must means that people were injured and a couple of people were killed and now we're saying that stretch limousines killed Eighteen people in the limo to people who were walking and it and that's twenty\nSo ah I mean that's terrible and what happened was that the limo went through a stop signs and boom I you know unfortunately just collided and kill the people that were\nIn the limousine and it was um I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked I mean just the worst up victims texted that the women who is in terrible conditions minutes before the crash\nSo you had various surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board and terrible condition limo and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happen or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limousines\nDidn't have that this is what's so scary didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate they held a state inspection last month how do you know that right you see this limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever you are you asking about that are you looking into that now\nSo they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery so two people were killed you had um\nThe people that were in this limousines you you had um husbands and wives you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was a tech the text message I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo is because there was a last minute replacement after ... hired to shut down a group broke down because that's the first thing that happened I mean what\nAre you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific 'cause you know in their twenties and thirties\nUm yeah really just really really\nOne of the biggest losses of life and and this is

into a park SUV and then the two people\nOf you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there them they were hit so it's a\nIt's it's just awful and it does make you kind of think\nAnd

on time they get you know are they do they know if they they have a federal certificate\n... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people\nIn his limousine [laughter] you know maybe I got to ask a few more questions or find something else out about that\nCompany because those people were thinking that they're just thinking that you gotta be kidding me the first we had this break down then we get in the limousine and this happens and then the worst thing hospitable I mean just absolutely possible happen we've just scratched

what they is what they said and Susan Collins\nSaid that that that she talked to Kavanaugh and the thing that she liked about Kavanaugh she felt that he was about the letter of the law and she felt like he would go by that because she's pro choice and meaning that weighing the law and the precedent and all that\nKinda stuff um and she said there ... there was no evidence there so there was not

All right then All right but the market is less successful this morning we're looking at a town day what's driving that says it's more trade tensions given the fact that the or is it said that China's market falling out of bed what do you attribute that show\nOut there as soon as one of these drip drip drip of not so well received earnings that as soon as they send you out I mean look if you want\nTo see we points you will find them and when people do see weak points they definitely take it out on companies you know you look at what's down in the U.S and the five hundred today you can see that I'm Talking about a company like tech strong we are as a\nBusiness jets and helicopters and their third quarter earnings and revenue trailed analyst average estimates that Bloomberg survey that stocks down more than seven percent\nAnd you've got seal there the maker of packaging material like bubble rats down seven and a half percent after their results they cut forecast for the year after coming up short in the third quarter so if you can point to enough examples like that\nWhen you or whatever the rationale may be behind it yeah it certainly looks like a companies that don't deliver are definitely being shall we say taken to the woodshed\nYeah and the ones who do deliver aren't necessarily seeing the benefit to the degree that perhaps they would when people are feeling a little more optimistic right well perhaps\nYeah I mean let's put it this way uh you got\nFive stocks and you know some people under the phone more than five percent and the biggest gain right now Philip Morris international their third quarter results out a earnings and sells ... Smith and they're up just about five percent so that gives us some idea of what you might consider a disproportionate effect\nYeah it's interesting to me also ... ... talk about some of the ... I mean IBM for example which reported earnings earlier this week yesterday was down a nearly eight percent today is continuing the declines right I mean it's sort of people are forgetting so quickly if people are sort of taken declines and saying we hold my beer I can do better than that\nWell IBM if you want to talk about the company's specifically I mean they have had issues for for some time with sales kind of figuring out\nHow to reinvent themselves they made their big on Watson artificial intelligence as well as cloud computing\nAh that's said to look at the last few quarters and was like the old\nBig mainframe machines that were holding them up and now a demand for those miles is kind of backed off and and you're seeing the affects not only in terms of the earnings but also now isn't it isn't in terms of the share price down to a hundred and thirty two dollars and change\nI gave I Know you you certain you tabulate all the data and you're watching this sort of holistically as well as idiosyncratic Lee with a specific stocks\nCan you give us sort of a report card so far given sort of the a smattering of earnings reports that we have gotten as to how well or badly ah companies have done versus expectations in other words\nOverall all things being equal should the market be responding a little more positively than it is or people just looking for the negatives I and sort of going with that said\nWell just to take a quick look here thanks to my trustee Bloomberg Terminal on where things stand\nI mean you've seen uh the numbers in terms of third quarter profit girls come up by more than a percentage point since companies started reporting so you're now closer to Twenty one percent than twenty percent of the terms of earnings growth\nAnd uh you know not a surprise to see your company's beating announcements three quarters of them actually and that's fairly consistent with what we've seen a in the past few quarters so you know as far as that part of it goes you know companies are delivering a\nThe question then becomes you know what happens if they fall short and then what if their outlook isn't as rosy as their way the numbers would suggest that's where you see the weakness\nThank you though this is really helpful perspective three quarters of the companies that have reported so far have beat estimates that by many accounts were thought to be pretty rosy right I mean when these weren't you know terrible as to ... to begin with and they beat them and some market is sort of looking for the negative\nYeah I mean that's sort of sums it up here and we may well by the time we get you know the bulk of the numbers in be closer to the twenty four percent earnings growth rate for the U.S some people on that we saw in the first the second quarter\nBut then again people do know that some of that's tied into the jak tax law changes within the last year and that effect is going to fade\nAnd at the same time you know you have higher commodity costs higher labor costs higher transportation costs and the effects of terrorists yeah or through a lot for companies to deal with a you know in this quarter and be on\nThe stock markets rallied from earlier this year certainly has a couple of asterisk next to it at least in the eyes of many investors and if I Do want to just get your views are real quickly on what we're seeing in the bond market ... relative to the stock market usually when you see a down market\nI in equities that is a boon for I treasuries and you know guess treasury yields that actually takes a little bit lower after being higher earlier in the day\nBut you're not seeing that slight quality and the same way and a lot of people are saying this is a sea change their mentality they could vote vote more pain ahead because people are resistant to sending those yields too low\nI can look at it from the stock market perspective and said just today a what's up in the U.S in the five hundred among the main industry groups\nMakers of consumer staples food beverage to back in the summer as Philip Morris international yeah mentioned earlier that said you're talking about a three percent dividend yield for the industry index which is comparable to what you're doing a ten year treasury then you have real estate and utilities to other interest rate sensitive areas of the market so\nState and utilities to other interest rate sensitive areas of the market so you know there there can't be that much concerned about where rates are going if you're seeing these groups do well so it's just an interesting sort of contrast going on\nOr else perhaps there isn't perfect logic kind of starting a narrative throughout the markets that's the other\nPotential ... the editor comments and bloggers and life go on at the Bloomberg thank you so much for being with us as always it's always a pleasure to get your insights and just looking at the market right now Dow Jones leading that actually know that the NASDAQ is leading the pack\nA tenth of one percent decline right now its head tour Ninety nine one newsroom and Washington DC Nathan ... world's national headlines state\nPolice or the exodus from Saudi Arabia is Davos in the desert conference continues UK trade minister Liam Fox the latest western officials to pull out of the investment event in light of the disappearance and possible killing of journalists ... at the Saudi conflict in Istanbul\nNo perhaps it was a little bit of a sudden a momentum I mean if you look at the orders data the intentions to order and you look at consumer idea about business conditions there actually up\nSo if anything here we have to get another month as of solid gold ... grade yeah solid growth and indications that both businesses and consumers think that this is going to continue at least for the next few months listen this is a very very important point yes\nYou get an economy this big this dynamic and and this is a complex you get it started to roll down the track it's awfully hard to stop so is there a chance that in two years a coup grind to a halt is not a great chance though\nAll right but growth\nHas slowed somewhat in recent months right and that is sort of\nA question about whether this means that perhaps there is a labor shortage or if you want to call it that are tightening or you know you're seeing some constraints with how hot the economy has been running and if that's the case what's got to get as it higher wages is at a slow down what what's your view on that\n... that's exactly right it's constraints because we not only have 'em as the uh uh home builders association called a generational low unemployment rate um and we're still getting better than a hundred and fifty thousand new jobs per month\nAnd be a less is telling us that there's seven million unfilled positions out there so clearly there's a signal here that you know we need more more people to come to work\nIn order to keep this thing going I'm an either we have to find people and train them because if they could do the job they'd be on the job already and or yes this is at some point going to start to pop in terms of more wage growth that's the key\nBecause what consumers are looking for is more wage growth would businesses worried about is even more wage growth not matched by price increases right so if there's a dangerous signal here that it not that there are signs that things are beginning to you know slow down are beginning to you know ... moved toward an exit we're not close to ...\nSo are there signs that companies are biting the bullet in offering higher wages to get workers ... regardless of whether or not they can pass on the price increases to consumers\nHire more workers spend more money on training them and when they can get more workers who just simply stopped doing some things um and but that's not new but I mean they've been in that mode and now we're better than a year and a half\nI don't know that it's worse now than it was six months ago a year ago what would that it's gonna be worth six months from now but that's certainly as a condition and one of the things that's going to happen to surprise that has not been more is to see more wage growth\nAll right so let's think in some of these uh some of these numbers here the interesting thing to me that stands out frankly aside from\nJust consumer expectations that continues to be incredibly strong and strengthening its manufacturing orders and I'm Wondering you know we're seeing increases in there and how much of this is front loaded to get ahead of tariffs and how much is this a sustainable over a longer period\nYou know the question is how much of this is cut you off because it took so long for them to start to to order took so long to start to get them to start to invest and so and in part this is ketchup or for what they didn't do the last two three four years as opposed to worry about what's coming down the pike\nOkay so that's how long can that be sustainable though\nAnother you know the two years and those are the three years that's not even close it just started to ramp up it's not even close to ... do\nAll right I Want to shift gears a little bit because you mentioned the housing sector and this has been sort of a big asterisk over the recovery they started to see a truce flood out in the housing market how concerned\nOver to not not concerned at all as not to slow down we all we have and again none of this new we've had the problem there is no lack of demand is no lack of people lining up\nFor those new homes to get mortgages to buy those new homes built lack is getting folks out there to build homes because they can't get the permits or or they can't find lived are that it's All right so the problems on the supply side none of the demand so\nI Want to push back there because there was yet another report today coming out of ... I was saying that rents has dropped in the U.S for the first time since two thousand twelve so that suggests a lack of demand or perhaps a peak and pricing do you not see it that way\nNo absolutely not and in fact the problem is all those folks who can't get into a new home they're still renting 'em and so they're having a sign on new\nCan't get into a new home they're still renting\n'em and so they're having a sign on new lease so I don't see that that rents are going to start to slow down I'm outside of you know the the unless you're talking about the east side of Manhattan but\nThis is overall for the U.S is I ... I I just don't see it\nAll right so you think that that's part of an overblown story line\nAnd and the reason why two things one is folks who are locked into an apartment yeah because they can't get into a new home and the second factor again come back to all of these ... new job all of these on fill positions that are going to some of them are going to get filled in all of those folks are going to need a place to stay\nAll right Ken Goldstein thank you so much for being with us as always\nKen Goldstein economy to with the conference board talking about the leading economic indicators which look strong and strengthening the U.S equity markets are not strong and strengthening now than they are off there earlier lows now to act out at seven tenths of one percent Dow Jones down five tens of one percent per se that hundred down\nA similar amount treasure you dig a little bit lower but not as much as you would\nExpect family ...\nAnd also as that goes to ... chasing after soldier measure is getting caught up with the crowd\nManagers at the gym took a long term [noise]\nUncovering opportunities for our video perceived risk\nAs Howard our rise with tungsten global lesson manager\nInvestment management businesses residual financial learn more in the G.

reliable Trump ally called for the removal of Saudi crown prince the hot to solve it tickles weight in a\nBad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended they had nothing but contempt for us what you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the president has done this guy's got to go\nHe's got to go Senator Lindsey Graham the Republican from South Korea some South Carolina pilots underneath the Bloomberg News White House reporter knows all about South Korea North Korea but let's start with that's why Senator Graham saying all this\nAnd he's really just sort of the outspoken front front position a ... and what is it it's been sort of an\nA under the radar behind the scenes anger at Saudi Arabia that's bubbling up in Congress Lindsey Graham is has long been known as a hawk and he's really a speaking out for a number of senators who are in the Republican Party and support President Trump\nAnd haven't yet been willing to be quite as outspoken but we're we're hearing more and more from them now that they're not happy with the direction that Saudi Arabia is going this\nLatest situation with the apparent murder of a journalist who worked for the Washington Post and the Turkish and the Saudi constantly in Turkey it's just the latest outraged a vet has caused Congress to really reassess the relationship with the Saudis\nWe've had the war in Yemen that has led to hundreds of civilian deaths that Saudi Arabia's ... intimately involved in we have all kinds of human rights abuses the treatment of women in Saudi Arabia that has led\nTo a lot of concern within Congress that Saudi Arabia at large and specifically the new crown prince who is making a lot of moved very quickly\nAnd sometimes appearing to uh have a lot of disregard for human rights and that's leading to a ... a a great amount of concern in Congress and Lindsey Graham who someone who's very close to the president\nAnd someone who has felt the freedom to speak out and to basically clashed with the White House on a said at the White House needs to do more of the White House needs to be much more aggressive and calling for the ouster of the crown prince even though the White House especially Jared Kushner has had a very close relationship with the crown prince\nSo what kitten of Congress do to sanction the Saudi Government on its own and how would that look different than what the President Trump might do\nThat Congress has already started to talk about potential sanctions they sent a letter to the White House calling for a one hundred and twenty day review under the global Magnitsky Act which basically gives the White House a hundred and twenty days to do an investigation sea of human rights were abused and whether or not sanctions needs to be put in place that\nGives the White House some authority but Congress has already shown a willingness to break from the White House and passed sanctions with a veto proof majority they did it with Russia last year they passed sanctions against Russia for meddling in the election over the objections of the White House\nAnd because it had a veto proof majority President Trump had to sign that a breach grudgingly and Congress is gearing up for that type of action now if it appears\nAs if as it appears the Saudis are responsible for this uh the disappearance of Mr ... it's very possible that Congress on a bipartisan basis passed sanctions\nHitting 'em everything from Saudi arms sales to ... to to Saudi officials to um travel by right as Saudi officials to the United states to freezing assets they have a lot of tools at their disposal and if they have bipartisan support they can do it over the abduction of the White House\nOn because it's checks and balances the Republican controlled Congress really keeping a Republican president on the issue of the international community in check the Magnitsky Act the global Magnitsky Act the Magnitsky Act was has never been used to Lou\nAgainst any other country but Russia and oh yeah it wasn't that the Trump Tower meeting subject between ... junior as well as the tally of that southern tier in June of twenty six teams\nYeah that's exactly right this is an act that has gotten under the skin of president Newton because it's really restricted his ability to to to do what he wants to do with in terms of his relations with the United states it would be a very strong move against the Saudis and could really up and\nThe alliance we've never used this act specifically against an eye and it could undermine the relationship between\nYou and and I have a quick follow up here because with regards to Saudi Arabia particularly as the U.S Saudi relationship ... seems to be trending in a negative direction what does this mean for Qatar what does this mean for for now who is\nThe direction what does this mean for Qatar what does this mean for for now who is going to be the middle east ally for the shopping the destruction\nYeah we did see the Trump administration's side with the Saudis over the Qataris during the ... they had last year and we're sort of waiting to see whether or not that shift because there was a lot of internal debate within the administration over whether to side with the Saudi blockade against the Qataris last year it was a controversial move but because the Trump Administration is so close\nTo Saudi Arabia they decided to side with the Saudis but now members of Congress are being much more outspoken about their\nUnhappiness with Saudi Arabia and we could see sort of a ... a line that within the middle east and a ... a ... a a new understanding of how the Trump Administration decides to interact with Middle Eastern who should be close allies in who cannot be relied on any more\nCulturally less than half a minute of has the Trump Administration put all the things in Saudi basket\nOr well not ... not completely\nThe but the issue is that this administration has made a lot of enemies from you know turkey and trying to a pressure turkey over the release of pastor Brunson this is an administration has been very a strict with a number of allies and losing Saudi Arabia have I could I was and I could be a big problem\n... White House reporter thanks very much more congressional break down to the dentist later but coming out of the politics policy power and law but now we go to Bob ...\nWith a check on the national news stuff thank you Kevin secretary of state Mike Pompeo says the U.S will hold off on a response to the disappearance of journalists ...\nI'm obviously this is not really looking great from a sort of you know just a ... perspective um but it's whether the prosecution will be able to prove that that actually means the traders colluded and you know on the market to be unfair as as another point\nWell how is the defense besides that going to counter this evidence that seems to be spelling out the prosecution's case\nWhat the defense of trying to say is that the traders all did this as a standard practice they were all talking to multiple people and chat rooms all the time to get information to understand what was going on in the markets that to be able to sort of\nUse that as an edge in their trading and what's interesting also is that the defense has pointed to the fact that sometimes the straighter said one thing and the cats and then did another thing in their training lock 'em so it's more like a game of poker is what they the defense or trying to claim here\nNow the prosecution's star witness was a member of the group that the prosecution flipped he's on the stand now how is he doing\nAnd he actually just left a stand earlier today but what he has been doing has been very measured he's very calm on the other traitors or British and so you know they present to you know Mary calm British way\nAnd he basically laid out his reasoning I'm for being in a chat room for you know trying to gain advantage um helping out other traders and trying to to basically came up with them in order to get the outcome that they want to move the prices in the direction that they wanted to\nOn cross examination what the defense able to establish any parts of its case with this witness\nI think the defense was able to say look these ... you all had this information from each other as well as other participants in the markets did you act independently\nAnd the defense really did hammer home that point even though the traders knew all of that stuff that was going on in the markets when it came to the end of the day\nThey would sit at their desk and punch in their own numbers and trade independently of each other so that's really a a strong point that the defense is trying to make right now that\nThey're all they all may know similar information but they're all acting independently and maybe in parallel but you know it's it's coincidental all in markets are sharing information and you know there isn't any specific anti trust collusion here\nOn cross examination the defense was able to get into evidence that the u._k. serious fraud office had dropped the charges against these three why would the judge allow that you know information from another jurisdiction into this case\nI think it probably the judge allow that because this is going to become a factor in both cases both the arguments from both sides that the defense is trying to say look these are British traders\nUm you know that that the U.S doesn't have to go to prosecute them and actually one of the witnesses for the government today was trying to make the point that a lot of these trade affected us entities\nSo they gave examples of mount the dollar amounts and the number of counter parties that word trading in the U.S that may have been affected by these trade so it's going to be a come become a battleground whether this is relevant to the u._s. or whether these British traders should have a you know state in the u._k.\nIn your story you talk about how they they almost knew at one point that they were being watched but they kept on going\nTony twelve rehabbed alive or scandal that start to become reported in the press and the u._k. and so these traders start to think well is there any commonality with what's happening in ... versus what they're doing in their own chat rooms but clearly hasn't dawned on them you know that that the government\nWhat they're doing in their own chat rooms are clearly hasn't dawned on them I'm you know that that the government might find these two choices very similar so they actually do make a couple of jokes about that\nHow much is the government on on line here as far as it has to prove its case or a you know what repercussions if it's not able to make this case\nWell I think this is a very critical case I'm obviously the foreign exchange industry has gone through a lot of soul searching and huge huge amount of penalties and find out about fourteen billion dollars all told for all the global banks who were wrapped up in this um benchmark scandal and foreign exchange so\nI think one only one person in foreign exchange and individual traitor has been convicted of fraud prior prior to this case so I think it's a very very important a bellwether for whether they're going to become more individual prosecutions as a result of this scandal\nHas had the crackdown and the scandal helped to clean up the industry\nI think the industry has changed a lot a lot of the people I speak to actually feel like they're being watched by big brother all the time\nAnd they're they've really really cleaned up in terms of the language they use a being more careful about sort of nationalist them and\nAnd conduct in general and anything that might signal to their compliance department that they're even to being a little bit naughty and obviously not and this is not the same thing as as committing crimes better there there is definitely an awareness in this market that the the actions Andy the settlements that occurred before\nUm are no longer acceptable and um so they're very very cautious these days\nAll right thanks so much for watching the trial so close to being forty on to us that plan and when she to Bloomberg News\nAt

the c._e._o. over at aries so at least private equity to it as\nA private equity date with this guy right the fifth largest publicly held a PE from but really it's been kind of under the radar in terms of name recognition the face of the farm and also in terms of their strategy but everybody's watching their do everybody's\nWatching because private credit we talked about it all the time we are going to understand more fully what that is and why it's such a big a profitable opportunity\nWe got to talk of markets that everybody because we have seen volatility creeping back into the equity trade for sure\nOver the last week or so we're just cutting off our loews but still down by the one and a half percent on the ... the Dow at NASA sucked out of that to present let's bring in our team they will send stacks editor at Bloomberg News along with ... he's a global macro strategist apple Britain is both of them in our Bloomberg interact and broke her studio so Vince if you're on a trading gas\nTo end a day like this I don't know how would you read it\nUh it's kinda fun I mean volatility is what traders look for say the more evolved good trading additions plenty of opportunities\nTo make and lose money but the opportunities there to get it back if you lose that fun day but it's not a freefall kinda day no I mean we're once again we're doing this again ... the

Mexican peso down one and a half percent after Trump threatened to close the border because of migration so a lot of threats coming out of the administration is down on trade down on migration down on global growth\nAll right Dave he teach you up there don't fail us now have often now I have to become an as well forget about this because you've been watching markets just like France for a long time when we when we go below a technical indicator sometimes that can mean a bounces coming or it can mean the indication of another ... negative laying down\nFor the very least it's something to watch the whole idea of a two hundred day movie average CEO looking back basically\nNine months or so trading and just trying to get a sense of what the markets trend has been so kind of had this going on for the past week or so of the S. and P. five hundred on either side of this moving average\nNow we saw the same thing happened three times really earlier this year and they each case\nStocks managed to bounce back so the question becomes is it going to happen again and and if so how much of a bounce do you get\nSo that's the sort of thing in play here but beyond that I mean it's really a story about how uh companies to this point in terms of earnings are just getting punished you look at the S. and P. five hundred and you see you know the\nFour biggest declines are all tied into earnings in one way or another and\nYou know three of them have an industrial ... theme behind them or we're talking about tax ... the maker of the business jets and helicopters\nYou talking about snap bomb which makes tools and United rental ... heavy equipment rental company in ... case people didn't like what they saw the numbers and the stocks took quite that they're all down at least nine percent United

that\nBand you know it's interesting one of the stories that caught my attention today hum came from taping marketing is talking about the U.S recession at chances in the next\nTwo years topping sixty percent\nSo it's no longer fifty fifty that a little bit more scared I Do feel like fence that we've heard Jason to write that we've heard from a lot more of our gas coming on a Bloomberg Businessweek saying you know maybe it was next couple of years you know I don't know if everybody knew that\nRight we'd all be really really wealthy and living I don't know and some exotic or Ireland won anything do they have\nThat kind of visibility and make these gas in now and that's\nJust spit balling I mean but there are indicators out their housing is declining adorable decline in car sales are declining so the things that generally prop up the U.S economy fading a little bit\nNot only do we have trade tensions with China but things are starting to get a little slippery in Europe Brexit pretty much stalled and now we've got the Italian budget which looks like we're going to get some serious pushback buddy you next friday the U.S and the rates of talent and sovereign debt\nVery likely to get a downgrade has this if this continues to press in this direction\nThat will weigh on European markets again Moody's will step up and likely follow and within a short space before the months over\nAnd so now you're getting pressure from both the Asia Pacific and and Europe and that gives that recession probability and increase\nRight I'm not sure that synchronized ... is that just nuts with it a

fact that it gets the most red story or second must read story of the day Charlie signed is us investing reporter at Bloomberg News on the phone from our Boston beer hey Charlie nice to have you here with\nJason and myself I'm damn we talk so much that that this Hassan manager passively managed money world and yet invest almost six billion dollars to go into active management tell us about this deal and why they're doing it\nWell to bowl ... as you pointed out but we spoke to the invesco CEO and he said you know people are flat out wrong thinking that all the money's going to pass if he's not saying passive is going away in fact invesco has a pretty big\nUPS business that's almost all passive but he says there's going to be a continuing demand\nFor active strategies especially among the institutional investors that we may go into a period where active funds do better and in particular the kind of active funds that are run by Oppenheimer which are mostly invested insecurities outside the United states\nAnd so when you look at this deal Charlie there's been a lot of consolidation across the asset management business what is it about this when that's different uh especially emitted as I say all this are getting ... getting together that's happening\nWell I think we will we can find out if it's really different chase and if you looked at the previous deals that have happened in ...

their respects victims memorial across Russia and Ukraine\nAnd what we learned is that in May of this year Seventy eight thousand people had their party changed on their voter registration without their consent\nAnd then as you mentioned a month ago we learnt twenty three thousand people were registered to vote was incorrect information right two weeks ago we learned about three thousand people added to the voter rolls but we're not supposed to be on the voter rolls\nHe thousand people added to the voter rolls who were not supposed to be on the voter rolls like they had opted out or something like that\nAnd then we just learned last week about Fifteen hundred people adding to the voter rolls who were in eligible to vote and told us over a hundred thousand incorrect voter registrations none as a result of this motor voter program\nAnd let me interrupt you there how do you how do you fix this why just tell me why are you the right person to ensure integrity in California's election system and and less of these these issues that you just described\nHow do you I\nI'm a ... I'm an election law turnout was one of the first attorneys that they flew into Wisconsin during the presidential recount so I actually have experience with California election law I have experience ah in recounts and counting ballots I've worked with the procedures of counting ballots I work\nWith the election laws in court and so I Am\nVery unique when it comes to secretary of state usually a secretary of state is somebody who was a career politician a professional politician who's just using it as a stepping stone to the next bigger and greater political office\nI'm coming at this as an election law attorney here in California we have the third worst elections in the United states of America and so I was recruited by a bunch of election law attorney saying hey\nWe need to restore integrity to our elections here in California we need somebody who actually understand elections understands election procedure and so to answer your question what could we have done differently\nNumber one we needed to pass regulations and how the secretary of state was going to maintain the voter rolls and regularly review these voter rolls so that when DMV per\nPresented voter registration information that that information was filtered to make sure that the people were properly registered to vote there were no policies put in place to remove non citizens instead what the secretary of state is just what ever\nDNV said that went in and what we learned is that they didn't properly passed the data they didn't properly think through all the things that people could do\nLike people may owned businesses and they may have business car Irish and they register those business ... business address as\nWell with a DMV automatic motor voter registration that people are not registered to vote at their business which is against the law\nAnd so what we had as they did not stop and think through all the scenarios of where people work why people were working with a DMV and the DMV is working on very old data bases so they didn't properly make sure that these two databases were\nAre able to work with each other and they didn't make sure that the county's can work with the state's website it's just really been a failure and it's not the fault of well it is the fault the DMV but it's mainly the fault of the secretary of veterans because he's the one who is to maintain the voter rolls ...\nLet me let me bring up another issue there's the DMV issue but then just yesterday Republican candidate for governor of California John Cox told me that there are reports of democratic operatives\nCollecting voter registrations are essentially from people who may or may not know what they're signing up for some in some elderly homes for example and he's calling a ballot harvesting is not new about his ballot harvesting a problem that you're worried about it and how how do you police that\nYes it is a new law a new law that came into effect this year that as allowing\nThese are used to be that you know a person can only get a couple ballot say you had to sign and all that but now they can actually harvest hundreds of thousands there are people acting going door to door especially with a appears elderly community knocking on the door and chain please hand we're about I'm going to be turning in for you\nAnd uh\nMy warning to anybody out there is he your ballot you do not have to give it to anybody ah you know yes it is a felony for them not to turn into your ballot but ah how do you know whether they turn in your ... you're going to create more problems for yourself then you need to\nLet me let me ask you this non citizens voting or when I go to more quickly than non citizen voting a Latino voters are not showing up at the polls as some Democrats would like them to have in states like California who in\nCastro the uh the mayor of San Antonio ... said that they are now it's a full massive and sustained effort to uh to get these Latino is registered\nIn turning out uh on November ... so as a member of the party in power right now if elected how do you work with Democrats in California to make sure that everything is on the up and up and then everything is legal\nSecretary of state as a chief election officer they are responsible for maintaining the voter rolls so what we need to do is we need a properly compare our voting rules with other government databases to make sure that we have the accurate information and make sure that people are registering to vote at where\nThe actor reside but also compare with driver's license data\nA department of homeland security data to make sure that the people who are registering to vote are actually eligible to vote\nAnd so it is critical that we have integrity in our system that\nYou regularly maintain the voter rolls so that only those people eligible to vote are on the voter rolls\nBut that every\nLegal ballot kept it properly counted\nAll right well we've got your website up on the screen and tell her viewers what they can find there and how you're going to continue to a fight until election day to make sure that the folks that are voting or legal and then of
