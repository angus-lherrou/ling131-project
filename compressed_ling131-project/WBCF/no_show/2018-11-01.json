give us that story the president now saying I might actually send more people to the border than I thought I was going\nFrom writers you as president Donald Trump stand on Wednesday the United states could stand as many at Fifteen thousand troops to the border with Mexico and behind the stance against the caravan of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America as far as the caravan is concerned our military is out will go up to anywhere between ten and Fifteen thousand military personnel\nOn top of border patrol ice and everybody else at the border Trump told reporters at the White House\nAnd it took the ministry and she's on Monday but number of troops in aimed to send to the border number fifty two hundred\nAnd that's not to use an immigration as an issue to motivate Republican donors ahead to November ... elections next week\nOr Republicans will think inane pain control on those congressional chambers and the presidential candidate before the U.S election in two thousand sixteen Trump promised to harden immigration laws and build a wall along the southern border with Mexico but implementation and the signature campaign promise has been slow\nA caravan of Central American migrants estimated to number at least thirty five hundred people left Honduras and then October and is now in southern Mexico on its way to the U.S border\n\nDid you want to tell people what you would you wrote me on the Facebook [laughter] sullen joke is Lewis and people have to understand that you\nAre not as nice as you pretend on the radio and that's not to I Am I just think they gave me a hard time and every once in awhile hey let's talk more about the fourteenth amendment please pretty pleased ... veterinary lock you up and then for you and your response\nYou know some of the ... when you tell me and my response was that's not nice don't believe me [laughter] irresponsible a shot at it might have\nBeen well you may have lands yeah because I wasn't going to recall you of the main story ... ...\n... ... so there you go ah the president might be sending a whole lot more troops there and and again we should have a show of force on the border we should let people know who are more want to be invaders\nBad we're not going to just stand by allowed to happen no matter how solved the left wants to the the border to be no matter how you know the more compassionate we have to accept them they need a I saw somebody say that today on one of the tweets I saved up and my answer was how many of these people are you going to walk\nHim into your home how many because listen there are people in need in this country we should take care of her own first but here's a quick question was a guy at the corner right terminal left to go to my gym every day and the guy standing there he told him to sign um help or whatever you can do right you got\nThe list of issues why he has to stay on the corner instead of going through the McDonald's across the street and asked to to get a job at minimum wage to start building yourself back up he looks able bodied standing there all the time he walked back and forth the looks right to you I Want some money\nMeans let me ask one of these liberals these bleeding heart to say we're not compassionate of will accept everybody who's breaking for the border\nWill you take that guy from the corner better question if that guy comes to your house\nPushes his way into the door grabs some food out of your refrigerator makes themselves from coffee and puts on his favorite TV show is he sits on your couch are you going to say well I have to do it I have more than he does I'm compassionate he deserves my stuff\nI have too much stuff and he has no stuff and he just wants a better life I'm guessing nobody on either side another right so I wouldn't say that's okay but even though some elect wouldn't say that's OK\nWhen you see far left is like Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook building a six foot wall around who's estate in Hawaii and makes you say to yourself or other they worked for a while but they were they weren't for enforcement at the border\nWhen you see people living in in gated communities which is fine build a wall and blaming the gated community just there'll be a hypocrite when you talk about you know what it is that's going on\nYou know when you see the Obamas they're six or eight million dollar house in the DC area that's surrounded by you know security and they've got you know Secret Service all the time they're not accepting any of these caravan people\nAccepting the homeless people in in Washington DC to come and take their stuff because they have too much\nWater that compassionate not compassionate [noise]\nWhy not why not just allow them to have your stuff\nIf you're a liberal and you're a bleeding heart and usually open borders and we stole half of Mexico like\nRobert Francis Beto O'Rourke says\nTell everybody in the caravan to come and stay with you I saw this Mimi carry that if I was actually pretty appropriate mhm\nIt was I think it was an open letter to to those in the caravan there are plenty of people in the United states would like to help you you can find them by looking for the ... and the front yard\nHow would that be something at when\nYou're stuck on the door I see the people to sign them [laughter]\nI think that would be all areas because they're all all the crap is what they are there in the middle of it and they don't want this in their house they just want to say as a society we should have or you could have bought them\nPut them in your guest room I'd area it's eight at eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com I'm going to be Emma Michelle from campus reformed at old when we come back on Halloween and PC keeping writer\nThe school actually admit that it doesn't have the power to go after students and to penalize them if they wear a costume that the school dings races so it's pretty ridiculous at the school poses these things as serious imposes them as these rules that must be followed\nWhen they even admit they admitted to campus reform we're not going to go after students who break the rules so they admit that it's ridiculous and that it can't be enforced because it's not doing anything wrong frankly\nUh so it's it just shows how the left is basically creating problems so that they can be the ones to offer this illusion\nThat they're trying to ... to not being a Mexican do go which dish dishes but I'm In San Antonio Texas should be ... percent Hispanic mainly Mexican and ethnicity and of course talk too much you know one of the radio or television showed\nTacos are not Mexican I Would be in trouble you realize oh ... or ... them or it's it's ... through their which talked about would produce doing at Michigan State then will flow chart what is Princeton doing\nPrinceton has actually released from the student government a checklist for a safe and inclusive Halloween and some of the questions that asks on there are pretty ridiculous an obvious things uh one of them talks about how if you're wearing a costume that makes a joke out of a cultural group then you are racist and you\nShouldn't be wearing costume and it's actually unsafe unsafe by the school and I don't think it's so much the fact that they're saying hey be careful what you're wearing be careful not to wear this costs down I guess the fact that they're actually releasing a checklist so these are Princeton student we can assume that they're pretty smart students generally um uh yeah well\nIf you've ever well good for the job for a long term Princeton is going down a few rooms you might it might but the good\nI mean it's an Ivy League school so it can at least assume that there is some degree of smart in these students we should at least be able to assume that there is something there and yet the school is coming out with these checklist telling students hey make sure that you do X Y Z before here where\nAll the way in costume which in general is supposed to be something that's fun and light hearted joke itself so\nI think they're turning things way too serious way too easily and it's pretty unfortunate to see because Halloween is fun it's a fun holiday students should be allowed the students and you know frankly the schools are not giving them the liberty to do that\nIt's a new show do you understand ...\n... if you're going to do to get through from that old everyday like I Do a job you know ... or ... or ... your problem is and and to write this problem to have\nTheir smart people do really worked ... or to democratic get into Princeton and then the the the the administration the faculty member at Princeton showed you show stupid\nAre to tell you not to do this that children would reach out and so\nYeah I mean essentially the school and say hey I Know you work super her to get here I Know you did well on your SAT's you wrote a really impressive admissions essay but just so you know we don't trust you to wear an appropriate Halloween costumes [laughter] it's I think it\nAs an adult you should be able to make those decisions yourself and if you choose to wear something stupid you will you know you'll be the one to bear the brunt of those social repercussions do I don't think it's the school's job to be police\nThing that and ultimately schools are there to educate students they're there to teach them skills for the workforce I think policing what's going on on Halloween outside of the classroom is really just not what they should be in the business of doing\nCould not agree with you move it gives you some every day but I Do which I Am on the show we went from Michigan to ah to New Jersey and that was due to Utah um what what is the University of Utah do use it is different than what we've heard so far\nSlightly but it really fits into the same larger pattern here at the University of Utah held an event called my culture is not your costs down which is fair enough but I Would think most students could be able to tell the difference between a culture and the cost and when I don't think it's\nThat crazy distinction to know already or to try to make\nSo the ah the school is holding these events and actually as a follow up to the event it released a new term which is different from cultural appropriation which is the one that we always hear that we've heard it a million times at this point they actually coined a new term\nWhich is cultural co opt Haitian ocean which essentially seems to me the same thing to do that they keep ... keep reinventing the PC will\nWhere they're saying cultural cooperation is when you take something from another culture\nAnd you only take that one thing without taking the whole context so the example that they use is a girl who dresses as an Indian for Halloween because he thinks that\nLook cool they call that cultural ... so story time for you when I was a kid I dress up as ... for Halloween so I Know I Would be in big trouble if I did that now but as a kid she's an American hero she Lewis and Clark\nOr when they were on the trail she help them with navigation finding food she helped them stay alive and I'm from Oregon our state may not exist if it weren't for her so she's she's still the hero where I'm from all my friends loved it my teachers loved it\nIf I were that same costume for the same reason on the college campus today I Would be you were by the left\nCultural ... station or whatever it is they're calling it now it's pretty fortunate see because they do think there are people that Jenny you only want to honor other cultures but they're not allowed to do that without being called a racist or without someone screaming cultural appropriation so\nPretty fortunate the scene because it gets to a point where you are being put into a box and you cannot take things from other cultures outside of your own merits of the\nWizardry to me is that the way that it was worded once it's called ...\nAnd where would you interesting to me is that the way that it was worded was this cultural ... not that that's really a word but it is that\nIf you don't do it in context so what does that mean if I decide that I'm going to be whatever chief you know ... or whatever for Halloween do I have to have\nReal a Native American or American indian family members around me village and contacts that I can get away with it what what is it do you even know what that means that it has to be context out how do you put in context being second Joya\nWhat's funny is they don't get very much contact or explaining that you need to have contacts so I can only assume that they would expect you to bulldoze their house and put up a TBN God he wanted to be getting ball or you know if I wanted to be exactly the way I Would have to walk to work every day instead of driving my car\nUm I I don't really understand why they do now [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nBut it's it's really do I'm Glad that you that you have a hard time explaining it because it's unexplainable would they ... what what happens on the left is they put as many words as they possibly can and there and Obama was really good at that he will be asked a question at a\nAt a town hall or in a press coverage and it would give us twenty seven hundred words a dissertation as an answer and if you broke it down he really said nothing but many shut a lot of words I think they're trying to get away with your\nIt's our enemy shell she's program director over at\nCuba's reformed up or go to that website do you mean about a minute if you don't mind him on on on Kevin Phillips going out\nAnd asking people on college campuses\nUh about the caravan what your thoughts are on the care of him\nThat the leadership and campus reform part of what we do is we send our speakers a college campus at your own gauge with students and we send them out making videos and what the student opinion is on current issues and it's impossible to ignore one of the biggest issue as recently as the care of and that the opt out\nAnd that's coming out through Mexico right now can walk in Mexico\nAnd it's pretty interesting to see what do you think about that because they say there was one girl that bad yeah I think we should let them all and and he said OK well\nIs there anyone we shouldn't let in and she goes oh I don't know maybe not these and it's like okay well how how would we determined that she goes well I don't know maybe it's just\nA risk that will have to take a while I think I think students really don't understand also who's in charge of immigration on Congress is in charge of you know immigration policy that it's not something that Donald Trump shiver\nOnly be blamed for and they they really keep going after and the executive branch here they they have all these issues with ice\nI make the rules their job is just to enforce them right it would be like going after your local police for enforcing the laws that your local legislators had put into place sell so many it's thank you I think it's pretty ridiculous to the college students\nUm blaming one person or one administration for these problems that had been written for so long in Congress this is a solution that Congress needs to come up with\nAnd I think it's really disappointing to see that college students really there's just a lack of understanding that\nIt really it's really an professors to be honest with you because they purposely or either filling their heads with us indoctrinated crab or they're not teaching them you know truly what's going on they don't seem to even understand ship it to our government works it's weird\nIt's very true there's a lot of students that never actually have to take an American history course we covered awhile back George, Washington university for history major is no longer required American history for the students who are majoring in history so it's pretty dismayed to see I think it's really important\nOr nothing can and just say this and to understand the way our country works so that when you are dissatisfied with their government you know the best course of action to take and I think that most Republicans are pretty well informed on whereas most Democrats or not and it it's upsetting because\nWe see any Democrat students on these really liberal ... ... students ... when they don't think they kind of tend to protest they\nHave a mob or as you know the more conservative libertarian didn't they just go to vote so I think we're going to Seattle I meant terms coming up here and just about a week um we're going to see what the turnout is there and we're going to see what ends up happening but I think it really just comes down to what do you do when you're satisfied it seems like

Gordon Chang the Daily Beast in summer\nThere was a front page piece in the New York times about a report that up to one million weaker ... those are the turkey the people's\nOf shin John province in China east Turk establish a separate republic conquered by the Maoists in the late Nineteen forties up to one million leakers\nOr worship for Muslims have been detained in ... in concentration camps one million\nOne million\nThe Chinese authorities the PR see the ... is that Xi Jinping\nAnd his gang denied just lied straight up not happening you you've been misinformed well that's changed they no longer did not\nThey're what they're saying is worse so we're going to Nouri Terkel former president of the week or American Association\nTo help us understand what the latest from the PR see about their aggression what the latest explanation is\nNormally a very good evening to you okay they now admit that it exists and that the reporting is accurate you have been with us for many years talking about the persecution of the week goes by the Chinese authorities the bullies who claim that the weaker is attacked them with knives so they gunned down five or ten or Fifteen people\nAnd execute there were survivors immediately\nThat was that this is now what is the latest explanation for up to one million people detained against their will\nOr getting me John thank you for having me on your show again uh\nThe the Chinese government has been a try to come up with a a a Congress strategy to a quote unquote tried to explain to the world wide today a heck of a a engage and twenty first century and not the style catching fish in camps so uh\nThe UN a handle a call them out in August the Chinese government has a big trying so hard and the different ways uh through their own publication and cook again that materials to\nA one normalize quote unquote and then to legalize their um mass detention and criminalization of the week of people based on their ethnicity and religious practices now let's look at the Chinese government's loading the narrative is pretty clear\nAh their actions have been widely reported a so let's look at\nAh their actions have been widely reported\nA so let's look at their motive\nTheir number one motive for the Chinese government or in other words unstated goal is to achieve the China Dream is belt and road initiative as a Robert Kaplan pointed out in his essay on the wall Street Journal the eastern time there's a big chunk of land\nThat can either make the Chinese a lot of the Chinese to get access to your Asia or block the rage of access so the Chinese government\nWanted to completely eh eh eh took control over not only the territory of the properties of the week with people but also the ... because of that ah the livelihood including the Turkish people and then the to the Chinese government wanted to avoid\nA by you know their self fulfilling prophecy that they have created\nThat all the rigors at the ... national identity eventually will be a potential for them so it it is truly a fantasy that they have a a a have been reactive through brutal policies and then the third\nThe Chinese government has been very racist or this whole thing as a racist character\nThe reason that we believe and and this has been said by any a a China scholars we're experts that no government uh in the twenty first century it was called somebody's ethnic ideology as the as a a a cancerous tumor\nAnd no government around the world called Islam as a mental disease\nAnd also the Chinese government are having trouble to understand that their way of life to hunt Chinese people's way of life their culture the language they called a beep truck prince and life\nIs not something universal and and they shouldn't be a imposed on people like to ... send the weakest so oftentimes the Chinese government um\n... tried to tell the world that this was all about security social stability but you don't walk up forty eight a well known academics\nSoccer player religious figures business leaders flying through ... musician ... claim that you're fighting against separate there's almost three evil forces it does it you know make no sense at all so\nThe Chinese government said this was about security but when you carefully that men their policy their behaviors uh it it clearly suggests that the there is all about you think this was all about Communist Party this is all about China's a struggle to dominate the world and this is all about imposing\nChinese language Chinese culture by for if you don't accept\nWill pick you out and in addition to what we have been cover\nSome heartbreaking heart wrenching stories have been told recently a scholar based in Seattle wrote a if a published and as long as the ... investigative report on foreign policy in China file that basically suggests that one million out one million in\nOne million up means the Chinese government locked up a certain age group bank or the individuals born in Nineteen eighty and Ninety Ninety and intellectual and old other elite from the suicide thing\nAnd then they falling those homes those bedrooms those dining tables where Chinese cut Greg or what they're coming into the legal life so it is it is it is a dreadful situation that we've experienced that we go home town we ... a town or\nCity like a ghost town these days\nWe could businesses have been or have been bankrupt because the owners have been locked up so the narrative is clear it is time for action\nGordon thank God that the United states government has been very outspoken Trump stations because they're outspoken and we have some congressional leaders which is Marco Rubio and Christopher Smith already be in the process of introducing legislation\nI Wonder if I Want I Want to garden on one Gordon to enter here Gordon is is this story challenge used to challenge Xi Jinping routinely\nWill no unfortunately not inside China that's just not possible but outside China yes of course it is because this is a crime against humanity and something's got to be done about it the officials who are responsible for this need to be sanctioned and that includes ... himself\nSo when ... Xi Jinping or his lieutenant show up at international bodies to talk about global warming or some other utopian version of their reality\nThey they can be challenged by a the United states and its allies\nAbsolutely especially those who are in the chain of command been these camps all the way up to ...\n... the former president of the week or American Association he speaks very carefully up the facts about persecution that is right now the major story for China the major story Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John ...\n\nCampaigns lane is on ... Fox News President Trump at the first time in a multi state tour in the days before the midterms in Fort Myers Florida to back Senate candidate Rick Scott in Dubai ... full round Santa\nThis election is about safety and it's also about prosperity\nJobs are growing at their fastest rate ever recorded\nSanta's is locked in a tight race against Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum the president also documented visited Pittsburgh after Saturday's mass shooting at a synagogue after\nThis day of unity and togetherness I came home\nAnd sadly turn on the news and watched\nThat was the strongest year over year again since the second quarter of two thousand and eight the latest data adds to this is a quote\nBroader evidence that wage growth has continued the trend gradually higher over recent corners Monica that's exactly what we've been waiting for to guarantee that the Democrats were wrong to vote against the tax cuts\nAnd Mrs blows is wrong to say it's ... it's the fastest rise in a decade everybody knows this Monica the puzzle is the paychecks are stronger the job opportunities you can leave your job and get a better job\nDoes that get in the polls you think it does so why but these political scientists are telling us it's not it's a non starter because the Democrats so villain eyes Donald Trump people are going to forget why their money in their pocket\n[noise] yeah I I think that analysis is incorrect that people are so you know are so angry I mean certainly there is a segment of the population that is I agree a trumpet hate his guts and are motivated to vote for Democrats simply out of that [noise]\nI also wish that the Republicans that made the economic messaging more front and center\nGoing into next Tuesday they haven't made some candidates have by and large national hold the Republicans haven't done that and it's\nIt's been a source of great frustration for me but I also think that the American people a lot smarter\nThan than depressed give them credit for they do the they're stronger paychecks they see the wage growth they see their job opportunities I think they see greater prosperity in every direction a stronger economy and international position for the country\nThey know who's responsible for that the president and the Republicans and they're likely to reward that I really believe that that is true and it's first vilify Donald Trump I think we're in a whip around situation where they have done it so often\nAnd for so long that people have now tuned it out and they're likely to react in the opposite direction\nThe production by Nancy Pelosi is that she will be the speaker of the house again she guarantees that on the Tonight Show I also SARS say on the Tonight Show without laughing that what we need is a leader who doesn't divide us to bring us together she said this without laughing however political science says that there's merit to Mrs Pelosi's prediction\nThat the house swings to Nancy Pelosi if that happens Monica the worst case scenario is that the house is ... they promised investigations\nThat guaranteed investigation subpoena power in all directions do you believe those investigations will sway the American people to a turning against the man they voted in the end of the into office\nNo in fact I think it will have the exact opposite effect\nThe way the Republican investigations into Bill Clinton in the Nineteen nineties had the opposite effect\nOn people rally around the president even one is polarizing is this one he is still the president of the United states Bill Clinton same thing and the other thing that the two presidents have in common\nIs a stronger economy so they were presiding they both are presiding over big strong economy whether it was in the Nineteen nineties or today and a strong economy a knock elites presidents from a lot of nonsense a lot of investigations and a lot of ... to ...\nBecause people are willing to overlook that when things are good for them and their families\nSo I think you know if we get any Democratic House in my view this will be terrible we will have paralysis but I also think that Donald Trump is never as good as he is when he's got a foil\nNo better foil for Donald Trump that Nancy Pelosi a Democratic House which is overreaching every day with impeachment investigations and the rest so it's likely if that were to happen Trump runs against them for the next two years gets re elected in flip to the house back\nThe Senate or the Senate is looking very favorable for the Republicans it's a good map out possible pickup of too but I Want to concentrate in New Jersey you're a Jersey Girl Monica\nI'm Robert Menendez is a deeply troubled candidate a we know about the investigations are we also know that the uh papers in New Jersey have acknowledged that there's merits of those investigations and are recommending in a blue state that people hold their nose and vote for him and then does\nI'm told that late in the game the national Democrats panic a little bit because they saw him and then does his numbers were weak and they poured three million dollars then to elect him what is your sense Monica will will the liberals of New Jersey vote for a man who has such and such baggage\n[noise] you know I grew up in New Jersey John I Love the Garden State and my mother is still there almost every day she calls me screaming about Sen Menendez [laughter] their frustration that he may God Forbid get reelected New Jersey has long been\nI think and I'm not alone in this assessment that most corrupt state in the union the

China many of purchasing manufacturers index\nIs in it better than expected at fifty fifty point one what is it pointing to what is the metric telling us good morning to enter\nA good evening John the metric is basically saying that the Chinese economy has weakened and why that's important is first of all it means that the Chinese\n... and ... why that's important is first of all it means that the China's gonna buy less goods from the United states which obviously affects\nOur economy and second of all it means that at some point the Chinese leaders have to step in with a flood of cash or are going to be tempted to step in with a flood of cash to get the economy back on its feet [noise]\nUm the question is they'd been holding back on that in fact I've Meyer their strength\nOr because they're concerned about uh too much debt and the economy and too many bad loans going out there\nSo so far we've seen a lot of a restraint on the part of the leaders are but now Bloomberg is reporting are just I think this morning that they ... the central leadership said that they're looking again at stimulus measures and they may do something as early as next week Gordon\nDot US zoom video conferencing\n\n[noise]\nI've done that someone Gordon Chang were very pleased to welcome Scott Harold full political scientist deputy director at the center for Asia Pacific policy at the RAND Corporation\nScott it's a pleasure to speak to you and Gordon guides me immediately we are eager for your thoughts about the meeting between the prime minister of Japan all day\nAnd the prime minister of India and ...\nThey are two parts of what is called the Indo Pacific Claude India\nJapan Australia and the United states all day and an Modi both share democracies are they both have aggressive modern warships what are they what are they what are they looking to do with each other and how does how do they regard China collectively good evening to\nGood evening John Gordon and to your listeners around the world John I'm very happy Halloween to all of you um you know it's a good good point John the or the Japanese and the Indians share both are common values\nAnd also a common threat perception there is a view that is very widely held in both Tokyo and India\nOr that China's aggressive build up its military capabilities and its use of both military\nAnd economic tools as well as its diplomacy are coming at these countries expense including the region\nIn a bit of a danger where uh it's possible Beijing may use coercion and unto on toward influence to try to put these countries national security at risk so you saw the prime minister of Japan visits Beijing where he ... late last week\nVery next day he was back in Tokyo and met with prime minister Modi at the foot of mount Fuji where he invited him to his private residence and signed a host of deals and announced a number of other initiatives all designed to signal a very strong bilateral relationship between Tokyo in New Delhi Gordon\nScott you mentioned that a prime minister Abe's hosted the Indian prime minister at his private home and\nAt the base of mount Fuji um what struck me about all this is that ah when I went to Beijing that it just seemed a little bit stiff of the meeting city had in the Chinese capital\nBut to his relations with Modi were very warm and and this strikes me is is not just the personal relationship but as you point out\nI'm In Japan and India seeing a common interest um if you could talk a little bit about the the warmth of the relationships that has had with ... and the significance of going forward\nYeah I think there is no doubt you know the the Japanese generally and the prime minister in particular do feel a a a very strong sense of shared identity as a democratic country and Asian democracy that has legitimately embraced and built its own version of democracy\nAnd and that shows through and the personal relations between\nThe prime minister and his Indian counterpart but also between other Japanese officials and their Indian counterparts what's not oversell this working with India is still recognized in Japan to eat or work in progress very promising but it has been very promising for a long time so it is not always easy as you've seen\nThey have been negotiating arms sales and other types of a defense cooperation\nFor quite a number of years it's not necessarily the case that this confluence of interest in threat perceptions immediate you read your results that one might hope\nBut there is a great sense of optimism that at least the direction is the right one and that they can build a closer relationship by contrast the Japanese recognize that China's in a very difficult place right now I Believe your previous guest just outlined some of the economic difficulties China's facing gr also of course facing a difficult relationship with\nThe American administration and the recent election in Brazil is likely to put even further pressure on Beijing search Japan recognizes that China's outreach now is almost entirely tactical it's an attempt to alleviate pressure on Beijing not genuinely motivated by any change in thinking of ...\nPressure on Beijing not genuinely motivated by any change in thinking of by Beijing about the grand strategic relationship it wants to have with Japan\nAnd similarly the Japanese recognize that and say okay we'd be happy to work more closely with you on terms that we can accept but we're not going to wreck we're not going to believe that this represents any kind of a sea change or a permanent solution to the problems that led us to the difficult place where they were the two sides were in over the last several years\nScott were told there is a quad Indo Pacific region Claude India Australia Japan and the United states is that aspirational or is that actual\nSo I think it's a great question John you know I I Do think that this was an aspirational about a dozen years ago\nAt that time a there is a four sides there was not entirely a confluence of a belief that China posed a challenge or a threat today I think that is much more strongly recognized and held as a viewer in all four capitals I Will say though that uh there continues to be\nA need to build a practical meat around the bones of the ... dialogue grouping\nOf course do do some military exchanges of exercises and in fact the recent visit by the Indian prime minister to to pan has led to an upgrading in India Japan defense ties with\nMore regular eyes high level contacts including a two plus two dialogue but formally been announced where the Japanese an Indian foreign and defense ministers will meet\nAnd the two sides will work more closely to invest in\nCapabilities that are dual use including a code developing um artificial intelligence and robotics and working more closely or in male male exchanges but to be sure there is much much work left to do and it would be premature to say that the quad has reached its full potential Gordon\nScott you know I listen to you describe the relationship between Japan and India one could say many of the same things between India and the United states it's a great relationship but it's got a long long way to go I mean do you see any parallels there\nOh absolutely I mean I think that the reality within the uh is it is a country with enormous potential\nUh and unfortunately also enormous obstacles to realizing the full measure of that potential\nUh India continues to have a large amount of attachment to its previous or and continues to have not alive policy or a policy that cherishes autonomy and devoid of any kind of a formal alliance relationship with any other country\nThat is in some ways quite limiting of course India also has a large number of captured or a vested interest in its\nDefense industrial base as well as the broader economy that kind of complicated\nBlock or at least make difficult any sort of a deepening of a really meaningful deepening of economic ties including defense industrial ties so I Do think there are a lot of parallels I think that the good thing here is that the U.S and Japan is very close allies are working very closely to try to encourage the Indians\nTo find ways to uh work within their system to try to put pressure\nOr from the outside welcome pressure pressure that new

coming in and out of their [noise] their official results and they're able to understand which which of those ships are actually registered and legal to fish there and which ones aren't clearly not and which ones are questionable and that allows them to\nUse the whatever forces they have in terms of patrol boats to go to the places where there might be trouble\nAnd that's a that's a modest

demonstrate our\nOur uh our interest and those nations the in the cultural exchange that happens when our sailors come ashore [noise] uh the opportunity to get to know is better to sort of have either I interaction with the people I think of something that they really really value and\nFrankly we've we've not done as much of that because for a variety of variety of reasons we have\nHigh end warships that have high end missions and operational requirements for those missions has not subsided so we have to think about different ways there where we can establish that presidents were looking at ways that we can possibly get our\nHospital ships out there again or to do more frequent visits that's another thing that they really really appreciate and helps build a lot of good will also I think we have to\nWe can't really I don't think we can really play a whack a mole strategy here I think we have to become use our creativity and become a little more asymmetric and and uh advance our
