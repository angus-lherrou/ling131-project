about it I Know when people are when I talk to people and I'm like yeah the um we're getting a new host no like oh no oh did you do wrong and it's like no no no this is a great thing because I'm Still going to be here being the producer\nAnd already the interviews that I've heard with you I already really like you have a huge cast of friends that you can reach out to that are in this world that are well beyond\nMy own contacts and I think that\nYou're just gonna be a great fit for this show and ah so you know welcome to this\nYour show and Jeff than is your live\nYou go well you're all you're all like ... you're all stuck with me now so I'm so until it big Kaine comes from off camera and pulls me on yeah right now the chair you know so um anyway one of the things you and I've been talking about I mean\nOne of the other shows on your network as the drive you know where you guys talk about cars a lot and I think there's a big parallel in technology and in audio in particular with the automotive world in the sense of vintage\nYou know I'm just like vintage cars are popular and have always been popular and you you know with with vintage cars you kind of ... you know you revisit those you revisit those cool cars of your youth or you get that part of your youth that you missed out on\nVintage Hi fi as the same thing I mean back in the sixties and seventies there was a lot of\nA number of coal companies many that are still here like Macintosh Moran ... um what a lot of our younger listeners and that don't know is that these companies have a very rich heritage\nAnd you know just like that you know sixty seven Z. twenty eight that you wanted to have when you were a kid in high school there were some really amazing you know audio had almost a golden age in the sixties and seventies\nAnd so you know it's some of it is the sound you know the vintage gear has a little bit warmer a little more romantic sound\nIt also has a really cool look you know the the companies that were making this gear spent a lot of money I mean again just like a lot of the old Cadillacs and Chrysler's and be looks had these big giant chrome bumpers and fins and all of that stuff\nYou know the receivers of the seventies the big Japanese receivers had you know big ...\nSievers of the seventies the big Japanese receivers had you know big giant back lipped tuning dials for the FM tuner and they had all these meat eaters and all these buttons and all these cool knobs and stuff and you know machine the lumina face plates and so it was a very you know it was a very tactile\nExperience as well as an audible experience too and they're you know they're making a big comeback because there's a ton of 'em out there I mean these guys were in the day you know Miranda Macintosh they they produced in pretty great quantity\nSo there's quite a few of them out there so if it's something that you know you'd like a little different tack on how you approach your Hi fi system vintage is pretty cool and it it hasn't gotten to be crazy money yet\nRight no that's one thing that I thought\nIs it's a great way for us to transition over into all the stuff that you're going to be talking about because in this world of technology and specifically sounds technology it's always being upgraded every year there's a new model and people saw sometimes can be afraid to buy because they know that they spend a lot of money now\nThey might spend a lot less next year when it's a year old and it'll\nBe it'll be who they are packed at Costco that thing that you paid five thousand dollars for obey blister pack that costs go for forty nine bucks next ... next year exactly\nSo I think that now if you go back there is you know\nThirty forty fifty years of old gear that you can get\nA lot of the time you know if you can snatch it up and cool places like uh you know thrift stores and things like that you can get extremely valuable stuff for a really you know affordable amounts of money I think that one of the first things that I noticed about getting into the vintage audio\nStuff personally is it's kind of like a getting into like a new t._v. where like they can't advertise to you on your current TV how good the pictures on the new t._v. look\nBecause like your TV can't display better and so [laughter] right when you get when you get a a record player or something like that and you actually\nTo you it sounds different it sounds to me it sounds like the musicians or more in the room with you know yeah like sense yeah yeah definitely but that's something that you can't\nHear before you buy online\nRight right and they all you know again just like cars just like cameras watches all of these products have I guess if you will a different personality\nYou know and so it's buying it a couple of pieces of vintage gear is I think is as much a a style or environmental choice as it is\nPerformance you know and and I think it's cool too because you know we all we all live in the Pacific northwest here so we're all kinds of closet tree hugger environmentalist [laughter] you know it's kind of cool to keep something working instead of just throwing it in a landfill you know I think there's\nBrought you buddy ad council and it's pre diabetes awareness partners but he can say that in reverse\n[noise] news talk one easy of radio

about headphone [noise]\nReally popular topic in audio both consumer high end headphones seem to have\nTaken the world by storm in the last couple of years becoming you know a whole nother segment of the audio world so I've got wider good field from sim audio in Montreal and they are known for\nAn award winning line of amplifiers pre amplifiers deck CD players\nAnd they've just made the move into the ... into the headphone world with two in two headphone amplifiers the ha for thirty and the two thirty ha de so ah we're going to talk to I Know about some of the development and what what led them down that path\nMorning Jeff Hi Lana we got into the um [noise] we decided to pursue at fat camp fire market because like it's a massive growing market huge potential\nMatter of fact I often refer to it as a headphone universe headphone world because it would be short changing the size of this market\nOur own it true it really is I mean it really I mean who Lionel and I are both a little bit older audio files and you know back in our day or a pair of costs headphones inexpensive pair of headphones was about eighty nine bucks I mean nowadays you can buy a pair of headphones for five thousand dollars\nOr more [laughter] yeah yeah and and with that you need a really high quality headphone amplifier to get the performance out of those headphones and that's where you come in line all\nYes well we got into this because we already had the engineering know how and the facility to pursue endeavor like this and one of the goals of our company ... at our products is to bridge the emotional connection between the customer and his or her music\nAnd when you listen to music through headphones it's a very personal experience probably one of the best ways to achieve that goal\nYou know when people connect with their music on an emotional level they're going to want to listen to music more often and it's been Scientifically Proven there's so many studies that have demonstrated that there's so many benefits one health listening to music so\nWell in so many of us to are often stuck on airplanes you know we're you know you're just like you know just like the iPad\nBecame popular a few years back you know first you didn't see anybody on the plane with an iPhone or an army with an eye pad and you know now you see everybody with with decent headphones on on the plane so it's just natural take them home and plug them into your home system as well\nCorrect yeah it's completely ... through five years ago the scene and when you get onto an airplane is complete opposite of what you used to see and interestingly the first thing people do when I get into this sheet on a plane to his wife are amount is you see people\nActually close and we were were gardener many new customers and it cuts a new customers are discovering what else we have to offer and some of them are taken the plunge and their button to some of our other part of categories as well so I'm a I guess say marketing perspective\nIt's just getting into this universe has helped us expose are glad far beyond the traditional borders of high performance audio so it's been it's been a boon for our success absolutely well\nI Know I certainly see them quite a few places when I've gone to ... you know headphone meats and headphone events you're pretty well represented there well Lionel running up

feel from sim audio makers of fine\nAudio products from the the lovely planet of Canada and um he's going to tell us a little bit more we've been talking about their new headphone amplifiers very high quality very high performance so why not go back to back to our discussion\nYou've got you know you've got kind of an entry level you know it's it's it's like going a Burger King you know you've got kids meals small regular large in super size I think you got kind of the regular in super size with the two thirty in the four thirty and um\nHave you have you seen both of these I mean there's a pretty big jump in price you know one is Fifteen hundred dollars one is almost four thousand dollars depending give or take depending on how you can figure it have these been selling equally well or has one you know as one really have you seen a trend there with what's what's moving up the door\nWhen we watch the four thirty ha back in a mid two thousand and four and only began shipping or after a summer and it's done well says came available\nAnd since we watch less expensive to thirty ha de what shop and the fall two thousand and Fifteen cents twelve months later for thirty ha is better\nThan the two thirty electrics as the one that's been a hit since day one and we actually went into soccer on occasion but only for a very short periods of time obviously we're going to sell more to thirties enforcers truly based on our our respective price points\nThe biggest differences between the two models I think it's important to point out is for thirty is a fully balanced unit\nThat has multiple pre amplifier multiple inputs they use it as a pre apple fire like you mentioned before it also offers a lot more power output it'll essentially tried any headphones on the market and you're not careful\nMore power output it'll essentially tried any headphones on the market and you're not careful you can [laughter]\nYou like just\nBlocks the set of headphones into oblivion but ... people that by you and it's like this are fully aware of that they don't we've never had issues with people complaining it's all very good [laughter] so there there's your main difference I mean triple the prices buying you a lot more power\nFlexibility and also the the the\nSilly to have a balanced a connectivity\nWith a set of headphones which uh you want to elaborate on that little that you'll free to do so because I Know you see lots and lots of different ... for Apple fires lots of different headphones\nWhile I think you know I think we're going to leave that the getting that geeky with headphones we're going to leave it for another for another full segment but you know one thing that is worth pointing out because you know you might be sitting there in the

already you're already you know [noise]\nGonna have to leave at five thirty in the morning to get here you know my God\nOh well I Hope you're having a good day on the highway [laughter] we're here we made it and I'm Dr ... blue will be our guest today there are some stories trending that uh it's interesting to watch how things ebb and flow with certain stories\nAre for example all this business about\nWith certain stories are for example all this business about while sitting is the new smoking ... well let me see if I take two people one smokes why a lot and one sits a lot I'm going to put my money or the who's gonna who's gonna\nBut will die first all\nThe smoker sitting in the new smoking while I don't know about that\nI'm not so sure smoking is that the damage that oh please but nevertheless that theme is\nCoupled with the theme upstanding and now we have standing desks we have desks that are um\nTreadmills are and what not well there's a story about a study some work trending that says well let's re think that a little bit so we'll take a look at that\nAnd a lunch and meets processed meats\nYou've heard me talk about this before and people keep saying wow you know\nEating meat not a bad thing eating meat well that's not the whole story the question becomes it's not just eating meat it's what kind of meat there was a study trending the about eating\nSomething Michael dark a host of let's talk nutrition on this station you can get more information about the show on my Web site at let's talk to the tradition dot com that's led to talk of nutrition dot com\n\n\n\n\nThis is Dr Michael ... and you're listening to let's talk contrition on this station if you want to find out more about the show is on my Web site at less talk nutrition dot

wisdom year three miners in internal Clinton laptop nutrition on the Web that laptop nutrition dot com back from the brain that lets rejoined Dr Michael Garner go\n\nBack to ... you should say [laughter]\nYou shouldn't use sense [laughter]\nBush and\nWell maybe ... [laughter] for long periods of time maybe neither this new study is suggesting\nThat neither\nSitting for long periods of time standing for long periods of time you\nKnow what works better than standing\nAccording to this piece of research moving you gotta keep moving it's not ... this this study came out it was I'm\nTwenty seven team polishing the American Journal of epidemiology seven thousand people it's a big sample they tracked him over twelve years longitudinal study\nFound that workers who primarily stand had double or risk double the risk of heart disease as sitting workers\nWait a minute so standing [laughter] so standing you see there's yet another deleterious effect also standing for long periods of time compressed is the spine\nAnd causes swelling in your feet and ankles also you're fighting gravity all the time to get the blood out of your feet and so hours of standing increases your risk right\nMhm [noise] um\nCardiovascular problems your heart has to work harder like you get very ... veins there are no picnic and ... and the bank\nLike you get very ... veins there no picnic and ... and ...\nSo there yet there is some evidence to suggest as standing is even\n\nJust a deleterious is setting\nThe actually reminds me of our gas that's coming up Dr Kate Rowe and blue member uh she uh when she got done with us one day she was on her treadmill\nWhile she was talking to us and walking pretty much the entire time she was moving yeah I mean that's standing but you're you're moving and uh but I don't know if if you can have a treadmill desk I don't think I could concentrate on walking and doing my job at the same time me either me either Steven I see it at the gym all the time so it's like what do you do I mean I guess maybe\nYou could Institute a every Fifteen minutes get up and take a walk around the building type of thing\nYes I this is a this is a picture of booking and the reason why I bring this up is because you brought up very ... veins and heart problems if you go to this guy right here you see this guy yeah that is the booking clerk there's a three of 'em they stand there all day twelve hour shifts they do it for on for off\nAnd they had the highest turnover of anybody\nAt the sheriff's office inside the jail\nBecause they end up getting a foot knee and very because fans problems really and so every year they have they have a hard time trying to fill this this position right here\nSo these are all the inmates and then but if you noticed there and booking the picture I'm showing you there is no desks for the ... there are no desks\nIt's all standing now yeah wow wow\nThe remedy seems to be about an hour of exercise today can counteract the health dangers of sitting\nOne's twenty sixteen study found that a five minute joggers speed walk every hour improves mood and decreases the end of the day food cravings well\nLet's be realistic you're working in a corporate office is pretty hard every hour to get up and go jog somewhere mhm\nRight\nTake the stairs is a good idea [laughter] I Know somebody who who during lunch time will climb stairs up and down in the building work on a tall building\n... and she does the stairs but you got friends in Manhattan that yes it yeah so do the stairs that's their exercise and put their sneakers on their their Nike's or whatever and they'll do stairs for thirty forty minutes\nUp and down [noise]\nAs they're recommending that you keep moving walk even if you walk for two minutes every hour your risk of early death is lower by a third\nStanford University researchers found and twenty fourteen that walking increases one create one creative output [laughter] increases ones creative\nOutput by sixty percent when I'm working I get up\nOne of the reasons why I bought the house I just did it had in the bill is it was bigger and it has space I can I can get up I can walk I can walk around I can go outside I'm In a nice spot it's beautiful there\nAnd I would that was all on my mind at when I purchased a home\nYou know I I can work as much as eight twelve hours a day and I and I still do and I can't be sitting all that time\nSo I figure it out I Walk I'll get up and I walk I Walk around the neighborhood which is beautiful\nAnd where I live it's there's a natural preserves and whatnot so that's what I Do and I get up every hour and a half every hour every couple of hours I'll get up and walk Fifteen minutes or so\nAgo back makes them T go sit work it up again that's what I Do that's how I Do it so I'm right in line with the research\nWe were\nNaturally select we naturally selected to keep\nMoving\nSo it's not standing unto itself I mean maybe standing is a little better maybe\nBut it's certainly um I I'm not and I'm not lining up with sitting is the new smoking our line up with a total sedentary life is not good for you\nAnd\nAnd standing for hours on end I'm not so sure about that either the research seems there's not much here\nIs just bits and pieces the best prescription here is to keep moving keep moving\nDon't sit too long don't stand too long you know Goldilocks porridge was du ... just

a\nI think you should under yeah maybe your candidate to do that Dr tape is going to explain then we'll take a call in a moment from Lansdale, Pennsylvania\nDr Kate what would be the circumstances under which somebody would take a multiple vitamin and mineral\nFive I think a better question is what would be the circumstances under which somebody would take one it's just simple um\nHealth insurance I think you can think of it as that way and in ... in terms of bridging that gap between our daily diet and making sure that we have optimal level of those individual nutrients at you know vitamins and minerals end in in them you know most current\nA sophisticated multi vitamin you're getting a lot more than that you know whole foods um for example ... come from whole foods the plant based compounds that\nWe know arch vitamins and minerals per se but we have a you know they have health benefits for us and so it really can make a difference does those micro nutrients to be getting them in everyday\nMhm or\nDoes it make a difference in terms of delivery system powder\nPill liquid what do you think\n[noise] the formula itself\nAnd the individual components of the formula generally make a bigger difference than whether that formula is in a powder or liquid or a capital a lot of people think that just because you're formulas a liquid that automatically better or better absorb and not not necessarily the case\nI you know I'm\nMinerals are not generally water soluble whether you're putting them in a liquid or or a tablet and so that will increase or adoption but other things will and other aspects of your formula and so that's really more important\nMhm let's go to Lansdale, Pennsylvania right outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is that how long are held their talent high how long how are you today\nFined Cosco good questions sure I'm the same thing the oil I just bought a bottle of that yes molesting to your show is great and uh\nI don't know when I asked them how do I take it there's no directions on the bottle and they said any time now is it better to take it on an empty stomach far with\nUm it does make a difference when you take it because it depends on the person some people respond differently to that compound some people\nPerson some people respond differently to that compound some people take it at night or late in the day and have difficulty sleeping\nOthers will then has they need to take it early in the day and a and they ... they get a better effect so again you know a an abundance of caution and it's probably better to take it earlier in the day I'm for you and then how much I Would just to start with\nFollow the recommended dosage on the bottle or one\nKept from day okay you start with that and then the next thing is go to the website is it um I'll mention another another brand is it a ... from Stevie sciences\nYes okay was it the gold the green or the ... the red kept Bob\nLabel as cold go\nOK I recommend you go to

fascinating area I think we've just scratched the surface of our understanding of what it can get I think it's really been under study to find ...\nYeah it it you know it wasn't a Helen wasn't long ago where scientists figured out that we had a system called the ... system\nIt's amazing to me that we you know and at the anatomy of the human you would think we would have come uncovered most of what they are needed to be known but it was only in the early nineties when the ... system and I put this in quotes was discovered\nIn the human body a it turns out to be one of the most in my anatomy and physiology courses I never the word and do can nab annoyed never appeared that alone and the ... system so they're going to have to rewrite these books are and to include that system and a\n...

when black men et cetera we all can get osteoporosis all of us are written [noise] um but I found it fascinating that I was asked to speak on a cultural difference on how to approach a patient\nAnd I commend them before I started you know open with a joke or I talk about something you know completely off topic and I you know completely just I don't know\nFor people to sleep before we even get to the needs of the ... budget to stop and say you guys I you know well done you know we need to you know in medicine look at everybody as individual\nYou cannot just lump everybody in the group and the funny thing is is one of the papers I read said many Asians feel that they are kind of lumped into a group and their you know looked upon as the same when they have individuality and they do\nYeah I I keep saying that you can't give an African American male the same blood pressure medication and expected to have the exact same effect as it would\nWork in a Caucasian male or a Caucasian female or a

vaccinated but then when you come to America it's very hard to screen\nFor somebody who was who was back then you have to do a blood test hepatitis B. is very common and many of the Asian countries and you get a ... you get it you got it through through the woman with their mom and so many people are carriers of hepatitis B\nO. that it does in the ... his Nevada I like what you said that that not jumping to conclusions about all of them\nThat I'm not getting any sounds metal Daniel you there and it's\nLike they crack in their brain or the other events that are coming here I'm Sorry on his

under control every country you want to live in where everybody just anybody any uh who are in the woodwork comes on and it's going to use anything automatically you're guilty let's say heck\nAnd that seems afterwards setting\nOut to be stuck address you a story\nI'll thank you I Wish I could talk to you live I you must be listening to the show delayed 'em and thank you for leaving your your comment a I Apologize I was having some technical issues on my end um yeah this idea of you being guilty anybody any of us being guilty until proven innocent it does have to change and\nI think you have a lot of people who are looking at this for a cabinet nominations whether they believe it or not or believe pushing for it or not the process that took place and the whole circus that happened where somebody could claim something happened to them\nHow one of the week it's a it's any\nThat probably no evidence at all [noise] having no evidence nothing to corroborate the story to be able to destroy a family and um I mean I you know if he does get nominated and I don't know not a lot of people are playing a violin for him but you know I\nI don't know much about what he did thirty six years ago but I feel pretty confident that he wasn't a serial rapist\nAnd he wasn't a sexual predator I kind of feel confident based on the testimony I heard and if he doesn't get nominated ... no one's going to hire him you know one's gonna I ... I mean he ... the country has gotten so polarized\nThat one\nAccusation of assault is enough to ruin your career ruined her family I mean God Bless his family for going through all this like they did they didn't deserve that and now somebody can say well does it look you know I they report they so if\nThey want to be in the public eye if they want to be a Supreme Court justice I don't remember Olympia Kagan going through all this\nI don't remember sort of my or I don't remember you know ... I don't remember any of them having to go through all this\n\nUh this is just the the this was really really ugly and I think it for ... what is going to comment for shadows that same people are going to get ugly I don't see the Republicans doing this I don't think the Republicans if we get a Democratic president you know a orchestrating\nYou know all this if if and again I Can't accused Democrats of orchestrating that's but I just don't\nSee the same circuits I I just don't and um I I think Democrats have to to new lows now\nWhat was very interesting is a um I Believe a democratic senator had actually move after\nMove forward now a Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia did cross the aisle and gave an I vote for us to move forward with a final vote now\nDoes that mean he is voting for Kevin I could just me and he wants to be done so let's move forward and get it over with Lisa Murkowski however voted no link Murkowski she's supposed to be Republican but I I don't\nI don't really know what her voting record is but you always seems to be the one of the news that kind of stands out\nWhich to me it's kind of concerning because again there's you know when it comes to politics you would think it would be about the country it would be about the party ought to be about the you know and or about your state or about your constituents and said hey you know it it usually ends up being about your career\nOr any of the senators the primary goal of any one of these senators or politicians is to get reelected\nOr to be able to you know keep their base happy such that if they do venture into other politics or take a different seat [noise]\nThey get to remain in public office remaining in public office is one of their main goals then everything else comes later\nMean there were Democrats that couldn't stand the Affordable CARE Act there were like this I don't think it's going to work but it doesn't matter they had to make sure that they abuse their base\nI don't think it's going to work but it doesn't matter they had to make sure that they\nAbuse their base and they were able to you know get reelected so it's\nA it's a collector but unfortunately it's you know one of the better systems that we have in this world and so\nWe make it work so a key vote happen earlier on friday\nWhether it's you know he got the one I vote like I couldn't hear all of them some of them um you know stood and voted and the Democrats forty nine for this to move forward to a full vote\nSo now what's going to happen well they say for the next thirty hours or the next day and a half they get to a debate from what we understand\nThey decided to invoke cloture\nCulture if I'm pronouncing that right\nTo avoid filibustering so a bunch of guys remember that when you stand up there and you could read green eggs and ham remember Ted Cruz did that\nRe during a Twenty one hour marathon in September two thousand Thirteen when he was trying to I'm a stall the health care overall and then send her a strong Thurman in South Carolina He's the one that made filibustered the most famous because he smoked for twenty four hours and Eighteen minutes against the civil rights that\nBack in Nineteen fifty seven I Believe that's according to USA Today [noise] um\nI find it very difficult to go one hour without having to run a pie and I believe there was somebody one woman was filibustering had a catheter in so she could just pee into the catheter\nAnd so a lot about three minutes probably it's a lot of grandstanding and so from what I understand\nThe debate could be unlimited and law as the senators unanimously agree\nAnd unanimously agreed would be a unanimous consent\nSo if they don't want to I'm a ... if they want to let's say bring the vote forward they could unanimous consent to do it right now though for the cabinet nomination they invoked cloture or culture which basically limits the debate I guess it's a parliamentary move under central twenty two\nAnd so what does schedules a final vote on a bill or nomination\nIf you don't invoke cloture then what happens is people can filibuster or just debate endlessly now back in Nineteen Seventy five the Senate agreed to reduce the number of votes required to invoke cloture from sixty seven sixty out of a hundred senators\nThis way to make it easier to end debate\nBut I Believe it was the Democrats in November two thousand Thirteen wanted to change this rule\nBecause getting sick he had a hundred senators the country to divide it most I don't have it so the Democrats and two dozen Thirteen change the rule to just you know simple majority rule to invoke cloture\nSo now the Senate Republicans can use that with Kavanaugh support what the ah the cabinet or a nomination\nSo now the Senate has up to thirty hours to debate before the final vote\nOr one of the uh one of the senators has a wedding to go to I Believe he wants to walk his daughter down the aisle I see on Facebook everybody's asking for 'em I sorry I don't know exactly which uh I forget which senator it is [noise] but uh um everything\nIs asking the daughter to move the wedding no he's not going to move the wedding\nHow then yes I just keeps going on and on so my guess\nI don't understand why they just can't in this day and age\nYou know do a sky provoked [noise]\nFor a proxy vote vote before you leave from the wedding vow to

I'm going to smother them\nDuring the recession [noise] so now we have the younger generation and we leave the younger generation to be robots we need them can be financially secure because we lead them to pay for I was talking to a Democrat the other day that we know\nIt was it was fine it was fine you could talk to a Democrat is fine and we don't pay no no I did not in the valley and that's where the guy that kind of what it's going to the Democrat about please ... ... I was talking to Democrats [noise] and\nHe was saying why don't we do Medicare for all you know for liberty and justice for all Medicare for all and the person at the table said well\nThat could work if we have more money how do you pay for Medicare for all and my argument is okay\nOkay I\nThink we can do a lot better for our seniors on Medicare used to be better but the more people going on Medicare the worse it becomes that's a lot of doctors don't take Medicare anymore because of the oh I'm Sorry we're dying the claim or we're not pain as or whatever [noise] and so\nThe VA system to me is a little bit more of a barometer of or I or or a um\nExample of what national health care would be like and the Wii system as a cluster\nSo Medicare for all might not work\nAnd in order to pay for Medicare for all one reason why I don't think it'll work as we don't have enough people putting in tax dollars we don't have enough people paying taxes so I look to the younger people because I'm going to eventually God willing V. on Medicare\nI I Am scared to death on how little that can be like a senior you guys think I've annoying now oh my gosh 'cause that's when you don't even care care of people think about me but when I'm older I don't know I got to have it is I don't know what the heck I Want\nYou know anyway so I Do worry about the young ones out there\nSo what's going on with increased debt so okay well first tuition now is ridiculous tuition costs a higher than they've ever been the only thing that I think is really stupid and four\nYear degrees are really becoming more rare now the average the greed takes five years five years these four years to get a degree well when you need X number credits all the time they squeeze out another gear\nThat's Viet now\nAnd then they squeeze out another gear that's Viet\nNam worked while going to college I had about three different part time jobs\nAnd in between classes I tutor I Would I Would if I had an hour and a half the twenties cause I went to the for an hour I Would be making money whenever I could nowadays a lot of students don't don't multitask they're you know schools hard they need to be competitive\nSo they don't work while going to school a lot of adult\nThen since more people have college degrees you having a degree doesn't buy you a job anymore\nBut I remember when I was growing up if you didn't have a high school diploma here we're screwed but if you are in a college degree you would stand out now you really don't stand out a lot of people have degrees you degrees online everybody on the mother's seems to have a degree right now so that's the case\nYou're not going to hit a job right away and let the thing you do get a job it may not be the fanciest job but now it costs a hell of a lot more to live your phone service your wife\nBy your rent your transportation\nYou know I mean I Would dump brides or take the bus you know people used the hitchhike now no I you know everybody's got a required to have their own car paper over or ... ... calls for\nNow the congressional budget office projects\nWhat we're paying in terms of student loans to rise apparently they project that the total amount of new federal student loans they will issue this year is going to be nearly one point five trillion dollars\nBy the year two thousand twenty five two point five trillion for student loan debt\nI spoke with ... he's been on the show is candidate for university reject southern Nevada and Andrew Cope said one way that colleges could help students keep their debt under control is by locking in tuition rates that means that tuition would not be increased walk to pursue their degree\nBy locking intuition students will no he says exactly how much they will pay each year in college which will help the budget corny that's Andrew Coats again a Kennedy university region [noise] um yeah that that happened\nThe middle of college and going through your degree price it's like\nIt's ridiculous but then you have to borrow more\nSo how students curb their debt OK guys that you've got to choose an affordable college\nNow according to us new data they say the average cost of tuition and fees for the two thousand Eighteen two thousand Nineteen school year one thirty five thousand six hundred Seventy six dollars at private colleges now that's not a clue what it costs to go to Harvard\nBut thirty five thousand almost thirty six thousand a year\nTo go to a private school why why do you have to go to a private school\nState resident the public colleges in Ninety seven hundred\nNinety seven hundred a year still a lot of money but at least it's a little bit more doable Twenty one thousand six hundred for out of state tuition fantasy students go to a state school filled a lot of universities like see these numbers\nSo maybe you want to get credits early at a community college and then finish my degree at the university a lot of people don't care if you took your English and your map and your basic requirement that community college it's great you can even get your degree a community college\nNow I live in the west so I don't think there's as much emphasis of you having gone to Harvard or Yale or Princeton or that that may be difficult for maybe back east yeah where'd you go to college gets the job I but I live in the west\nOr a little bit more ... well it's all\nGood me I wanted to you and I'll be a University School and I have tons of money especially because they offered you know scholarships if you were in Nevada a student who got good grades\nThey made it very affordable and then I went to medical school in state again saved money so if you don't really have to do for your degree\nV. at a fancy private college Jones I Know you want to go out of state and you want to get away from mom and dad than go to one in the school in another city\nThen a lot of you guys are not researching loan Scranton scholarship a lot of people think well I'm not going to get anything 'cause I'm a white male well there are still scholarship for white males true there's demographics that'll get scholarships\nBut was it was interesting there's the Pell Grant and Mark Kantrowitz publisher vice president for say for college dot com says two million students did not get a federal Pell Grants\nBecause they didn't follow their FAFSA fast as the free application for federal student aid they didn't think there were eligible so they didn't apply for the Pell Grant that's money right there scholarships are the best 'cause they don't pay the bat\nSo go to scholarships dot com look at some scholarships out there too but you could apply for but there's money out there people are always putting money into scholarships and kids with\nCetera so budget\nKids now these days after budget if they're used to mom and dad paid for their cell phones paid for their dad a plan if they shop on line if they're used to eating out nightly then they get a big culture shock when they live on their own\nSo you need to budget expenses early stick to it your sense of what the credit card trap these credit cards that you get unfortunately have a real high rate sometimes up to twenty five percent interest rate so only book borrow longer credit card what'd you can pay for each month\n[noise] if not just you're going to be in debt even more [noise]\nTry to

S. that had the highest level of certain symptoms and they reported it\nAnd strangely enough some of the states like one stayed had more people in that state uh inquiring\nAbout sweaty palms and other state might have more stomach aches or irritable bowel syndrome or nasal congestion or sleeplessness it was all over the board and I couldn't quite\nI still don't understand why it is that more people in a huge state the entire state we're Googling\nA these types of symptoms are anyway check it out for yourself ladies and gentlemen and see if the state your and you can figure out\nWhy and maybe how and the numbers of people who are Googling symptoms you may have some of these very symptoms and live in that state don't know but it's all there\nAnd the commentaries there and I would be honored if you would become a Facebook friend of mine in that way through the week I can send you out these fascinating and interesting articles including my commentary on them\nThe second posts just last week which got thousands and thousands of people looking at it and oh boy well I don't know Darren did you have a chance to see some of the uh comments about\nHow do you vote caffeine and sugar or barley and hops dude [laughter] oh man you know I didn't mean for that to get political\nIt was more of a my pointing out\nIn ... really what set me into motion on this of course it up now I'm referring to Dr lazy Ford and a doctor how our our judge Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh who's now a Supreme Court justice\nI put that up there because when a doctor Ford was testifying in front of Congress I noticed that she brought to the table and set right in front of her\nFor millions of people to view did you catch this a can of Coca Cola a can of ... uh you know colored sugar water with caffeine in it and I know that that's a no no in the in the in the chamber there they're not supposed to do that because\nIt when it gets on television that could be worth a lot of money it's his commercializing something that ought not being commercialized and there it was she brought the can of coke and she drank the coke and then of course a judge Brett Kavanaugh what on and on about how he enjoyed beer\nHe drank beer you will drink beer\nIs beer all that you know and so we asked the question\nHow do you vote before the vote of course and now the vote is done but we asked audio vote caffeine and sugar or barley and hops and boy did that set off a firestorm of reactions in ... ... people were tearing into each other because I didn't mean for it to go that way but it did but\nYou can check all that out and become a face\nBut fringe yourself and see some of these things is all there Dr Bob dot com spell out words Dr ...

drinks they're back in the news these artificial sweeteners\nNow believed to increase your risk of diabetes\nJust the opposite of what you would have thought many people believe they're dodging diabetes and obesity and other health problems by using artificial sweeteners and diet drinks big research out of Adelaide medical school in Australia discovering these drinks are bad news to the bone and in this case\nBad news to your banker is\nAnd yet you see people they are they going to the grocery store and who are the people who have all these diet drinks Diet Coke diet Pepsi and their cards

also have a health poll question we'd love to get your opinion of this week and I've seen this with my own eyes\nDo you favor allowing therapy dogs in hospital rooms you know bring him in there to cheer people up yes or no\nYou believe that these therapy dogs are important to bring them into a hospital rooms to cheer people up yesterday's vote on that in my Web site at Dr Bob dot com\nAs deals CPR Bob dot com if you're there on the site check it out if you are or not yet a friend on Facebook I Would be honored to have you because we are going to send you all kinds of stuff during the week that you'll like articles that we just can't squeeze into the show because we don't have enough time\nAll right we're going to turn our attention to another topic here we are fast approaching\nIt already in it in many instances the season where people\nMore often than not get ill we're talking about the common cold or talking about the flu we're talking about the justice issues big time\nWith all the holiday seasons right around the corner you need to know about how to protect yourself you need to know how to recover you need to know what you need to do on your side of the equation to avoid a lot of the bullets sickness bullets that are going to be coming your way both internally and external factors that can impact\nYour immune system both positive and negative and we've recruited a special guest to talk about that her name is Marty when it can\nShe's a board certified clinical nutritionist and author of the best selling book\nNatural alternatives to next to him and other acid blockers her new book entitled the pro by Arctic cure both of those you should have part of your health library by the way I Do\nMarty is the host of a long running syndicated radio talk show at our website healthy by nature show dot com and are free newsletter are great health resources\nMarty joins us today to discuss what I said how to help yourself out internally and externally with factors affecting your immune system with that let us welcome back to the show a Marty weight again and good day to you Marty\nWell a good day to you Dr Bob a great pleasure to be with you\nFor joining us let's jump right into this topic I mean we are like people are now getting hammered\nBy the uh call to action for getting the flu shot based on the fact that\nIt was a complete bust last year and in years past\nAnd they're being told that if they don't get the flu shot they're going to die if they don't do something they're going to die and uh so I Want to help people to better understand how to better take care of themselves let's begin there our topic today is the immune system immune health so how do people protect them\nHumans system immune health so how do people project themselves and their families this fall and winter season Marty\nWell we had a\nDebate till the cows come home about how good the vaccines are whether or not they have risk so that we don't want to tolerate but there should not be any argument about the things that we can do to\nImprove their chances I mean a lot of people who don't have the flu vaccine are suppose the flu and don't get it why is that they have a stronger immune system so I I get frustrated that we don't see\nAnd the publicity about those things that we can do internally and externally sometimes you'll hear some advice that it brings true ah wash your hands a cough into your sleeve I'm no question can't hurt to do those things\nBut uh things to do with the with nutrition and I'm always\nJust and I'm sure you are to amaze and nobody seemed ... and the media or I'm diabetic director crafts and so on and don't don't say\nOh well you know the flu season polls colds and flu season is also the season when we don't get so much sun could there be a connection\nWith vitamin D as just one example\nExactly exactly well that and people don't talk about the you know the relevance of\nThe host immune defense in other words those people who are most prone to get sick will get sick and the goal should be to help bolster or harden their immune systems so that when it does come their way they're going to be less likely to get it and to if they do get it there'll be more likely to\nBe able to get through it with ease and be better off as a result of it\n[noise] well exactly and the\nCurious thing again nobody seems to comment on that she can is that\nThey always say oh well the flu is the hardest on really young people really old people well coincidentally those are the same people who do not respond well to the vaccine\nBut could use a lot of help getting their immune systems to function better and um that's that's what we're here to talk about today\nRight do not respond well or did not respond at all and I are in the zone when they're taking the flu shots what they will get one hundred percent guaranteed is a\nMajor dose of toxic mercury and aluminum in the in the vaccines themselves because all of them have it now Marty ... what is the number one natural therapy that you recommend for enhancing the immune system let's say internally\n[noise] well I'm ... and [laughter] vitamin\nD I already mentioned a\nSo just you're in the study is directly related to immune response and I'm a lot of controversy is whole nother show about what the proper blood levels are and\nHow much you have to take to meet those levels and I know you've discussed it um but at another huge area that's not paid any attention to it as aren't good health because our immune system\nStarts\nA really early on and you said ... send me a article the other day about\nHow if you're taking acid blocking drugs the kinds of things I explain the dangers of in my book natural and hers next to him\nThat you are many times like three times more likely to come down with serious infections\nUm because stomach acid is supposed to be there to dissolve these critters and then if you go a little further in the in the rest of the digestive tract that's where I'm eighty percent of our immune function as and ... we're not paying attention and I know you're going to talk later about\nArtificial sweeteners and one of the effects of those and a lot of the chemicals were taken is to damage our gut bacteria and we're just cutting our our chances of fighting off as you say in a surviving these diseases\nSo what is your what is your recommendation somebody just passing through we just have a minute to break what is your best recommendation for to optimize the gut health or the micro biome\nWell I'd like to talk about supplements but the most important thing is to feed the ones you've got already well they don't like vegetables and fibers and not kill them off with drugs if you can avoid it [laughter] so\nWe can talk about how to supplement but start with the basics pay them well and we help them thrive\nYeah uses supply them with the raw materials they need to flourish so they can crowd out the bad guys and try to get in there or those that tried to assault them and we'll get into the specifics of that because people do want to know that they want to know if there are\nWays that they can because we you know most people live in a busy world and they can always eat correctly but they can certainly easily supplement their diets to offset which that what you're not getting and I want you to hone in on that\nAre both Doctorow hears and also a ranch active which I also want you to comment on\nAnd by the way when you do a search if you do a search on Amazon dot com for Doctorow here's it's spelled with two H is I get a lot of emails going I Can't find it in and what's the spelling it's old age H. I. R. A. apostrophe S. doctor oh heroes\nProbiotics no party can people take this is it important for people not just during the cold and flu season bronchitis season sinus sees and all that how about all year long it's just not a seasonal thing is it because people get sick all year long even though they get sick with these infections more commonly when they're not\nGetting sunlight and you're indoors more often\nThan we ever go through a month where there isn't something in the paper about a contaminated batch of this or that meet with Sam or spinach with like\nWe are suppose all the time and like I said this is good bacteria have optimum function of all of our systems and is only one of those so yes we should do it year round and\nLadies you double up when we're more exposure than like like right now and I'm really glad you brought a bridge active because\nOne or the other thing is is so hard I mentioned chemicals in relationship to artificial sweeteners and chemicals food but there are a lot of junk and that comes from agriculture on you talked about\nAround a in a pesticides and herbicides and a phone decides on these chemical we have to talk to find those because they are good bacteria and they sabotage ourselves and that's what the British active does\nYeah I Want to get into that a little bit more on the other side of his break Marty so why don't you stay right there will come back I Want to get a bigger discussion about Reggie active spelled R.

whole point when you happiness is challenged I have to do it even more so by the way uh we got about a hundred calls the living martyr was wrong it was not a pro tractor\nThat's right it's a compass you set compass you should go and punched the living martyr [laughter]\n\nSo I don't know if the living martyr goes to the punishment and we're not because an\nError an error it's such a tough call I hesitate to do it\nOh he doesn't like that's that's a big punishment [laughter] okay fine but I always punished\nAnyway thank you all for calling in and uh I have to say you know I'm a little crazed about accuracy I a\nTruce or to me is the\nTruth is what is it they used to say 'cause I mean this is next a godly man is true says ...\nCleanliness is a close third I [laughter] it's up there [laughter] 'cause if you tell the truth and you smell bad as I got to say my attraction to the truth is minimized I I Will admit it admitted incidentally\nYou know my view I I Am ... bad moods to a bad body odor\nAnd just like you take a shower to get rid of your body odor you have to take a shower as it were to get rid of your bad move\nThat's right that's my analogy\nShower and brush our teeth in large measure for others\nAs we should\nSo to wash away your bad mood if you can\nYou can a lot more than you think unless there's a you know there may well be a physiological source that that's a separate issue\nFor happiness our theme today is a biggie\nHarris my list my friends only have I I rooted up during the break\nThis my friends only have like a rooted up during the break health friend's children parents\nWork\nOh a marriage of course marriage so that was a six\nItems very few people have them all really good so you have to get\nHappiness where you can maybe one maybe if you don't have any of the others\nAnd you have friends that can compensate\nIf you don't have any of the others and you have marriage\n\nNow have to say this health is a health issue we Janeiro health is unique because if you don't have any if you don't have friends who don't have happiness from friends or children or parents were worker marriage and you have your health\nWell that's not enough\nHealth care else's health is more capable of ruining your happiness than it is of giving you happiness so it it's ... it but it has to be on the list because I'm living in reality\n\nFind happiness where you can okay that's the point instead of concentrating on where you don't have it\nAll right and every body on let's go to your calls one ape Prager\nSeven seven six\nAnd Julie in Chicago I've been waiting for ... for many years Hi Julie\nOffice that feeling is mutual so thank you thank you so much for taking my call on my question to you as I'm\nSure they're married and trying to improve the areas of your life that you don't that don't bring you happiness as opposed to accepting a status quo and and you sort of credit and looking for happiness\nWonderful question I my my my answer would be that but you do both you you uh you can't in other words you can't wait until that success\nFor you to be happy you can say oh when I fix this I'll be happy\nYou have to be happy wall fixing so I Want you to fix if you can\nIf one of those areas were two or three of those areas are or not sources of happiness I Would love you to pursue those areas but you can't for being happy until those are successfully accomplished\nSo that makes sense\nThat's really it's a very good answer I think it [laughter]\nOh You're welcome thank you that's the best question answer good\n[noise] er I liked that\nOne if you do this is from triple ... want if you do if the other person in your life fails to realize this\nCan you be happy with someone who doesn't realize that she told me about a a a a love interest you're talking about a friend ...\nWell I Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say your other spouse that business on board and in these matters that's Roy said then you still have the hopefully\nHealth friend's children parents or work I'm remember or not and or to be sources of happiness\nThis is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important\nThis is\nAnd you can't that's why Julie's question was so important you can't pay this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I moved to ah to Baltimore oh well it was a bad choice I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding they'll be offended by when I get married and I have children when my children got to get married\nWhen I Lived right right that's good when I lose this weight that's right yes there's always a wet and I'll be happy when you can't do I'll be happy when\n[laughter]\nThat that's the boys that all this time until when that happens is wasted\n\nOn ... and you don't know how much time you'll get anyway you know people die

been adopting that they don't have to I have a an IT department or anything like that since everything on them is Web based and you're right it to make a chrome book useful you have to have an

hundred journalists and analysts and more than one hundred twenty countries I'm Susanna Palmer this is Bloomberg [noise]\nCitizen Bloomberg Businessweek ... Hi I'm Jason Kelly and I'm Carol\nMaster welcome to the weekend edition of Bloomberg Businessweek over the next couple of hours we're going to bring you use a week in science and the magazine and so much more it's a special week though Carol 'cause we've got\nTo block buster stories that really anchor the magazine this week we've got one on the big hack this is exclusive investigative reporting about the Chinese government infiltrating some of the world's\nBiggest company we also have a Business Week exclusive on a quiet army at sixteen thousand Jason it isn't a subversive psi phi movie if the state of our current day politics in the United states but first we got to get back to that cover a story the big ...\nRight liver business because uncovered the most significant known supply chain attack ever against U.S companies and Jason we're talking about apple we're talking about Amazon dot com here's Jordan Robertson\nAnd twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen a unit a specialized unit of China's People's Liberation army uh implanted malicious microchips in server mother boards and found for U.S companies that one of the militias microchip do think about it as a permanent infection\nIn the hardware of a computer this is kind of the ultimate hack the ideal hack\nBecause every time those servers and food up the hardware the malware overloaded in this malicious chip\nAnd checks itself into the operating system and insects that computer every time it turns on it's the ultimate attack and it was found inside computers used by Amazon and apple as well dozens of other companies and so once\nThey're in a computer like that what can happen that when we first started reporting this story first have\nActually came during the Obama administration's of both the Obama and the Trump Administration are have been deeply concerned about this issue of supply chain security\nYou know what happens is once you get inside of computer we initially thought this must be about festive consumer data apple was hit the Syrian division was says this must be about China wanting to steal\nA searing user data were quickly corrected by several sources I said that's not what this is about it all the reason China when you go through the trouble the expense the cost of the time all the engineering these mother boards in this way is for a long term access to sense as networks it's about the corporate intellectual property\nTheft and military secrets and long term styles access to sensitive and our\nChildren one thing that struck me and your reporting these guys say it's a scale and ambition and these laws that makes it unlike any other Chinese hacking or infiltration that have gone on\nYeah this is a super complicated attack I've covered cyber security for over a decade as has you know my colleague Mike Riley who co authored a report we've never seen anything like this this really is as one source called at the cutting edge of the cutting edge to manipulate\nPi has elements in it that reflect the what the us and other economies are today so it included you know\nThe stiffer protections for intellectual property um there there are things about data that now are to be should be included in ... in trade agreements so it reflected kind of more ... how the evolution of of of economies and industries uh has has come\nTo that and we should remind people the TPP the Trans Pacific partnership it was one of the first things that the Trump Administration did was essentially pull out of the earth's full day in office\nI was his first act so that was that was seen largely also as a counterweight to China has power you know in a economic power so yeah I Know it's I mean and the research that has spent a lot of time trying to put that together so so yeah so this New Mexico agreement\nDoes incorporate parts of that a notably a with Canada and the and the dairy trade that was a matter of contention and then after negotiations and so uh now American farmers will have some expanded access to the Canadian market um but in other hum regards\nIt does not make very radical changes and in some it could it does make some changes that could disadvantage American companies because well it's going to make the auto trade it's going to add new layers of regulations to the Arctic shade of through\nContent uh requirements so now\nThey have a rule they have forty percent of the parts in a car\nHave to come from North American factories where workers are making an average of sixteen dollars an hour\nUm that is going to be a difficult to implement I Would say at the beginning yeah uh but it's also it's it's kind of unprecedented really for one country to try to legislate wages in another country and in Mexico you know the typical worker makes less than half\nOf that wow speak different hum so I mean the theory is that okay\nJobs and you know plans on jobs will flow back to the U.S or or to Canada also you know from this but it could not in that may not happen instead I'm auto makers may decide to situate their plants outside of North American tire and that's what\nThat's a key that it costs to escalate for manufacturers they're going to go to the low cost manufacturing area of the world I mean that's what we see and that's the trend that we've been seeing over the last few decades\nRight I mean with South America already has in Brazil an auto manufacturing powerhouse so I mean who knows I mean companies may find countries in you know near or that they they they could put plants and so that's a that's a big question\nSo clearly politically in the Trump Administration is framing this as a massive when making good on the campaign promise\nEconomically how would you characterize it for the U.S economy\nI think that they gain something more modest I think overall American\nBusiness is relieved to have an agreement right even if it's not the one that was initially build you know as what Trump won it with investors right at the beginning of the week that was my rally yeah there are a lot of relief um\nYou know people forget so us cut a deal with Mexico and then was waiting you know is how in Canada that you have a deadline of Sunday to come in and joined the deal\nYou know that's hugely important I think Americans forget Canada is like the biggest trading partner at the U.S has a bigger than traditionally an ally that um so you know they squeaked and I'm like right like hours before the deadline and\nSo I so that was a big sigh of relief okay we have an architecture still that looks\nPretty much like the old steel and that makes people comfortable I think about campaign promises right and if President Trump Donald Trump ... candidate you know talked about re doing these trade deals um and so here maybe some would say he's got to win but it's the backdrop of that was to kind of revive communities and bring back jobs a lot of folks say\nThese trade agreements aren't going to bring back those communities in the United states it used to have manufacturing operations but don't any more like it's not going to change\nNecessarily those communities or bring back those jobs that were lost\nThat's for an unlikely because as automakers wanted a to take advantage of Mexico's low wages even without like you know what I said okay we don't care if it's forty percent content we're going to start exporting cars to us and like eat the tariffs they may still save money life\nThat's one that's one issue also you know tape payments um don't bestow benefits on everybody and one of the things that happened when when Trump was very kind of aggressive and his rhetoric about ripping off NAFTA is that\nFarmers in the U.S ... said whoa what are you doing [laughter] you know this as hasn't been a very powerful engine for export for us agriculture exports to Mexico\nAnd you know and you're going to just you know throwing the trash so so he did you know so yeah he was trying to spark a revolution but like then he got blowback from another part of the American you know atmosphere can economy from you know from another\nBlowback from another part of the American you know an American economy from you know from another um ... I mean farmers and farmers have traditionally been part of his base right eye so this you know so I think\nA sort of a political realities are reflected in and some of that in the agreement at that it's not as bad scope and he's yet to end the and the backing of Richard Trumka um of F. L. C. I also you know Congress right\nAnd it still I mean it's important to note that this still has to get through ... and other stuff still to go in\nAnd it's going to go through Congress after them in terms of we do not want Congress to look\nVery good Christina thank you so much thanks you're lifting to Bloomberg Businessweek coming up ten Cadillac finally finally make a comeback\nJoined parents and experts and understood dot org or free online resource about learning and attention issues designed to help you help your child drive in school and in life understood that organized because understanding is everything raunchy by understood that Oregon the ad council\nAs a small business owner don't underestimate your own courage it took courage just to go into business and protecting it takes courage to like choosing an insurance broker with one hundred years of tailoring business insurance to customers needs and they won't underestimate your courage but instead will ensure it\nHas ...
