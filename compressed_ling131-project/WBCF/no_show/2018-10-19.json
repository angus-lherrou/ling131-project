about what can you just said he's he's the stuff but I Can't say on the radio [laughter] when you look at it now you said some issue but let's see here oh that's true well I'm going to going to say it he's wondering if we should be offended by\nFeminine [laughter] they should be people that [laughter] okay sure everybody use of yes Savage\nBut what I found really funny about this campaign was when I spoke to students on campus and said\nHere's what the progressive student union is proposing how do you feel about as\nMany students didn't even think these concerns were relevant I talked to a student who works in our university library at George Washington and she said that her manager was a former uh employee student employees who had worked his way out and she also said that she got the rains every single year and makes a high paying wage so\nIt made me wonder if these reforms were really not the dairies or if they're progressive student union was just trying to total liberal party line of of promoting this idea of socialist\nAddress or understand what they're saying you have a I'll go to work and I'll do a job if you treat for me there if you pay me wondering worry and if you promote people from only where are you so you can promote them even if there's a better candidate outside you have to know that person\nThat is correct that's what they are advocating for 'em and the list of demands also includes unionization of all human employees and variety of other radical I'm a campaign that they're promoting\nA hold your ears for a second because I think this is so bad\nOkay so I just I had to get better it's ever go ... go follow her at ... over on Twitter also go readers story she's a great reporter at a kid from the word\nBut actually when is old news professor so senators do deserve your civility really so so what does that mean go beat them up on my phone\nThat's what they found that as senator accuse me that's what the teacher is saying I'm and\nEssentially this professor university professor an onus tweeted that senator don't deserve your civility at restaurant um and that in addition to harassing them and heckling them and yelling at them you should get\nUp in their faces and stick your hand in their food and take their new away from that this is what the professor is advocating for and his sweet\nAnd in between uh actually is advocating for breaking the law that's what he's saying do is against the disease and not smart enough to know that\nYou know it's not that I don't think he's smart enough to know that I'm sure he does know that the question really into the care and clearly he he did not have a problem with harassment of elected officials who he disagrees with\nBy the way that's all we happening to Republican senators would he be okay with that if I did a to um to Dianne Feinstein would it be okay with you that the Cory Booker me busy\nI'm ... I'm sure it's just because people who disagrees with and you know I've had this conversation with college students on campus who are totally fine with the harassment a GOP senators vote that has been happening in recent weeks and I've asked them\nWhy isn't is okay why is this violent okay why this harassment okay and their response is\nThat the Republican Party is trying to take away uh American civil liberties and then when I asked them what they mean by that they never have a good response they say something about Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and when you follow up with any logic out all can you point out an example of how civil liberties are being taken away or how your rights are being taken away\nThey don't know what to say because the only train of logic they can you don't do as a liberal talking points at the media has been feeding them\nIt's a ... year a great journalist so I'm not going to even to pretend that I can give you a question to ask but if you run out of questions one day you're talking to one of these do versus maybe actually pose this question can you tell me what a civil liberty is and then shut up and let them answer you\nBecause they don't know they're just sitting on a key word here they have no clue and\nFor so many students you I speak to on a daily basis civil liberties are things like ah they consider abortion to beat her absolutely right and they don't even want to entertain the idea that there could be on a different perspective on that road that's a big concern on college campuses right now especially in the wake of the cabinet confirmation\nWell here's a great follow up to that ask them to show you abortion in the constitution and kill him to your weight or if they show me where it is in the constitution [laughter] um I'm happy to see it\nOh I I Would be happy about that but the problem is many of them don't care about the constitution porridge\nWhy are they talking about civil liberties you believe in God but they're connected today [laughter]\nYou know I Know because the media doesn't connect it for them and that's all they hear and that's all they repeat\nIt's a ... on Twitter she is I ever get marine great correspond ... or less loan you made a a University of Maine bars that professor who set up the entire cabinet D.C trip ... this was a big story for about a half a second to the media ran away from it this is obviously a liberal professor who was what loading the buses\nRight so this professor offered a free credit to students who died on Boston would go talk to senator Collins out her D.C office and unfortunately the leadership Institute campus reform reports on the story\nAll the time when professor use their authority to promote their personal political pause and even just students extra credit or in this he\nOffered credit to students but luckily the university caught wind up thanks are reporting and they\nThey stopped it right in its tracks and they said this is not allowed to happen and they are the professor from ever teaching again\nAnd I believe that private universities and colleges have have more leeway in more rights than than a taxpayer subsidize university this is a University in Maine that is paid for by every taxpayer were professor of legitimately said I Will buy\nA will buy you some credits if you if you will do do my bidding down and Susan Collins face basically we're saying do my political bidding I don't care where we get funded I don't care what would that were that were subsidized by the tax\nDo my political bidding I don't care where we get funded I don't care what what were the subsidized by the taxpayers I Will allow you to have a free credit on the taxpayers dime if you go and do my political of persuading that's really what this person did\nTrack you can sign up for that trip and the professor for when\nI'm there were different selection that students are required to fill out like are you require are you able or willing to be arrested her pale why are you willing to\nTalk about your experience with sexual assault on a a live stream or a large groups doing very clear that he's professor wasn't just\nTrying to bring it crowds and senator and she was trying to cause and she wanted or what have been totally okay where you are asking or telling their stories and calling ...\nYou know I said the goal of trying to get back on them for\nA good I have gotten the credit had been a student there instead of going to go down and think calling for voting for them\nYou know I I doubt I'll come on the track or they don't even want to be surrounded by people who think you're a bad person reporting back I'm banged up their mind that you think\nYeah I I I'll I'll bet a Abigail we always appreciate the hard work from you

Fox News and the author of the new why we fight\nTo comment on a\nA gossipy anecdote that we had late this afternoon from Bloomberg News and others repeated it that there were strong words exchanged in the White House in at least earshot of journalists around the oval office between the national security adviser John Bolton\nA longtime friend of the show and John Kelly the chief of staff a and a former marine general strong words and the subject was the\nQuestion of the onslaught that's the president's words of migrants headed to the border you've seen the photographs or you've seen the video we have this report from the wall Street Journal late in the day\nAfter all of this anecdote about both ... and Kelly exchanging strong words\nPresident Trump is elevating the issue of immigration rights Alex leery of the journal which drove is twenty sixteen campaign with the aim of animating Republican voters in a midterm election that threatens to derail his agenda if Democrats we take the house\nMr Trump's latest comments came Thursday as he warned about an onslaught in quotes of migrants reaching the southern us border with Mexico and threatened to deploy the military did Mr Trump if the cats\nI think us border with Mexico and threatened to deploy the military did Mr Trump if the caravan isn't stopped set this is certainly national security and John Bolton is the national security adviser John Kelly was homeland security secretary before the president asked him to be chief of staff\nI can I can imagine the real story here is much more fun than just strong words but we'll leave it at that the demonstration on the border right now looks like a provocation\nThese people marching from well a hundred and sixty of them started out in Central America and they picked up\nA they picked up fellow travelers along the way it looks like a provocation and if I were to guess who this benefits it's some version of the Democratic party's idea of open borders the question I have for use that because you were on the campaign and sixteen is this\nA motivator for Republican votes in twenty eight teams because it certainly wasn't sixteen\nNot only is it that motivated John this was the platform on which the the man who won the election for the presidency build his whole campaign let let's you know wind the video tape back a little bit the first senator\nWho endorsed candidate Trump was none other than the current attorney general Jeff Sessions and at that event when he put on the red hat\nWhat was the what was the subject of rally\nThe wall illegal immigration that's where it all began people\nAlways gravitate to the the moment when he came down the escalator at Trump Tower but substantively when it comes to policy it is immigration reform and securing our borders which began the whole Trump effect of course this this comes at a\nVery good time for the Republican policy you know the videos that are now going viral on social media of a so called refugees all member caravan being paid off in cash\nYes I saw that that was puzzling but I wasn't sure what they were being handed but it certainly was it clear that they were eager to get whatever they were handing out\nRight so this this you know that this will be used by some Packwood superPAC as we get that they count down from what is it the ... we have left so\nAgain this is your absolutely correct a national security issue and it should be couch this option let's not forget also\nThe speech that the other presidential candidates have trade group ... bankers that was leaked to the press and anybody to listen to your show John can download the transcript which Hillary Clinton\nTold the audience my dream my objective is to have a\nBorder in this hemisphere meaning from Canada\nTo South America no national borders at that point you know as well as anybody else America as a concept cease to exist and this is a party platform issue that will be used by the joke ... and to the president's better for\nIt was a nice details on the wall to Wall Street journal\nSome vulnerable Democrats are using the issue as well Senator Joe Donnelly who's running for reelection in Indiana has run advertisements promoting his support for Mr Trump on immigration including building a border wall while taking a shot at quote radical left over calls to abolish ice so\nIf a vulnerable Democrat in Indiana is worried about this I can imagine the vulnerable Democrats in other red states are worried about this ... this is the Senate but that would also mean that vulnerable at a Republicans\nIn suburban districts the Democrats have targeted would cut can use this issue to bolster themselves\nI think it's incredibly effective irrespective of geography or who's robbing where I I used when I was in the White House is very simple analogy when a when you go to bed at my age do you love to go from though\nIf you do is it because you hate everybody outside\nThough because you wish to protect everything but you love inside your and America is a home and its border is Trump's door\nAnd the idea that we will not controlled who says oh is of course on these ethical counterintuitive to most Americans that also is a very simple constitutional matter of old a matter of fact that the individual who has that you meet rights to decide\nOn who comes into this country and by which y'all to

that when people are doing very well they have the leisure the complacency that to to look at a hot button social cultural issue and that's what the Democrats are counting on this can be\nA referendum on the cruelty of Donald Trump but I think you're seeing with Mexico but\nFor all of a bomb of a model if all of a ... an international is when people didn't have any respect for him and people are starting to sense that\nObama would have never gotten Mexico to even do anything on his own border but whatever they think of Trump\nPeople abroad tend to listen to him more than Obama map starting to get clear in these last two years and I think that helps trumpet he's considered\nA strong leader and people when when there is no alternative Jong when you see these people coming forward and they're saying I'm going to be in the United states and six or seven days and you can't stop me and if we can stop them and we don't have a country anymore so most people are saying to themselves\nWell I

the question rephrase it does the in party lose control of the house rather than just lose a lot of seats\n'em and change the the the the political nature of the house then that's not as common it's only three or four times so I think they can lose twenty seats and that would be historically in line with what usually happens but not necessarily lose the house because things\nAre changing and usually when you see an abrupt change it doesn't rode it gets more intensive and I think the Kavanaugh and the aftermath of the Kavanaugh and ... lives with war on and the caravan they all have a

Hezbollah and Brazil Malcolm you asked a question it's yours\nYes first food good to talk to chose to begin a what do you think about the arrest of a sudden Barakat who is a key ... as well out financier and what do you think the likelihood that we can actually affect the way to extradition to the United states\n[noise] well that's actually the second question is actually really really important one let me get to that but I found them I ... that's a key get at the key get or um any any government really in the region and and I'll see if we can actually get in the United states to be very important as well I think honestly the most important for Argentina\nBecause the ... in in South America is an old Lebanese\nClan that's tied to Hezbollah that's in finance and not just to elicit narcotics and things like that but the bulk and finally the tears operation including the army attack in Nineteen Ninety four which is white and I think government should talk to them first um so what are the chance that they're going to extradite him to the United states\nIs that a U.S person but we'd have to charge him with something here in the United states I mean if it's money laundering or something but I'm pretty sure there's there's something that we can charge him with\nBut I think that you're not going to be anything like that happened after the election in Brazil ah because I think we're going to see how the political makeup is in Brazil and then the if there's a time the opportunity to do could do so uh so I'm not sure that's going to happen but I think\nThis is a great kind of a symptom of the success that we've been having a more recently because I think you know the ...\nOf a mystery to complete it it'd be much stronger on that even though it's not very vocal about it they'd been very strong about looking at the tear finance networks all throughout the world and particularly in South America or they they they looked at has very strongly in and try to work the regional governments to go after him\nLet's say in Brazil I'm reading the economist about Brazil there's an exciting election there in which a man who's described as a far right populist\nWho managed to I was stabbed in the ... the stomach during a rally is now leading all contenders are he seems to be from the column of none of the above I don't know how to say his name correctly in Portuguese

that an establishment wing that's been a wave throughout the world\nA tremendous help he comes from that an establishment wing that's been a wave throughout the world that obviously kind of a similar ah seeing that in the United states would be elected a President Trump he would that non establishment candidate he has a bit of a military background but not much of a political background\nHe was at X factor nobody really expected him to do much in the presidential race at the beginning of the of the election season but now he became the front runner\nAny any looking like he may may win on October twenty fifth when they when they go to the polls it'll be a close election and the first round which was more candidates now it's just and and a guy named Daniel ... and so I I Do expect him to win I think he went and if he does\nHe's very close to two religious communities including the image eloquent Jewish community he's close to the military is close to other element they think they

categories that they still struggling Latin America understands terrorism particularly Islamic terrorism but they understand transnational criminal organized crime because they deal with every day

led by a bedroom prosecutor name ...\nI think that they should focus a lot of cases that currently exists that are already on the docket of Hezbollah members whether involved in trafficking money

Botox\nWe will talk in this part of the program about the American role in the world and that its course has been the subject of controversy from the ball but this country was founded and it has increased\nIn importance over the years as the size of the power of the United states has grown our responsibilities have grown and this old world of ours has shrunk because of\nThe jet aircraft in satellites and the Internet and the host of other factors we are a part of this planet and a major part of this planet whether we like it or not and so we're talking this evening\nWith Robert Kagan easily Freedman senior fellow with the project on international order and strategy\nAnd the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution a columnist for the Washington Post author of a number of uh books including his latest the jungle grows back it's published by come up sometime America and our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nBank around there\nThat's a quite a title the jungle grows back and what's the derivation of that\n[noise] well if you think about the fact that you know the world have been living in all it's a it's been pretty good uh but you know there are out there in the world are forces coming from China and Russia\nAre around ... or is that you know want to sort of destroy the oil in it and that's what I mean by the jungle growing back and we need to continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over the Gulf us ...\nAnd now of course there is a a view that has a at various times been the stronger or weaker but it's never disappeared in that view I guess can be summarized as or none of our business\nNone of our business let's just to stay out of the world to uh keep an arm's length ear will just to sit back on our own shores and make our country better and we won't\nIf you will just to sit back on our own shores and make our country better and we won't we will go meddling is somewhat but it\nSure and I mean it's very tempting because of course it's costly to get involved in the world but I think what we learn in a in the Nineteen thirties when we we tried to pursue exactly that policy we tried to stay out of the world is that ultimately the world comes back and bite sauce\nAnd then we have to fight a much bigger war and spent a lot more money and cost a lot more lives so we need to take the steps when it when it's still possible to do so at a reasonable cost and that means to be steadily involved\nNow another issue that often comes up an argument if you will look countering the one that you make in the book the jungle grows back is that\nAnd say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I still have a hard time believing that you're better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nThat would be yet another vicious dictator or that we can now at people who are now carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes as a country uh I certainly make mistakes\nOr think about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is\nA are we going to deal with the threats that are out there are way and uh unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nA one as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the government\nOf the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when the U.S forces finally reached a uh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have in many cases\nIs thinking that we can do things like this are on the cheap and the quick\nA particularly the second the Iraq War the notion being that that will go in will pull out the uh\nThe underpinnings of the uh Saddam regime and the entire country will rush to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time\nGoing down that road [noise]\nWell that's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nBen let us to do nothing in Syria where now we have Russian forces we have a rainy and forces and we have terrorists or says ah you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything and we shouldn't be everywhere\nBut there are places where we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nMight six six five oh Jim Boeheim when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who calls in from east Texas hello Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know it's like I'm I'm working on a piece us right now is a historian that the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world there was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that\nMapped the world and that brought marketing pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map where they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us\nTo the point that we are today and I feel that is inevitable and America seems to be the uh the chosen vehicles or the inevitable\nA position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individual is Dick notions against a you know I'm collective is notions and that's that's something that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nI I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question\nThat the caller's right to say that you know the United states found itself in a particular position or that do other country was in an idle some of it has to do with geography you know we've talked about being surrounded by two oceans\nSome of that has to do with geography you know we've talked about ... surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability\nTo send forces at maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there\nA that would eventually Gulf us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect\nAn international economy in a way that benefited our road so I think that's you know there is something special about America we shouldn't forget about it what are you know whether there is an arc of history I guess that means to me but uh certainly United States has been shaped history with that's with it since well yes\nAnd in and of course it is it this way if there is an arc of history we certainly aren't yet in a position to be able to\nUh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a available to be heard not only on our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means uh anywhere in the world and the skill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight pillow Gil\nHere's Jim I'm just want to comment on uh on on your guest's views on\n... like a Korea and Japan has um treaty ah arrangements with the United states and under certain conditions we could be a trip wire\nFor the U.S stretcher into a into another major conflict\nIs is there for Korea or Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize that are not that many years ago this was United States territory\nUntil Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many a potential major conflicts exist and that is to say no true just exactly how many countries out there are covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building a well artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters\nPoint taken All right let's not argue has commented about that that notion of a of the some of the\nA bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea and the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a large conflict and Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies we will deter\nA China from attacking them whereas if we are pulled back and and and those kinds of stuff that\nWe will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we get thrown in to conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain eats and not have to get into\nWar is if we think we could stay out of the conflict that\nInvolve China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered a twice over the last uh past century we can't stay out of those kinds of conflicts\nAnd if we try to do so uh uh if we tried other words to go for quote the peace and honor in our time we usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about or offshore balance SARS but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties and the consequences of that was found up a fight on shore so I think it's better to ... through the security arrangements\nStay with us or more to come by one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Robert Kagan our guest is the Freedman

Pennsylvania now good evening Carol\n... you say that it and you need to keep\nThat radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call [laughter]\n[noise]\nI don't want to say much all I wanted to say as I Am against the United states doing any first strikes\nWell okay I'm not sure that ah that we have any cost and plated or as a matter of uh of your thought process Robert Kagan a I guess we would have to define a further first strike a I doubt that were of a bind to go around and let's say when they first\nA strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of auction of option although my guess would be that there may be places and circumstances in which\nAt proactively engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion the beneficial\n[noise] yeah I mean we certainly I we I Can't imagine those using nuclear weapons in the first strike that's that's not been our policy in it and it it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a a crisis developing a that might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA in a in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that as we have in the past and uh and you know try to do with his intelligence is selectively as possible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's talking about\nThe big ended the key is in the term of first strike\nA more to come what eight six six five oh Jim bode what should be the American role in the world regardless of

to Lance in Galloway New Jersey on the boat Hannah Joe hello Lance\nAnd grieving can both be remiss through ... warrior I'm great thank you for going\nWhere um where you're right there is a ... you know the human species are definitely imperfect better more highly competitive but I see a comparison in the original ashtray tragedy of the common\nAnd at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources a vote they will come to conflict rather than a compassion\nAnd unfortunately a classic example of people that are still deep rooted in hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical\nSo I mean people just don't get along at certain points in harm's when they think something of of reserve a value for them or their their uh ethnicity is going to be pregnant away and jeopardize\nLet me offer a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever\nAnother goes back to some years ago when I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa\nAnd at the time I said well first of all I was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to cover the next war but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you want\nThen that's probably as good a place to go is any of the only place I could have put on a par with that I suppose was was somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course India and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while\nThat well of course India and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons that they in fact a later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you want to look at at those conflicts alone or South Africa\nWhich is still troubled today to be sure but there's been no all out war there a Northern Ireland which still has its problems but again the vicious gorilla fighting has gone away and I'm not sure ... Robert Kagan I Would buy the thesis that some conflicts can never be resolved\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think the conflicts can be contained and that's what we've done for instance in Europe you know when I when you talk about the middle east and how people evading show there forever and fighting each other forever\nOr you know in the Nineteen thirties that's exactly what people said about Europe and it was true you know Europe and Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries\nAnd people said well how can how can we expect to bring Europe to peace and yet and yet we were able to\nNow I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily do in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim that you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example a and say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other\nOr not like each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nYeah and then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test year ... things are made better I think that's a much more a plausible a litmus test for any course of action thank you for your call labs we go

Chrysler lower by twelve percent and Tesla is down fourteen percent that's all year to date so not a great investment in the automobile industry it'd be ...\nSo they have enough ... understand perhaps why the latest news out of the time it really doesn't change things all that much\nThanks very much Dave Wilson Bloomberg stocks comments Sunday even email at the Wilson and Bloomberg dot net sign up for his daily free email newsletter and you'll get his chart of the day it is time to go to our Ninety nine one studios in Washington DC where ... has world and national headlines Nathan him think they may be ready to talk again president\nFor some time now that's not the whole picture they really had strength in there or they grew sales and their grooming division their health care division their fabric division so I'm a broad based a series of categories fueling this day in this quarter\nSo this has to do also with organic sales growth correct\nIt does so organic sales growth that what they mean with that number is sort of excluding an activity and currency fluctuations and so that's a closely watched\nMetric for this particular company given its global reach but if you're talking about organics that is definitely an area that they're focused on and natural I'm understanding that the consumer is kind of\nMoving in this direction and considering that more of a priority to for example in the diapers division they now have this at Pampers natural lines it's supposed to be made in a more sustainable way and that helped drive growth and a quarter\nI Love this sort of organic gross versus organics and then have to wonder what is organic face cream I mean how is that again I just by looking at my I Do want to ask you though as Sarah and they also said that they were gaining market share and a number of different divisions who's the loser here who are they grabbing market share from\nYeah it it's not ... I think it varies widely across the globe so for example I think one interesting place to look at it in their love his diaper division not the place where they had been getting smacked by the private label diapers makers because they had that still under price so you can assume that's up from the likes of Omar from target from Amazon\nBut strong private label offerings there they slash prices in the wild division I this quarter to try to get some of that market share back and so presumably that sort of where that push and pull is taking place\nHave they been able to raise prices or is that still a challenge\nBut that's a really good question so they have and now they're going to be raising prices on some key brands like\nBounty sharman off because of commodity cos ray of hope cough paper costs are increasing and so they're going to be taking those price increases\nStarting October thirty first or we don't know yet how consumers are going to respond to that and I think that's a really important thing when you look at how sustainable if this growth that they delivered that's quarter that's a real X factor executives were cautioning on the conference call today\nThat are trying to take these price increases could result in some volatility because they don't know how much Kimberly Clark or Colgate Palmolive is going to move in the same direction and they could end up losing shoppers when they take that the action\nI'm just strange person that actually pays attention to the price of my toilet paper or my a paper towels do you ... you\nKnow to use their uh I pay attention to that and the differential can be dollar is like entire dollars in one package\nI don't I'm definitely a person who just on auto pilot ... much about myself [laughter]\nI Want to get your sense of how much Proctor and gamble is just doing things right itself and how much it's indicative of the strong consumer\nThat people have really been rejecting so far this year in Proctor Gamble shares are still down nearly two percent year to date so you are is a consumer lot stronger than people think and does this give wind to other consumer product companies\nI think this is an indicator of ah the fact that the consumer environment is strong and we see this and so many different ways like that isn't strong quarters for a major retailers are in in cute too and I think that there's an additional reflection of that said I Do think that\nThe consumers and strong for a while now right so the fact that PIN gee is seen as inflection point does speak to some of the things they're doing right I think particularly and groaning category that is that the way they were just assaulted by these newcomers like dollar shave club and Harry's\nThere were offering need sort of disruptive subscription models and they finally return to growth there this quarter and so that suggests that you know they ... on the one hand it's smart things in terms of adjusting their price structure to be more competitive with those guys\nUm and also just got their mix of products in the right places in front of the right shoppers\nI got to imagine though that whatever happens in China is also important to Proctor and gamble they sided double digit growth in some of their skin Caroline's in China\nAnd China isn't very very important to their future right now it's actually only nine percent of their total annual sales but certainly that that will change over time as the middle class grows there but China is definitely a real success story for ... there's only two years ago that they were posting declining sales in that market overall and they've just been doing a lot\nThe only two years ago that they were I think it climbing failed in that market overall how they're doing a lot of consumer product or one on one type work\nThere I think the labor and did a great example of that so and China they really wanted to make that brand stronger so they changed the packaging there oh lay the product on at the place where ah in the Chinese market you might have actual like over the counter service\nRepresentative there so they changed the training and the approach to that terrible it's

pressure to act against Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of Jamal ... speaking to reporters yesterday secretary of state Mike Pompeo disgust us Saudi ties\nThere and important strategic\nAlliance of the United states that we need to be mindful of that as well\nSo now you have a situation where the administration wants to have a relationship with the Saudis this despite increasing pressure from Republicans in the Senate bill ferries Bloomberg News national security team leader here to help us break it all down what's the state of play right now with President Trump and king NBS\nWell it's interesting because what we've seen from President Trump and secretary palm patio and others is that they still don't want any kind of a rush to judgment here against the Saudis\nBut how do they not had that when there's so much evidence that has come out essentially that this is true that the Saudis were responsible for that\nWell there there pushback is we need to see the results of this investigation which puts a lot of pressure on Saudi Arabia and to a lesser extent turkey to make sure there was a real credible investigation here most people think if you have something that's credible it's going to be very hard to separate the\nCrown prince of Saudi Arabia from what happened but uh there are reports now the New York times saying that the Saudis have identified and intelligence official who might be a basically and as a fall guy in this case are saying that he operated perhaps a misunderstanding his orders or outside the authority he was given\nA one eyed one lawmaker is saying that they're waiting for Saudi Arabia's investigation of itself and of course they're going to come up with some sort of cover a story that's what the lawmakers said he is it possible that they will have to dismiss the Saudi account\nThat's you know that's the pressure that's really on the Saudis now in this case has to come up with something that uh the Washington in particular but much of the world can at least a ... that has some plausibility to it\nUm and that would likely you know a show that in fact the crown prince of Saudi Arabia as a as a human being who may have gone too far may have made a mistake or May of or or or has people who are operating a without his knowledge either way it's not a very good look\nFor someone who is really steak themselves as a new type of leader I think this whole episode is pending the crown prince says more of an authoritarian in line with a lot of other a strong a strong leaders from the middle east of who you know I have basically been seen as authoritarians or dictators\nAnd you're also starting to see the fallout here inside the beltway especially\nIn the lobbying community the Washington Post distancing itself from the PG are column is a lot of prominent lobbying firms here inside of Washington the lobbying force that can be asking the Saudis have had in the president's in Washington DC bill you know better than anybody\nHas been so so influential I Do want to switch gears now uh because the Saudis started quickly evolving but there's other major frogs in terms of the geo political\nLandscape secretary of state Mike Pompeo a in Mexico meeting with Mexican officials as this caravan crisis of sorts four thousand migrants coming up from Central America\nWhat does this mean first and foremost on the policy side bill for the challenges that it faces with the a policy landscape but also in terms of the ... the mid term elections\nWell a secretary Pompeo speaking in Mexico city today describe the ah the the situation on the U.S border as a crisis at this point he wants to Mexico to act\nBut he would really like to see them acting on their southern border with Guatemala stopping this caravan if it gets there not letting people through so that it becomes an issue um but the the flip side of this is this is also the migration issue is something that really can drive\nA the president's base that can help what the turnout just ah I think two and a half weeks from now\nSo uh it doesn't hurt them politically to raise this issue or\nHalf weeks from now so uh it doesn't hurt them politically to raise this issue but they clearly wants to see Mexico doing more to stop this from becoming an issue that makes its way all the way to the U.S southern border\nWe've heard varying warnings from President Trump or that the new trade agreements could be threatened to Mexico doesn't do something to stop the migrants are maybe he'll use the military to close the borders could could he really close the borders\nWe've seen you know we've seen him him resort to a caller on the military in the past uh the the National Guard who have been helping out or not actually doing border patrol in or anything like that\nUm I think it's a I think it's a hard sell at this point uh and Mexico is now saying it may seek some un help to to address this uh this kind of Caribbean crisis that we keep seeing crop up\nI Want to jump around the world against this bill is literally been doing all this and like Fifteen seconds or less ... tell us about this new story on the terminal to us to spend another military exercises in an aide said North Korea talks\nRight the Pentagon said today that uh the u._s. is suspending a military drills that was set to begin with South Korea involving hundreds of aircraft it's a sign of the Trump administration's patience I think with the ongoing negotiations with North Korea they want to give it a little more time\nAround the world with Bill ferries Bloomberg News national security team leader thanks for coming out of the politics policy power in law the Trump Administration and the Supreme Court more on that later but first ... for a check on the vets\nThanks Kevin as we mentioned there is no lit up and the pressure from Capitol Hill or executive action against the leaders of Saudi Arabia over the disappearance and suspected killing of a dissident Saudi journalist democratic Senator Jeff Merkley says the administration should stop making excuses over the case of ...\nThe government is asking for a rate of ... to stop the trial which is rare explain what that is and what the government would have to show the Supreme Court to get it\nWell ... to mend Amos really mean that it's a ... to stop some kind of action and they really want to stop the court from taking actions and that's why it's so hard because uh you you very rarely get or with that stops a cord from going forward\nTo do what it's been asked to do\nAnd so I think it is very difficult to get that and they ... and as you indicated they've already been turned down by several courts not just the Supreme Court but the Ninth Circuit court of appeals and obviously the district court\nAnd so I don't think they're going to succeed in that I think the case will go forward and the plaintiffs\nIn this case a papal ages about ten to Twenty one will or have an opportunity to try and prove their case\nThe plaintiffs in this case want the government to put in place a plan to phase\nOut carbon emissions and stabilize the earth's climate and um even if the courts according to the government would recognize the legal right to a better environment which is a stretch only Congress has the authority to impose the the kind of rules you would need to do that\nSo is it unlikely that even if the plane gets windy here that it's going to be a pound\nIt probably is unlikely June I mean although\nThere are laws on the books now that the conceivably that administration if they wanted to could tighten things up a lot obviously as the last administration sought to do in this administration has sought to undo but I I think the biggest turtle\nFor the plane is in this case is that that can you try and force\nThe government to take action based on\nViolations of constitutional rights that don't necessarily fall into the statutes that are on the books to deal with some of these problems that I think that's going to be the biggest turtle that the plane if they're gonna have to overcome\nAre you surprised that the case has gotten this far has gotten to the trial stage\nYou know somewhat somewhat surprised a because there's some other cases that have been thrown out when they when they basically have tried this site you know negligence and other kinds of\nLaws that might allow people to do some of this stuff because the courses that look or their laws on the books and they have to work within those laws and this is really a constitutional challenge and they're you know they're really saying here that the\n... their constitutional right to life liberty and property are being violated and that's it you know that's a very broad and amorphous concept and I think it's\nNothing like this has ever been held before and so I'm a little surprised that it's gotten as far as it has and and they're going to have a chance it looks like two or at least put their case forward it to the district court in who seem sympathetic to this by the way the judge\nWhat kind of evidence is likely to come out of that trial who who are they all kind of what it says are they calling or are they going to find out you know things have been hidden for years or is\nOh I I don't think so June I think what they're going to do here they're basically saying look over the government is promoting fossil fuel consumption you know leave\nSo they're basically saying well the government\nPromoted fossil fuel consumption you know leaf plants or mineral developments and you know preventing oil and gas wells to do all kinds of stuff without proper controls\nAnd there is evidence out there right now about that and they they they may come out you know may come up with stuff that hadn't necessarily been made public but I think there are ... and and I think because they can\nShow that you look you know that the government over the years has done this stuff I mean with all the\nMineral leasing and and some of the racial stuff where they're trying to loosen up the control you know and methane and some other things like that that increase greenhouse gases into the atmosphere of will obviously they use to try to prove their case\nOnly about a minute here checked I Do want to ask you about the EPA have you seen any changes since Scott Pruitt departed from the EPA\nWell I think that they're trying to be a little quieter and how they go about doing\nThings so and then and they haven't done it exactly the way he did it they're trying to\nProceed little more slowly but I think in general are still on the same path to try and do stuff but they're not trying to sort of delay regulations in the same wherever they are trying to replace things like the clean Power Plan and stuff like that so I think they're I think the overall the thing is still the same\nBut I think they're trying to do it in a more orderly way\nAll right thanks so

their next may global macro strategist at Bloomberg News to already put out a net this Friday I Am one Seventeen Wall Street time than I have a good weekend everybody\nBut he also has now said the treasury market she'd braced for three and a half percent ten year Yale Field in twenty ninth team after that higher tired but you know the un I won't go into the technical too much it's a rich you know what you'll lose Jason ... he'll be like they do are I think you know but but on the fundamental\nBasis or a an old friend with some real proper sourcing to Washington\nOr as noting that uh what markets are expecting is that Nancy or the Democrats will when the house closely at this point to become the next speaker once again laugh and the estimation of the markets is that we'll have this stalemate in in Washington right\nDemocrats won't budge Trump won't budge things will move along generally speaking good thing for the stock market last friday life they love gridlock but what the sources are telling me is that I'm close people will actually engaged Trump\nAnd they will work together on building infrastructure spending in the United states\nMaybe second push for fiscal spending\nThe Democrats are going to need something to ... going into the twenty twenty election they need to keep the economy moving forward or trampled and say see you voted Democrats into the house there weren't the economy and let's not forget Democrats and Republicans had both been behind infrastructure spending ... being as a real pet project for for Chuck Schumer is well I'm\nSure you'll get the Senate ... support with McConnell and Schumer working together\nThe big surprises in twenty Nineteen will actually get Republicans or Democrats working together but what that means is a big push in fiscal spending\nMost likely much higher rates on a bigger deficit and what the technical suggest without going deep into it is a push somewhere between three forty five three fifty five in the tenure\nThank you for not pushing dip into the [laughter]\nYou know I think for the people I I I enjoy your crime here I'm trying to watch out\nFor you I Know I appreciate it very much free ... a woman's plane technical you well you're really doing that's out of in light of self interest because then later I'd be like what were they talking to explaining to woman's lane that to me\nWith trust me these technicals of their own standard deviations you don't\nWant to hear about things like that\nAnd I say that what you just said is only one you know that whole thing I I Do worry about these expectations of what polls tell us going into another round of elections kick ass we saw how wrongly where well last time around\nBut the thing is even if the Republicans keep the house that even more of a certainty that will get more no okay\nAnd we will get Russia spending because that's the president I planted point yeah because they want to say they they do want to make those personal tax cuts permanent they're not at the moment so they need to get that done\nThey may or something else so that to point to appease the Democrats say were railing against it saying it was tax cuts for the rich\nI won't win on that but the you know there are arguments ... for both sides of that um and then so if the Republicans do hold the house then almost certain without question we get the infrastructure push which which Schumer will support well\nThink about what that ... to the equity markets right wouldn't that be kind of a little bit of a another kicked to the upside potentially well for certain groups with effort into benefit that means there's people working who are working on the infrastructure projects in the trickle down\nRight and as less than four percent unemployment so the issues that we have\nIn terms of jobs might only get worse if you get that sort of situation I'm struck though I put out a a commentary earlier on my social media feeds from Romesh putting world over Bloomberg opinion yes but basically says if the Republicans gained control of Congress keep control of Congress what's gonna happen not much\nThat's his views so you know it's not a given that you're going to get to these kinds of moves into next year well it is a give and is that we got a whole lot more money to get through and there is a real diversity of responses to lead set of results were seeing\nDo you brought that up more talking a lot more about that certainly as we get into that\nIt was ... he brought that up more talking a lot more about that certainly as we get into next week we'd Carole and I both have been emailing with our various investor friends\nLooking ahead to next week huge tech names coming out those especially\nAre benefiting once we definitely watch they will send stocks had her for Bloomberg you will be back with us with your chart and soccer today\nThan signal a global macro strategies that Bloomberg it contributes to the macro squawk desk as Hugh you a go on the Bloomberg you and he's wearing blue today and a white T shirt he's usually a black T shirt I so I said well friday below in my mind All right let's get some world and\nNational headlines so that we turned about moon and the eleven three hundreds or ... thank you Jason and Carol\n[noise]\nAnd it really speaks to the ... dam checked spoke gets on improving Honeywell sales growth which is traditionally not really been a strong point for the company but what's important is he's doing that while also continuing to increase margin\nSo we haven't sacrificed that strong operational execution story that investors really love it Honeywell but at the same time he's pushing revenue growth forward and I think what's important is that a number of Honeywell businesses are longer cycle like aerospace automation\nPetrochemical so those are position as sort of see that\nMomentum continue versus some of the shorter psycho names that we saw a report earlier this week and last week like fast and all Granger that are just being a sign of a ... well and\nI Want to do something you said about gee because this has been such a tale of two industrial for the last few years and no one's covered it candidly better and more closely than you\nWhy is it that honey well has been able to be this kind of well managed steady Eddie growth engine while G. E. has\nBecome synonymous with corporate drama and\nYou know essentially big existential questions around its future\nSure well I mean it wasn't always this way so Dave Cody was brought into D. C. E. O. after GE he tried to buy her a while and that whole deal fell apart Honeywell was a bit of a mess that done that's really not great deal with allied signal and Dave Coney really had to do a lot of cleanup work and that took ... years\nBut then you know once you sort of got that stabilized I think probably the biggest difference is capital allocation you know Dave Cody bought a lot of companies that they tend to be smaller they tended to be really strategic any kind of didn't really get a lot out of them versus GE significantly overpaid for a number of different deals um\nAnd it just never really it struggled to follow through so it would show up in these markets and it would be late to the market having spent a lot of money and then the business would just at best maybe get lost in GE the conglomerate or at worse turn into a big problem like the Austin deal well go ahead\nWell I was just gonna say and it feels like Cody managed his succession\nA lot more cleanly then clearly ...\nYes I think that's really fair to say and I think he made a great choice and ... and ... is very different from Dave Cody he's much um he's quiet areas more reserved is more of a technocrat and the best sense of the word\nOn is this software background which I think they've Cody really realize that that was where industrial companies for going into hunting well probably need somebody with experience in that and who would have more of that growth so you\nHave to be honest my father worked for Ben decks which became allied signal which became ultimately Honeywell so we kinda grew up like living through all the gyrations and the deals\nI'm but I'm curious because they're now aerospace right their home and building technologies they've got a couple of different segments are these the markets that they should be in is that what I Do Alice does the investment community kind of like where they are I think\nSo so they've done a couple of spin offs that are in the works right now if you remember download came in and said they should spin off their ... and they said well we're not going to do that we're going to spin off and that they're in a good thing right it had\nBeen a good thing because they've got huge gross from that airspace business a lot of what Dan Loeb with arguing with you know there have been weakness in the business job market because there were so much a use inventory and that's really started to turn around at the physically this quarter you saw a really good growth in that business shut market so it's a good thing that any real hot I held onto it\nUm but they are spinning off their turbo chargers business that actually happened already on his number first\nAnd then they're consumer facing home technologies business that will happen on October twenty nights\nNow I think people are pretty comfortable with the mix of businesses hunting will have after those spin off\nBut I think the question is do they need to do acquisition because the spin offs will create a pretty meaningful amount of earnings delusion um that hunting will ... will have to work to offset somehow in one obviously to do that through ... well it can have\nYou here especially given I said earlier without asking you about gee coming up in a new CEO in the seat what it'd be early signs from what you're hearing from people you talked to one of the\nObservations are so I just my personal experience I don't think companies delays earnings announcements because they have so much good news just want to build and that's why I'm you know I I'm the one hand I understand that this is a very complicated situation gee is still a very complicated company and I think Larry Cole\nA very complicated situation gee is still a very complicated company and I think Larry called\nMaybe perhaps realizes that when the c._e._o. announcement was made people really latched onto the fact that there was not a conference call there is not a fly back there was not a lot of details at all and I think that er an G E yeah very un GE and probably to the detriment and so I think you know he probably wants to have a pretty clear\nMessage he knows he's going to get a lot of questions so he's probably trying to finesse that does that mean extent but\nThere you can't get away from the fact is is going to be a very very messy quarter we already know there's going to be that good will impairment charge that if that's going to be almost twenty three billion but we don't know a lot of the physics of that because see a dip it in ... and actually raised I mean there's a lot of nasty things that could be coming\nAnd we also know that he's not going to get a lot of shots of getting all the bad news out right I mean does that really the the Flint early plan or a lesson right as I get it all out there that sort of drip drip drip for shoe after she left her shoe dropping not gonna almost\nSeeming the meetings with his team say I want to know it off\nNow me every day

and everything else that you want [noise]\nSo I think we're going to do very well I think we're going to do extremely well with the Senate [noise] we have races that we weren't even got a contest numerous of them as you know and now we're actually leading and many of those races [noise]\nYou know these were spots I won't use names but these were ... we weren't really looking to fight because we thought they would be one\nThat I think that justice Kavanaugh had a big impact\nLending my rallies has a big impact to be honest with you because there's a there's a lot of love and those rallies a lot of it a lot of lot of action going on and ah [noise] nah but a lot of things happening I think we're going to do very well with the Senate and house has so many button and I think we're going to do very well with a house I really do\nWell in talking about when it comes down to the terms in Congress said this week at Kavanaugh and its caravan Kavanaugh you've gotten through that's ... news on that as well today it looks like they're turning around can you tell us on that and you sit down there and there's this little\nCritters said and I think they're turning around and we chose Guatemala

that doesn't work we're going to call out the military when a close up the border which is going to close it up because we can't have people coming in like this so we will close up our border\nAnd it's all because the Democrats refused to give us laws that work we have laws that were made by idiots we have laws that were made that are that are beyond\nAnybody's comprehension the whole world is laughing at these laws catch and release a visa lottery here where we take people through a lottery system and you know who's going into the lottery they're not giving us air financed\nAnd you just look at it a chain migration so somebody comes in and all of a sudden you bring twenty four twenty eight thirty to people with that person [noise]\nIt's crazy so uh we're going to have a change and the Democrats have to do it and I think it's going to cost a very big in the election when you see a caravan like that that was in some people coming up now are we think we're going to have it stopped\nIs going to be stopped one way or the other they might as well turn around because it's going to be stopped one way or the other\nBut the Democrats should change these laws we have it all done it's beautiful what we have and what we proposed but we need to have votes that's why the elections aboard 'cause we have majorities but they're tiny we don't have enough votes in the Senate when he's sixty votes well when nine shores\nAnd if you don't have sixty you're not going to do it so we don't have the votes that's why the election is so important\nI tend to and in fact that this
