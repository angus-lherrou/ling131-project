took the person anyway [laughter] it just pretended [laughter] [laughter] hey yeah I I don't even has the phone number ... see him are you calling Sarah appealing right now\nFrom can if you want me to well you have the number given a call let's see I mean [noise] seriously a lot of people do impersonation of a governor\nAnd here's here's what's real carrying you know this the only reason why I'm

something\nYeah now in God just wrote back could do is have you been better number\nSo I'm like I just I just went on Twitter ...\nAnd I said hello Hi governor I haven't gotten a response yet that's starting to tell me something\nYeah\nI mean the waste their immune to just completely blown off I'm not blowing wrong [laughter]\nRight now I'm just trying to be real here go through these many ... said he just got a second number well I mean of course you have to jump through these ... she was the vice presidential candidate she was the natural nominees and there are a lot of people who are not you know he just ...\nYou know I think I mean a lot easier than that\nWell I don't know you never know\nI think it'd be very easy just to just to like my comment Hi governor Sam are you talking to somebody on the phone\n[noise] um I just can't get in the first number and had to delete it [laughter]\nOkay so they sent to the second number to call the second number I'm\nI'll tell you this is the

exhausting for those of us who are anxious that this election of twenty sixteen will never end your column points to a couple of things that I have not seen at ... so I Want to feature them\nThe first one that grabs me and it bothered me the whole time Dan is that there's something of the anti clerical voice in the opposition to judge Kavanaugh as if there is wrong with being a very well educated young Catholic man\nWho goes to adjust to it school and conduct himself well in the world it's a puzzle to me Dan how do you hear it you because you you noted in your column in in one of the penultimate paragraphs but you didn't expand on a good evening to\nHi there John while I was referring to the um the relentless references to a\nJudge Kavanaugh attending Georgetown Prep a and the idea of being conveyed implicitly advocate has more directly and articles and places like the Washington Post or the Georgetown Prep in suburban Washington\nThe Washington Post was the Georgetown Prep\nIn suburban Washington and the Maryland suburbs was a a breeding ground in the Nineteen eighties\nFor ah abusers of women that it was a just a school for rich kids who got drunk and went out on the weekend and uh [noise] that did this sort of thing a Georgetown Prep in fact is an all\nBoys just what high school it was founded in Seventeen eighty nine by archbishop John Carroll at the same time he was founding\nGeorgetown University the nation's oldest Catholic university\nIn Georgetown Prep is one of many ... such just what high schools across the country who um [noise]\n... ... in fact uh give young men are extraordinarily strong education rooted in Catholic ideas and uh just what principles\nAnd uh Neil Gorsuch for instance among the alumni of Georgetown Prep\nAnd um I think it was related as well to something that a Senator Dianne Feinstein brought up in the confirmation hearing for Amy Coney Barrett when she was being nominated to the appeals court\nAnd judge Feinstein asked a is Barrett whether her Catholicism was dogmatic on issues such as roe v Wade and the idea that it's one son frequently hears that a\nA Catholic in public life is going to be a have their public views are directed by dog ma\nMaking the wedding happy Jemma very good evening to you the Commerce Department and the Labor Department reported in these last days lots of news that all looks positive to me but I'm a consumer of news and you are a newsman so\nThe jobless rate fell to three point seven percent according to the Labor Department which is the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine I think that's Richard Nixon I was a young person in Nineteen sixty nine I had no idea we had it's so good\nEmployers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs to payrolls I'm following Eric morass inherit tore in the wall Street Journal\nWhich is a Ninety six straight months gain wages rose to point eight percent from a year old earlier solid if a if still an spectacular rise the quote from the chief economist at glass door this is the best job market in a generation or more\nMr McCray you are cautious to the point of being a bear is this good news for main street good evening to\nJohn yeah it's terrific news for main street it's not great news for Wall Street and I'll explain that\nBut in terms of street uh we saw John games and all the good sectors we sold job gains and the high paying energy sector we saw job gains and the hype in construction sector we saw job gains in the high paying manufacturing sector\nWhere we did not where we purportedly saw ... was in retail and they are phantom losses a corresponding Hurricane Florence\nA year over year retail has actually added twenty five thousand jobs and there are a this was a positive sign a there are close to eight hundred and fifty thousand job openings in retail which is a record and the reason that's positive this is\nA retail jobs is or the next step up from slavery except if you're now like Amazon and getting Fifteen dollars an hour\nBut in most retail outlets or you're working at slave wages and people are just turning their nose up at their jobs because those jobs because they can that's a great sign for the economy\nWe have some numbers here a gym that I Want to help you help me interpret I was always told that four percent was the lowest we could go but they're not projecting that we're going to get to a three point five percent next year and and I mean this is hard to believe\nThat we'll have this uh at at remain below four percent through twenty Twenty one are we out to people I is this the robots what's doing this I didn't think this was possible ever and what we've got it for two years\nAh you know what it turns out the birth control pill wasn't such a great idea yeah we are short of people uh immigration reform is really a front it should be a front burner issue and it isn't\nA you know you're here in my community I live in Alexandria, Virginia or the public buses and not only do they flash the destination on their sons they have a war nut\nOr are they desperately need us drivers man you know your listeners see it everywhere help wanted signs everywhere there is a shortage\nOf man power in the U.S and a lot of it is due to the crackdown on your legal immigrants and stricter border control now I'm not saying that's a bad thing but we need reform so that we can get\nA workers in another country ASAP workers for all levels of jobs\nWorkers in another country ASAP\nWorkers for all levels of jobs but let's pay attention now to the part of the job the part of the jobs that Dr ... the high paying jobs where the wages go up is that what explains the two point eight percent remember we complained for years\nThat the wages were not moving they are moving now although we were not according to the wall Street Journal\nTo associate the word spectacular with the movement but they're still moving is this because people are bidding higher for their employees that what's doing this\n... yes it's throughout the economy I mean you can see the stories in the paper about the fast food franchise owners who were offering a four year college tuition and then and pay hikes are offering all kinds of perks to\nA a common plenty plenty to play but I hear from people is a yeah I'm working I've got a job but I what I really need are benefits so I think you're seeing more companies\nOffer some benefits to attract workers in many cases benefits outweigh the pay increase so yeah so that you know that two percent might seem low but but there's something else going on and it's a I think it's a a an an employee ease market right now\nIn other words the uh the employer has the employee has the upper hand\nThat would explain the Amazon although that I thought that was very short on their part because it forces the competition to match them it's a it's a good headline I Want to look at why it is the Federal Reserve thinks the economy's going to continue so well off are they in charge of the money supply\nThe Federal Reserve is a saying that there's no recession insight and one could show up we could have a dead set back with a catastrophe like an asteroid and they are going to continue to raising rates and yet the market is ignoring it so let's go from Maine straight to Wall Street Wall Street's delighted with this gym\n[noise] it is but it's not necessarily good for the stock market it could be good for investors because what's happening is you know we talked about this in the past\nOr the stock market was up in large part because it was being subsidized by the Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates so low that the only game in town if you were looking for a positive return was stocks which which is really outside the risk profile of a lot of older Americans\nBut our interest rates are on the increase so you're going to see money coming out of the stock market and going into bonds and certificates of deposits which are offering a good returns so the stock market\nPulled back or you know we'll have some sort of a correction maybe it'll last six months or so or I'm not saying we're having this correction now but when ... when he comes out and goes elsewhere but as the money goes into CDs\nIt gives the uh uh it's it increases our ... our savings so in the long run it means that banks will be able to offer credit\nAt a lower rate to industry so we'll have this transitional period where it will be a ... an hour to an audience stocks but for the long run it's it's very good for the economy\nThe trade story well we are at odds with China they're not talking about the deal is in place for\nWhat used to be called NAFTA now us MCA the Europeans are looking for conversations bilateral deals our economy's doing extremely well four percent plus the last quarter and protections that same for this quarter\nEuropeans not so much Chinese negative\nJapan is even a little sluggish so is the trade story hurting us or is this why is this why we're booming and they're not\nWhat the story\nWill hurt us going forward because really you know we're at China is has been waging a and underhanded war against the U.S economy we are just waking up to the acts act Bloomberg kind of wonderful report this week with on how Chinese computer companies were putting ... chips in or\nYeah I saw that that ... that just just blatant piracy on their part caught yes\nYes so I mean I think this trade war with China is a long term if they are because it involves our national security and I think our manufacturers will be shifting to other countries are like Cambodia believe it or not and Vietnam\nA China's going to be hurt in the long run because of the militancy or the United states at some point we're all going to be playing it taking more money for things we take for granted for being cheap like sneakers and T shirts and that kinda stuff\nUh but I think Americans or whether they love ... a Trump or hate him boy will rally around the flag on this issue because again it's national security or the Chinese are trying to hurt us or they're shipping illegal opioids into the country either you know they're they're stealing our our stuff\nI'm so a short term pain or maybe in two thousand Ninety two thousand twenty\nOr long term it's a good for the U.S economy\nJim

MCAA the trade deal that will replace NAFTA makes its way through the legislature is that the U.S Canada and Mexico the U.S China trade war shows no signs of stopping speaking with Bloomberg national economic council chairman Larry Kudlow discussed the state of U.S China trade talks\nWe like to talk of this is\nTalk of the better than not talk to somebody like this officer as we've made our asks perfectly well\nAs ... says [noise]\nTheir responses laughing satisfactory but that doesn't mean they will always be satisfactory\nJourney Leonard is a Bloomberg News trade reporters who joins us now for more on this story from our boomer Ninety nine one studios in Washington and Jenny I Want to get to the U.S China a trade war in a moment but first really want to talk about the uh big um deep dive that your team did\nOn the new North American trade deal and how close it came to not coming together tell us about it\nYeah so we really saw how the sausages handmade which is not always pretty um and this was a Thirteen month process that was\nHad a lot of posturing and as we know a lot of tweets we had backtracking from the president where\nAre you know he wasn't sure if he was going to keep the deal in place they're not uh and so in the end it really came down to and actually the president's son in law Jared Kushner who got a lot of credit from negotiators to just keep everyone kind of calm\nIn the heat of the moment\nAnd then it came down to those issues that the country ... kept closest to the vest until the last moment and then once those who are shown the cards were shown it all kind of fell in line\nYeah I wondered about that after what appeared to be an impasse and we're talking about more than a year of incremental progress did somebody blink [noise]\nI think they probably blinked at the same time they needed to uh and probably what the Mexicans 'cause we know the Mexican deal happened before the Canadian deal came together and so the Mexicans were actually also instrumental in the background really holding in the U. S. ing Canada's hand and saying you know we get there together\nAt so they probably blinked at the same time ... was Mexico support\nSo is the U. S. M. C. A. a roadmap for resolving the U.S China trade war\nI think it's a more a we get a really important thing out of the way to get to the China trade war and resolving those issues are as you know it was a lot of uncertainty around this deal because it's more than one trillion and trade\nOr you know the U.S business community the U.S Congress was really really anxious about you know getting this wrapped up and so I think moving moving forward with this\nWe'll take probably the court three to four months to decide after that at least and so\nThat's the first step is is the Trump Administration coming in or against this California law and asking the judge to hit pause don't let states come in and start adopting their own laws we got a first we need to find out if the the federal move a is lawful\nDoes the Justice Department have a point here the state's gonna regulate interstate commerce and the Internet is interstate is interstate commerce\nYeah I I think it's ultimately going to be a an uphill battle for the states uh to to win as a legal matter they they they have some some strong arguments to say that that the the Federal Communications itself\nMaybe shouldn't be in the business of preempting of of declaring that its rules are superior to the stages there's there are serious legal questions whether the FCC itself has that power but that's sort of different from the larger question that you touched on\nThis is likely interstate commerce in it it's hard to imagine the Internet functioning all that effectively\nIf the rules of the road change as Internet traffic passes over state lines or into even if you go down to the city or county level if a state can do it could've could've city or county start to impose its own rules it\nStarts to be giving give the ... industry a pretty powerful argument that this is not the way that the inter Internet can function there's a pretty strong a constitutional argument under the commerce clause that that just doesn't work\nOn the action in Sacramento by the by the fed it ... is has a federal judge scheduled to a hearing on this is he going to hear this this week\nWe we are at the very beginning stages\nI think we'll have more of a sense on timing in the next couple of weeks here but the last set to take effect on January first so there's not a lot of time to to work out how they're going to brief and decide\nA a potential stay that the Trump administration's at looking for here so I expect we'll see developments pretty quickly on that initial question should we pause that California law for now\n[noise] so where does ... where where do the FCC's changes to the Obama neutrality laws stand have have they been implemented while all this get hashed out in ... ... you know take your pick of courts\nRight right no great question and so yes the the short answer is yes right now the the deregulatory move by the Trump FCC is the law of the land\nAnd and there are no net neutrality rules on the book at this point\nAbout the lawsuits have been consolidated in the DC circuit court of appeals here it's being brief now set for argument's a February one uh of next year we should see a decision from from that courts a you know in June July was when you got to start looking really closely for it\nI'm just curious how did the companies in Silicon valley feel about the state law did they support it\nYeah I so they you know the the Internet Association which represents groups are like Google and uh uh like the other shows ... exactly exactly so they have been big supporters of of net neutrality generally and so\nAnd so I guess they they'd been backers of of of net neutrality they're participating in the lawsuit in at the DC circuit\nOr against the FCC are saying that that the net neutrality that the FCC went too far in deregulating here\nAnd and so yes there their backers of the net neutrality ...\n... ... and and as far as the critics of the FCC's moves you know they were saying oh you know we're going to see ... again are going to say prioritization again have we seen any evidence that the that that's been happening since the FCC no\nNo no I mean I don't think we have\nAnd uh I but I think in part you know there there's something to be said about ... you know that would this isn't the right time for those now the broadband companies would be right and\nIf they were thinking about doing that well this isn't litigation they don't want to give any you don't want to give it a a ... and that's you know Charlie supporters\nThat exactly exactly so it's sort of a ... even though there are there may be no laws on the books are in effect right now there there is an effective check\nOn uh the companies are from doing you know\nReally agree just things with their network management now now they might like to pursue some things that they think are are positives for consumers where you know you you hear about the zero rating plans or where the the companies say hey we ... we we might feel that treat some traffic in a in a way that that that consumers like uh\nSo we should you know take the handcuffs off us let us do this stuff and will will manage it in a

psychiatric things like unemployment wages inflation poverty\nAnd we've seen specifically over the last month but over the course of President Trump's term that the council of economic advisors has

since the end of the Obama administration but we saw a new report last month from the council of economic advisors that sort of fudge the numbers in different ways including different types of measurements and came up with this study showing that wages are actually actually at one point four percent\nA much higher than the the flat number that we're getting from the Labor Department so

every three bites of food we eat is made possible by bees with many bee species under threat\nThere are new efforts now to save the creatures joining us Kelsey Graham postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State university first of all Kelsey tell us more about the ways that bees not only support our fruits and veggies but also the meat tweet\nBees actually pony alfalfa and that's something that we feed to our livestock so now that we wouldn't have much food and dinner scene our diet\nAnd so specifically what function to be performed to make sure we have healthy natural areas\nPretty much every flower garden or wind farm planting it's probably visited by a Pinter either a B or a butterfly or ma but these are the most efficient at\nPollinating flowers so they actually will collect pollen for food and then move this pollen between flowers and that allows for propagation of new flowers so that's how they reproduce\nAnd without movement of pollen we wouldn't have as many plans or vegetables or fruit available I\nShouldn't we've already heard a lot about honeybees which are not native to this country being under threat but how native bees doing\nWe have around four thousand to five thousand native bees and North America\nAnd they all have really different life history trade on our social summer on tearing really big one little ones but those diversity come the challenge of trying to figure out how each of them are doing and that's really\nYeah come the challenge of trying to figure out how each of them are dealing and that's really a big question mark still at this point we knew a bit about bumble bee is they're probably most of our I'm native bees in North America you know a bit about them but then the rest of the species we really know very little about\nYou've launched a study to compare what the number of visas and now with their past populations and also you're checking to see what areas that don't have many bees what does the check by area tell us this is\nKind of preliminary but were seemed to be finding a lot of these really intensive agriculture areas areas that you know have a lot of real crops like corn soybean but also those that are managed like orchards farms\nHave less native bees than perhaps wild areas that are less disturbed than our agricultural areas\nAnd doesn't this also inform how we would go about conserving bees\nDefinitely so improving the habitat\nIs lacking beans and particularly habitat\nThat really need bees places like flu very farms cherry orchard that need bees to create fruit and he's a really important areas for improving the habitat specifically for being so\nPutting in wildfire planting doing other management so we can improve the bees in those areas because we need them so critically for that agriculture\nSo your project is going to provide a baseline then for future comparisons on how things are going isn't that right\n[laughter] exactly right because we know so little about our native bees we kinda need is that just a bass lines of figuring out where we had native bees what's the general ... and and diversity in different habitats\nAnd then moving forward we can look at trends so doing a really robust baseline survey of beans right now is really important moving forward we can see of conservation is actually helping the bees and different management strategies that that's changing the diversity in abundance of bees moving forward\nWe're visiting with Kelsey Graham postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State university about efforts to understand bees which are critical for producing our food\nKelsey let's get into the factors that may be playing a role in reducing the number of bees that you mentioned one about over farming but what are some of the others\nKind of along with agriculture we also have exposure to pesticides and that's kind of really hot topic right now for beans many different pesticides or being tested right now you can figure out which ones are really having a detrimental impact on bees which ones are kind of more be friendly and be safe\nNow inform the management strategies we can use going forward\nAnd then kind of similarly we have destruction of habitat not just in agricultural settings but urban landscapes if you have a field over for a parking lot that is taking away both flowers which is what these need to eat\nAnd also nesting habitat the majority of our native bees actually nest in the ground so\nProviding candidates safe ground nesting habitat it's also really vital so any of these disturbed areas are going to have an impact on that need to be community knows when we think about some movies in particular\nHas been pathogens are playing a big role so that's kind of one of the main focus is Freda bumble bee research right now particularly on the ... which is the rest of your ... will be in this was recently put on the endangered species list and you definitely think pathogens might be playing a role there too in their decline\nNow without getting into the debate on pesticides for the homeowner at least can we summarized by saying it's really important to use pesticides according to package directions\nAbsolutely please read the label make sure you're not using pesticides and be friendly plants so if it's blooming if it's being visited diabetes please don't use pesticides fees are active during the day so most of them you say for forging so they're out when the sun is out\nSo definitely if you can avoid using any pesticide during the day\nThat will definitely help decrease the chance to appease in contact with pesticides and also if you want to go even further you can pretty much remove pesticide use from your back yard you can choose certain plants that are going to have left has pressures and you know look prettier in your yard so planting native\nPlants to your area can really help with that\nAnd also picking my aunt so when you go to the nursery haven't already been seen treated\nTells me do you believe that climate change may be playing a role in reducing the number of bees\nYeah that's definitely a very interesting new topic that's growing and the research world\nWe definitely think the bees or polish shifting their ranges so you know a more northern species might be decreasing of finance at its southern area of its range and likewise might be you know moving up in elevation to Lloyd's hot weather so definitely climate change we think it's going to have an impact on where bees are and that's going to\nNeed to inform evaluations about how bee populations are changing in different areas\nIf a person listening to this wants to help conserve bees what can they do\nMy number one in ... to plant flowers these need flowers they're vegetarians they only eat pollen and nectar\nSo if you can put more flowers and the environment that's really going to help the beans and if you live in an urban environment you can put out parts of flowers you don't need to have a big ... huge pollinate our garden little things can really really help\nAnd what about joining say a conservation organization or the park district might have something\nAbsolutely I always encourage people you know if you're really interested in you want to do more we have set up our own place where you can go and find out more about pollinators at ... dot MSU dot edu\nSo you can get on

treated so differently than our physical health\nWhy is mental health treated so differently than our physical health\nBecause a lot of times people when they think about mental health they don't look at it as a I mean obviously with physical health is easier for you to\nKind of focus on that but I have a lot of times people don't take that seriously they kinda\nDon't understand that you also have a mental wellness\nJust enormous situations you think that you could just deal with most things but a lot of times the mental health issues a lot of people just take for granted like normal issues like anxiety or depression that most people have\nBeen in sometimes people will have to realize that when mental wellness it can be disorders or some kinks in the armor so most people\nDon't look at it that serious but it is to look at it like this your brain is Oregon just like your heart and your lungs and the other or parts of your body and so when something goes wrong in your body you you normally say I need help but sometimes with the brain people don't look at it that way\nAlso you can look at somebody you can see a burn you can see a broken bone or you can see cancer on on a CD scanned there's a lot of things we have to see these other illnesses mental illness there's really not a way to see a mental illnesses or\nYou know and that's what makes it a little bit more difficult because\nYou necessarily can't see it but that's why it's important to kinda bring awareness to it because when people are dealing with some mental illness some changes in their behavior workers such as irritability or so forth so it's important to not only recognize that you might not see it in a way that you\nWill see a physical illness but it's still the same point\nAnd there's a myriad of mental illness from depression to schizophrenia and suicide itself if not a mental illness it's it's an action but in most cases and underlying mental illness drives people to suicide and it seems to be on the rise white suicide on the rise these days\nTo be honest with you a suicide rates have been increasing over the last several years but I think what's happening is that a lot of wearing this has been brought to\nIt it always was somewhat intriguing to me that is a uniquely human problem in that it's it's anesthetic go to our survival dry that you don't see examples of suicide in the animal world it's like as people were almost too smart for our own good why do we come to the conclusion that suicide is the right way out\nYou know let's go back to what we said as far as the brain and sometimes people reach a point or psychologically whether they feel hopelessness despair and so it's not necessarily well a lot of people want to commit suicide they reach a low point in their life and they're dealing with so many issues and then their brain they feel like there's no way out\nNow take for example you might have some celebrity such as Whitney Houston prints and Michael Jackson out we were assumed that they didn't want to die\nBut they were self medicating with medicine and pain medication to cover up some of the pain like we talked about before that you can see in situations like that they end up that drug or whatever it takes their life but suicide itself people read certain points in their life and they see no way out\nAs you point Alabama on the Alabama radio network and I'm speaking with Dr Moore a document what about demographic concerns I realize this crosses all races sexes shows should everybody but are there any groups are situations that increase a person's susceptibility\nFor example in the African American community or the lack of accessibility to services and\nThe stigma and some of the traditional cultures surrounding mental health has allow people to have certain issues and go untreated\nAnd so in some areas for example in the Native American community they have a higher incidence of alcoholism in their culture they want to keep some of the issues to get together so they don't want to go seek help because it's a tough act of shame if you go get help a insult some some similar to the African American community\nAnd I know Dr more we as men we're a little less likely to go to the doctor to seek help because we want to be strong we don't want to let people know or hurting or that we have a problem that we can't solve do men have a problem because of that\nSort of ... exactly a lot of the statistics are men are going up but it's not that is going up because they haven't been doing it and say more men are self reporting now whereas in the past man was suffering and it wasn't necessarily documented\nBut it's very difficult for a lot of men that come to therapy and counseling because they see it as a sign of

said no sends me a email says I never like Susan Collins wow I'm Glad that I've been wrong\nFirst time I Am impressed by that woman so no uh likes her and a steam\nSusan Collins delivery one of the most important eloquent intelligent political speeches I ever heard in my sixty nine years of life I Am a student of political\nScience the question is did ... ... is this is she went through the litany of here's what I studied this is what I took into account this is what I heard here are the facts but you know that this argument has devolved into an emotional argument\nSo facts ...\n... where where where's the emotion that's what people are really caught up in this one way or the other it's all about the emotion\nPhone number here is eight five five to nine five sixty six hundred oh there's our friend John in Reno nevada Hi John what do you make of this dog\n... you're given up their ... of this whole thing you know you're actually showing both sides\nI think that the Democrats the Democrats now the best they can do really would be to get up\nTo the voter locked arms and just walk out of the walk out of the Senate room\nBecause the issue of the math on land going up to Montana\nThat got out at least I think fifty one senators they're ready to vote\nTo create a courtroom\nAnd that would be a good way for them to protest all says that the president gave them a flawed candidate\nAnd he's trying to ... down their throats and they should just say no we're not going to participate in this process\nWhich is kind of get out there that they did during the Clinton impeachment air and it seemed to work pretty\nWell uh I I I'm Glad you I'm Glad you said this I wasn't that nobody else it brought that up but you're absolutely right article one section five of the constitution requires a quorum fifty one centers be president for the Senate to conduct business [noise] interesting\nWell look at you John Mr constitutional expert [laughter] I um [noise] I thought they were going to do that I thought they were going to do that this morning did you see when they started the roll call\nUh all the Republican senators were in place sitting behind the desk in their chairs and over on the the Democrats' side of the Senate I counted at least twenty ... seats that were empty\nAnd I thought well they finally came walking in and they came in late I think that we're waiting to see how the vote was going to go I don't know what they're thinking\nBut um I Wonder if uh if you know what you know that there's some parliamentarian there in the Senate this going you want to do this\n[noise] how do you think that would look though about this whole business\nUh this whole thing has been disgraceful I think I Do the whole process has been just an absolute disgrace and parties are going to be blamed for the Democrats blame the Republicans Republicans blamed Democrats but there's\nThere's some I Want to say there is some independence out there and there's some\nIn the truly in the middle that are looking at this in in making judgment the Democrats on the committee and the Republicans on the committee [noise] I don't know if it'll hurt Joe\nJoe mansion he wants to sit with all those Republican goes that's not going to be a good look for him as a as a die you know democratic name All right well the earliest Cohen West Virginia is everything coal is king you know and he feels like right\nHe's got it back the coal industry there's a lot of the downsides of the call sue in terms of safety and now not in\nAn odd and was not in West Virginia there is not John there's no downside that's that's that's their bread and butter and their fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers have been uh I get your point but that's that is you know Joe mansion yes is it is a Democrat in name only the state\nOr he is the head of the of the Republican candidate a real clear politics says he's ahead by over nine points over Patrick Morrisey so mansion has always been\nA conservative Democrat in West Virginia so I\nWasn't surprised at all by the fact that he's voting for Kevin I'm\nAnd she didn't want to commit perjury\nBut it sounds like Monica McLean was witness tampering with legal and Keyser to change and tell a lie to the FBI and to the Senate Judiciary committee investigators\n\nSo will the department of justice follow up on this will they prosecute on this probably not in a hundred years\n\nSo at the end legal in Kaiser did adjust her statement she says she believed Dr forward story but she's still could not recalled the party and she could not recall ever meeting Brett Kavanaugh\nWell apparently\nChristine Blasey Ford wasn't real happy about all of that\nI'm\nBorn suggested during her testimony that Keyser was withholding saying that she understood she had health issues that would make it impossible for her to come and testify\n\nAnd that was a rather stunning slapping someone that basically\nChristine Blasey Ford had pulled into the whole story\n\nAnd I'm sure Leland Kaiser wasn't happy about that so that may be why you know she has medical problems\nIn other words she's nuts\nThat may be exactly why Leland Kaiser share the tax that she got from a plane and felt free to discuss the pressure that she got to change her testimony and lie about her own memories so I look at this all by the way\nYou don't work Christine Blasey Ford was she wasn't in California nobody knew that well I mean\nThat the Republicans did not know that Charles Grassley did not know that Christine Blasey Ford was not in California they talking about how she had to move and run and the family in a bit outside her house and everything else ah she was she was in Delaware when she wrote a letter to the Washington Post\nAnd to Dianne Feinstein that letter was written in Delaware\nHope with Delaware well who lives in real hope with Delaware that\nWould be Monica McLean\nSo it appears as though Christine Blasey Ford was in Delaware with Monica McLean are longtime body and they sat down and crafted the letter that went to Feinstein and the Washington Post\n\nAnd then you go back McLean Monica McLean are tied in very strongly to some top top top Democrats lawyer operatives\nSo\nI'm Sorry I I wanted to believe that Christine Blasey Ford was in fact a victim I'm telling the truth but she was mixed up on her on her facts but the more I look at this background and I hope they do follow it up\nThere it raises all kinds of smelly smelly stinky meter problem Stengel meters going way off on this one that somebody somewhere\nWas at least witness tampering and who knows how much of that letter that went to Feinstein with the Washington Post was actually true so that's why\nAt four o'clock this morning Grassley Chuck Grassley\nSent a letter to Christine Blasey Ford's lawyers\nSaying that the probe may have turned up something significant\nOn Dianne Feinstein and my and Mazie Hirono and he wanted all the records between Feinstein and Mazie Hirono and Christine for Christine Blasey Ford and her lawyers and um all of them\n\nBecause none of those records those letters a polygraph exams none of that stuff has ever been turned over to the Republicans on the committee\nWhy not and what Grassley says is well it appears that if you don't turn it over it basically makes it look like you're hiding something\n\nSo even though it looks like Kavanaugh is going to get the boat I'm not sure this whole big fight and or what happened in this whole scenario will is just going to go away we'll be right

about a a boyfriend a leading you you know when you're upset when you feel like you've been scorn somebody's cheated on you're going to go in and and start trolling them\nDoing some of this uh\nUh what are they called revenge porn or does any of that sound familiar does that does that sound like men are doing it is\nWhat do they call a revenge porn or does any of that sound familiar does it does that sound like men are doing it as a more so and women are never well we're going to talk about that a little bit\nThroughout the show today but also I Want to touch base with you because founder grassroots or the grass roots organization\n... association group grassroots or conservative association group\nAh gosh I'll get it right Corey retired United States Marine Corps colonel Corey Duncan\nCouldn't talk to us a little bit about some of the things listen he's a passionate man I Love listening to him 'cause he'll tell you about some of the things that are happening in the education system guys when\nI just think about this for a minute when did the right give up on education when did we see that over to the left so the ah the sex drugs rock and roll crew of the sixties all of a sudden got their PHD's\nAnd now they are teaching your children and instead of teaching your children to think independently to see what they're doing go to school regurgitate exactly what I said and you'll get an a challenge me and you're a racist\nThey never had the courage to say that before you know they didn't they just said oh you're thinking is not properly in the line with the organizational systematic oh gosh I'm\nAsk anybody who's gone to college who doesn't think down the mainstream liberal far left now school of thought and what they'll tell you is there are punished ... young men young women they go to school that challenge some of the concepts of hey are you sure that's the way things are supposed to be\nReal Joe I like real job because you know that other Joe on the uh B. S. N. B. C. station [laughter] where where he he used to be Joe and I don't know what he is he was a conservative and now he's not and then uh he and his wife decided to separate after they uh you know the story is personal life says problem\nBut apparently the real Joe Joe Messina has a relationship with the gentleman by the name of Corey dunk and in fact the conservative association group the grassroots conservative association groups\nTo chairman founder retired United States Marine Corps colonel ... Duncan is with us how are you Cory\nI'm doing very well so pleasant to pay this weekend or five ... thanks for having me sir\nYou're welcome welcome to the show you know we were talking a little bit off the air is uh\nI first of all I Love listening to you know every time you're on the show I I get a little snippet of it sometimes a little bit more than others [laughter] I like what you stand for Mr because this is a big deal our education system has changed dramatically\nThey used to be a conservative place it used to be America First we love the constitution we love hard work\nWhen we think there is such thing as American exceptionalism which means\nWe are special country and all of a sudden these folks teaching our kids don't seem to believe that [noise]\nAbsolutely are well what we we are on me and my wife and it was the plea into politics or we're going to give you a little while and now we we have one day you know thought about it and it was like you know if that's the same old same old\nAnd not not to say there wasn't anybody else to do on this not it's not ... to ... you know you know what was that it's not important but we believe me and I believe right now in our family our family\nTogether believes in education and\nThat's been forgotten in between talked about all of the politics and everything and I'm Sorry you know a lot of people increases every week but it is is the truth and you know it's been forgotten and because there was talk about\nWhat's the hot topic about you know Kevin said well you know the topic that you know that the next person that's kind of an attack there's probably a young person is walking past this heart and mind is that the conservatives he make her Christian conservatives and\nAnd then they cannot be forgotten ... where where they have to be fully dedicated\nTo this type of moment because you can't say you can't you know one thing you can't tell a child or something like I'm going to do something or I'm going to this is what are for you and then then take and do something else\nBecause then then then you lose the trust of the person and and children more acceptable as young adults but I'm not talking about people who are no I was always say children by what you say are young young Americans do\nThey understand exactly what we advocate and we're we're ... we're we're pushing forward and and and we have to do this in her corner now\nWe ... you're saying this stuff and you're you're saying this and as if it sounds than it's coming from a place for most Americans say well we don't want to offend those other folks we don't want to look for so long the left has blurred\nThey blurred whenever you study illegal immigrant whenever I said you know the little illegal immigration they hear that they run a filter and purposely\nI used to think they did it on accident said purpose\nThey run a tour a filter and purposely I used to think they did it on accident stay purposely will spit it out back to you in a life and say you don't like immigrants goals I I I didn't say that I said illegal immigrant today with the Kavanaugh hearings they take\nAny woman anybody that says there are victims\nAnd they now run out through a filter and say you you hate all\nAssault victims all all a rape victims so oh that's not what I'm saying I'm questioning this lady I'm questioning this time because one hundred percent of what she has said except for her words right one hundred percent of her argument has been proven to be incorrect or false\nThe four friends had no idea that she was there uh she uh they forget to say that she had to Dr Ford\nYou know she remembered this right after her parents lost their home in foreclosure to a judge Kavanaugh the mother\nOf Mr capital of judge Kavanaugh so why don't we know this break the bank and Dr ... parents many years ago went before a judge capping off his mother\nAnd the judge she ruled in favor of the bank or the creditor her but if it was a banker or carry a hedge but I don't know who own it and so the last name is the same in this town is not a big deal it's not a it's not a secret who his mother was\nHis mother used to teach in an inner city she used to teach children in an inner city she's not a dummy and then sure enough within a couple of years or so Dr Ford remembers that this attack occurred and it must have been Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise] well that's kind of interesting why don't we pull here you're hurting your book so suddenly somebody grabs hold hold her your book and she talks about drinking and sex and and are falling on the weekends and throwing up the same kind of nonsense\nThat most young people I didn't but many maybe as many young people across America\nSaid it\nYeah so I don't know look Corey something's happening\nOr education system is spinning out kids that when you say the word illegal immigrants here immigrants spitting out kids when you say I Want proof they say well you don't believe any victim no ... what's missing what can we do where where's the ...\n... what was the fact that for for a nice ... and this and this is a part of a Fifteen or Twenty years ago where a lot of people in the day after a trade it not only\nEver try and get the the the show Hollywood they infiltrate into our school systems Catholic school systems now that's starting to see in Texas and they also have anti trade it I'm\nA law enforcement so that's why exactly while the things the way we're experiencing that way you experience because\n... and and we're going to continue to experience it until we start getting serious about doing thing about it until we do talk about as far as the candy and and also the people that don't educate you must know the history and how we got here\nAnd how to fix it you know a lot of course we we can always ask questions but we can't get\nAnswers as concrete that we can work with and that was what the problem is with issues because then\nWhen we were not being serious about it and this is a product that you see the fruits of you know you know it was chasing chasing a shadows stuff like that and try to like Hillary oh how about we start educating\nYoung people to stop their voter registration drive\n... teaching them liberalism and and everything else so a lot of conservatives\nThey're rock in the world of indoctrination in no time we're going to be back in just stuck on the

Baron find your bird for putting us on the air their\nNew Brunswick Dan is located in eastern New Jersey right between Philadelphia and New York city right on that line that goes up to the northeast part of the country and it's a ... New Brunswick his home of Rutgers University and also it's a home town of Robert Wood Johnson\nWho must be might know might not know him by name but in Eighteen eighty six in New Brunswick he founded the Johnson and Johnson company so I'm a boy and they're still look at it from my understanding corporate headquarters of the turned into a huge company it's run by\nA stunning because some of his sons and I think one of his sons are grandson per se grandson just my owns the New York jets football team I Believe is that right yeah and British it sounds it sounds like it worked out pretty good for I think I think those cue tips are doing real I guess that's the one that's not that's not really sure how that all happened [laughter]\nBut um I Would love to hear from everyone in the central New Jersey areas or give us a call a few of the home improvement question\nWell special hello to everybody there in New Brunswick and appreciate you certainly\nI'm listening to the show and you can reach out to us anytime one eight hundred non for six forty four twenty send us a message to days I'm honored dot com slash\nAsk right now want to let you know about October bean indoor air quality month there's such a big issue these days we worked so hard to seal up our homes really really well and we're trapping hot moist air and some contaminants inside not a problem but cause you're able to exhaust it properly\nBy of working with us at um today's homeowner here in uh sharing with you a lot of different ways that you can do it but here's another way we're celebrating with a great give away from our friends at Brown all month long Braun has given away and invent than ventilation fans\nThese decorative fans are very easy to install super quiet and even have a built in light or you have to do to win as to color hotlines make sure you leave your information on how we can talk cut contact you and say this little phrase I Need and invent\nA need and invent that one eight hundred non for six\nForty four twenty for your opportunity to win will be doing this ... month long and celebration of indoor air quality month because we just simply want to make you aware of what exactly nice to be done and can be done very easily to improve the air quality inside your home\nFor your whole family they Joe we got a lot of them got a lot of emails here let me go go to this one this one came from Michael in North Carolina and\nHad a lot of uh seems a little bit of a problem with Florence Hurricane Florence costs so much flooding out there and you know all our listeners and friends there in North Carolina and Virginia Tennessee area\nAnd a lot of it really did have a lot of problems and you're you're dealing with the aftermath of that and we certainly have been thinking about you hear on today's homeowner and hope that we can help you in any way we can we been posting a lot of articles on today's homeowner dot com of things that you need to think about as you're returning home we want to do everything we\nPossibly can but Michael Wright sand Joe says understand the whole concept about around\nThe house with the wheat poles and the brick but it seems to have backfired on us recently by this recent hit with Hurricane Florence the backside of our house was completely saturated and a lake formed in the cricket area behind our fireplace the we polls are located directly above\nThe roof on let me see here\nI think he probably has a whole nother wall that extends up past oh yeah I mean you know so the\nYeah ... ... ... is so it's above the refunding flashing on top of the cricket area if we had not been there the excess water that late into that cricket area would have come into the first level of the home\nFortunately I knew how to cut through the drywall an access that area and put buckets in place to capture the lakes so now we're looking for a solution to avoid the situation in the future\nHow to better seal off this area should another intense rainstorm\nPass through the windows are there for a reason row would be your advice on that for Michael\n... first for people are familiar we're we're using the term cricket era of cricket is simply a flashing that's put up behind a ordinarily a chimney to direct that water is coming down the route from just running right into the gym and it's like a little roof shaped piece of metal flashing just to divert water but in any case [noise] yeah the\nIt's like a little roof shaped piece of metal flashing just to divert water but in any case yeah the um unfortunately from Michael these we polls are not designed to move an intense amount of water we polls are putting brick homes to allow just condensation some moisture to\nOr if it forms inside the wall away to drop out there usually high up on the wall and low on the wall and you know build up of moisture will drop out but when they're not designed to keep back or hurricane so there's really not much you can do some people think oh well this deal we ... we pose yeah that's great when there's a hurricane but what happens you know the other shows in\n... right so\nI'm I'm not sure what I could tell them I wouldn't obviously would never recommend ceiling up we polls and I think you just have to um you know realize that these are not designed to prevent water infiltration from a hurricane only just normal moisture\nSure at one of the things is the the phone back or ride may not solve the entire problem but temporarily but using some of the three quarter inch I'm Around\nBack or ride that is a a phone type material that you used to fill in larger areas that need to be caught prior to ... but you could put that in and I'm just kind of Pakistan there and then after the storm take needle most fliers and pull it out\nThat might restrict some of the water from going in there but I forgot to you know that that that that might help a little bit but that is one of those unusual scenarios and I I Would like to say Joe maybe that's the thing we need to start working on our invention to figure out how to\nSome kind of temporary we poll filler because we get a few calls like that from time to the ... poll filler yeah yeah and those were able to go after work on that when there and\nThen see what kind of jingle we can put along with that one [laughter] okay let's go to the email secular again with I'm a Mary from Minneapolis says Hi guys we really love your radio show my nine year old mom came to live with this recently\nAnd we have to make a few changes to our homes to accommodate her in the bathroom we installed a few safety grab bars but she still needs some help getting in and out of the TBI have any suggestions thank you so much a grab bars very very important you but I'll tell you those walk in tubs I'm seeing those sayings advertise everywhere\nAnd so many people are realizing the benefits of those that\nThey fit into a traditional five foot um tub space um have you had much experience with those jokes\nYeah I've I've not um installed any but I Know that um they are becoming more and more popular in the prices come down a little bit you know as as um more and more homeowners are moving you know becoming multigenerational households but those walk in terms of still relatively expensive costs in between two and four grand\nOn but they would solve the problem in this case um you know it's one sure way to solve the problem\nAnd there's ... there's also a lot of a at a medical supply places I ... you know my my brother was a quadriplegic some moving you know people around them and different things there's amazing amount of fall lips\nHum you might even relate it to something that the kind of an odd comparison but something you would lift an engine out of a car is a little hydraulic type thing that they're made very very small\nAnd has a a kind of a ... kind of a co author nylon type of I'm almost ... like a device on it like a ... that's what I was trying to say and so there's a lot of those things that are also available to make that safe and easy to get in and out of the tub but the walk into probably is one of the better ways to go on that\nI also wanted to mention that they do make 'em depending married in mentioned how you know\nUm difficult it is for her mom to get enough but they do make a thing called the tub transfer seat which is a law invents that kind of straddles the edge of the tub so\nWhat a person can do is they sit on the bench than you lift one foot over the edge of the jobs and the other one and they slide over and they're still in the tub and then they can stand up so and they do make safety stainless steel safety grab bars the amount right to the edge in a town that's another option so he um I Would start with that\nAnd then depending on um our mom can handle that then maybe you know you may have to eventually move to step in Tom\nSawyer and Nicole when you hear these days about\nUm parents so you know growing old like that and the aging in place scenarios of trying to adapt your home so that people can\nContinue the living in the place that they are most comfortable with her we have a lot of information on our website about hum aging in place and some of the things you might need to do to make it comfortable and safe for your elderly parents and you're listening to your days home on a radio when we come

on my radio show\nAnd king ... nice to meet you\nGood good what can we help you with us here are pondering a little uh architectural change tell us about it\nWell actually at the front porch on on the phone and currently man and it has guns past ... those are four or five years okay and I I just find\nI really kind of line and ... and we have on like a saint John's sailing and die down but I prefer to have some more training sure sure\nHow I was wondering what you what bracket man can do I like to take the strength of why I don't mean that was my friend and ally okay I'm In the back and make it let me just Marr Marr Marr Marr like just a nice house in parks or what would you recommend in\nA while the openness certainly is nice and uh the questionable thing would be is is the four by four in the middle part of it is even needed\nBecause most likely when the original house was built um it probably wasn't screened in necessarily most or or that way so if you move the screen door you remove the the screen\nI Would guess you would be able to remove um\nThe the four by four in the middle but now the ... on the corners do you also have four by force\nI call ... style mhm because where we are and I'm just ... some of the house and every time I've done that when when just yesterday I I I like that and again and I don't blame down as far back on corners now\nBecause once you can do is you certainly can remove those and replace those with a variety of different columns that question\nIs you certainly can remove those and replace those with a variety of different columns that question would be\nYou know whether um architecturally it would be good to have square columns or round columns\nUm ... you know with a square column you can really use a four by four and just case around it\nWith one by sixes and then add some decorative molding around and you have a great looking where nice southern looking um column 'em or you can actually wrap they also have some that are aluminum as well as composite that can um\nIn case the four by four as well so that you still have the string\nBut you just you know looking at the the aesthetics of the outside of it\nUm it is something that I'm Home Depot has a lot of selections on those kind of things that you could take a look at an industry or certainly you know look you know and wanted to get some inspiration on the different types of columns that you have a lot of different um options air but my my hunch would be\nThat a square column would be more appropriate for the salt house it is\nOK okay Monique yeah\nI have another suggestion is that okay so product specifically for this\nKind of remodeling they're called the ... a couple of different names ... ... split columns ha ha or column covers or columns surrounds and they're actually um columns in either made on a fiberglass would aluminum PVC um there's some polymer stone ones that kind of like\nUm it's manufactured stones that real stone that kind of looks like don't square around but they're made to go round than existing post and they're they and they also make structural ones but that are single piece that would mean removing whatever post you out there so I I brought I agree I agree with Danny I think you remove the center of post\nPut these columns that you can slip right around which they're whatever posts are in the corner\nAnd corners removed the screens and then you can just take these split columns and wrap them around and they look great you know that's seen becomes almost invisible where the two pieces come together form ...

because he rises and you've got the ceiling up there you're going to have a warmer second floor so how do you combat that well there's a couple of things\nOne of which is you have ceiling fans up there right in the ceiling fans are not helping the pushing the warm air down so that it can be cold in the summer\nIt\nOne of the things you might want to do is considering supplementing the second floor with a split the closest to him and his foot Douglas\nIt's usually easier to do that then to overrun the ... the main air conditioner to get the second floor cooler\nIn the long run you use less energy that way sometimes in in a in the depending on the home designed you're going to get a warm area of the house that just can't get enough air delivered to it because of its design\nYou know in

develop each one\nIn today's episode where kicking things off with a look at the self awareness component of ... stick with us for the hour for that conversation the first one that you enjoyed our internal music and if you're dead checkout brother brother they are a two man in the American a band comprised of brothers badly and Brad Anderson\nBrother brother is the sound of pot parenting and we encourage you to go check them out at brother brother music dot com if for any reason you have to go before the show is that he started a head over to Jenny and Jodie dot com and drop us the line and we will gladly help you catch up on anything that you math\nOkay so this is one of my favorite topics we're talking again mind not yours no\nMine but went to ... how are you saying about that\n[laughter] well 'cause that's what we're going to talk about right now yes you were talking about step one I mean I don't know that there are necessarily stopped but the first thing that makes sense to us to talk about when we're talking about self awareness\nAnd building so foreign ... kids is helping them to identify what they're feeling and it's something that we can do from the time they're infants\nI what they're feeling and it's something that we can do\nFrom the time they're infants ... way before they develop language I'm as part of that development of language process\nSo here's an example you've got you know a six month old she's sitting on the floor and she's got this little blocks and obviously she is she can't\nPut this the square block in the square hole like that's the way to advance loser she's trying desperately to shove it into this round hole by hand this problem [laughter] I'm getting I think most people do everybody tries out of a square peg in around them time to die and then we will do with the baby does they go out and they throw in a primary right\nSo the bomb comes in and the mom says I'm you're feeling frustrated now that's a wonderful does not know what she said but when she gets down she says you're feeling frustrated that's okay let me help you and then she puts the\nThe little block in the correct whole with the babies hand on the block and she lets go and she says\nYou know it's actually no different than when you're a baby cries and you know they're hungry and you say let me get you a bottle or ... or mommy will you to come right with mom it's it's you're identifying what's happening and you're given a name to it that's it and so that\nThe Internet access dot com\nTime to protect your online

E. N. N. Y. A. N. D.\nJ. O. D. Y. dot com [noise] welcome back to ... parents your union and we're getting off the theories today on helping kids become\nEmotionally intelligent and in today's episode we are talking about raising self\nAwareness in the first thing that we talked about teaching kids to identify and interpret they're feeling so if you missed part of the show because you're just tuning in or if you're for any reason you have to go before the show is that be sure to head over to Jenny in Jody dot com that's Jenny with an eye\nAnd Jodie with ally and drop it on the line we will gladly help you catch up on anything that you met now in this segment we're going to take a look at how and why to avoid ... emotions\nAs either good or bad and I don't think we realize we do this sometimes yeah and we'll go through a list of the ones that I recall bad\nAnd talk about why we can't we can't do that but at first\nYou know to ... I think one of the biggest um I openers for us was a while back we were reading an article\nAnd in the article it talked about how when we assign a value Judgement\nTo emotions into situations it can actually increase our intelligence not decrease our intelligence decrease in my yard makes it actually makes a lot of ... and I'll tell you what we don't we don't realize and one of the one of the things that that we see and I'll tell you I'm from the Midwest\nAnd just runs rampant in there and I'm not beating up on the mid west people but it's just something that that is the culture there yeah that when a child does something when they misbehave\nIt's like they oh that could bad that's bad and it's not even necessarily they said that kid that they'll say that bad\nAnd the death labeling that right and and when we do that I think the reason I think you know cause I'm so smart [laughter] or by the shore if I'm not sure but I I I my thought on this is the reason that it decreases our intelligence or one of the reasons is because\nIt shuts down our thinking no it that's what it says it shut down you're critical thinking and you're no longer ... as a ... um yeah we're not going to think about that bad you shut it down and you don't is that analyze what's happening to create\nCoping mechanisms or another way to to change that behavior archery um direct yeah I Love this show that you found this this says Psychology Today from Psychology Today\nPerhaps the biggest problem with labels occur as when past ... emotional reactions leads to pills in other words we say the emotion that you're experiencing right now sadness worry yeah anxiety I\nReally should be medicated we can give you a panel\nThat will take it away you know listen I'm not saying that there are not circumstances where there are people who have chemical imbalance that they need balanced out that there's something that they had that that is not just emotional right there is a physiological component\nThat needs to be managed in order for the emotional component to be managed but when they're talking about in this article\nIs that we have taken emotions attached pathology which is sickness to emotion\nAnd now we're no longer using that emotion as the red flag that it should be figuring out what the problem is that following the ... and said let's not Mitt ticket bell [laughter] she'll tell me up\nTake a pill [laughter] ... la ... one of the things that I think we can do when our kids are experiencing what they might call a negative emotion they get mad at themselves because they feel something that they deem is negative\nAnd they tell us about it obviously there has to be a whole lot of conversation or we don't know what's going on inside of them and again this all starts with like we've sat in the first segment it has to start with labeling your emotions so they can tell you that that's going on but once they come to you and they say\nThey're experiencing as much than that and it's bad and they're mad about or they're upset about it one of the things we can teach them is that their brains are hard wired for gross\n[noise] so they don't have to be afraid\nOf an emotion that they think is negative because they can learn from that emotion and they can grow from that emotion and maybe right now they didn't have the most productive response to that situation but they can they can learn to and the emotions help them get their well and I think\nThat's the key you just said it is you can learn to grow in your emotional intelligence and I'll tell you what you know we this is my my favorite of all times and we talk all the time is the growth mindset in the book mindset by Carol D walk\nAnd I you know this is the growth mindset that's what that is it's the growth mindset and it's something that\nIf if if we don't aren't aware of that we're going to actually push on to our kids a fix mindset\nWhich tells them that you're just an angry person right [laughter] you just how you are ... yeah exactly and that's not you don't have to be that no nobody has to be that hey if you're just joining in this pop parenting with Jenny and Jodie and today we're talking about raising our kids self awareness\nAs part of a bigger topic that recovering in the month of October ... of emotional intelligence so we've had some experiences in our own families you know we had girls\nOlder girls who were raised together and then we've had younger babies were raised together and there can be a temptation to you look at a behavior and labels that behavior as good or bad so like\nUm there was a time where I'm One of our babies are pushed another baby and a little dolls stroller and pushed her into a tree and and there was this thought process you know for a split second like oh that was bad right or she is a bad kid right but that's first of all is ridiculous they were a year and a half old\nOf all I'm it's the same thing with emotions you know like\nIf your emotions are not good or bad just like\nDo we want to teach the one and half year old oh honey we don't want to push her into the ... of course right we're not saying let them just hatched however and don't correct it right\nWe're just saying just like that behavior doesn't mean the one and a half year old a bad kid right right when you feel angry it doesn't mean that you have a bad emotion or your bad and I feel right let's let's talk about some emotions that people can interpret as bad 'cause you know what\nThe good emotions aren't the ones we have to worry about what do you know here's here's a big one guilt\nYeah are you know I've heard I've heard people say like\nYou know don't feel guilty you couldn't help it [laughter]\nOkay but if you do feel guilty [laughter] I'd probably tells you that there's something you can do there's a way you can make right ... right and maybe we own our own and make restitution when you ...\nAnd then and then you can move on maybe you need to learn self forgiveness if a child is feeling guilty about something maybe they haven't learned\nHow to forgive themselves before we can forgive ourselves we have to go through the steps\nRight that take us to that place what about we talked about jealousy I'm anger just tells us that there's a problem that we need to solve what self pity Mm\nYou know when someone is feeling self pity usually it's a it's a red flag but they need to work on their sense of self worth I\nThink people whose eyes the people who struggle a self pity they don't like to own that one\nYeah that one's hard with we start with their kids and we tell them that this is what they're feeling and it's a normal feeling I Believe I heard that we're just going to say you know what that tells me it tells me that\nYou feel like your knees aren't being met your out being heard right you are not being valued so let's let's get right into place where you can feel that contempt\nCan can can tell us that there's a break in the relationship that needs to be repair fix your face [laughter]\nYou've got some contempt on your face right now [laughter] talk about that [laughter]\nMy God we're going to head out to a break when we come back we're going to continue the conversation about helping kids raised their self awareness\nWith a look at some very common mistakes that here in making this process but actually make our kids somewhere in the long run you're listening to talk of parenting with Jenny and Jodie and we'll be back in just a moment\nThe United states of empire is a booster claims the United states is the empire of the world\nGeorge Washington had warned us against foreign wars the streets of empires shoes that\nWar is one and lifted Lindbergh is former calling us just said the\nWater was a river of those who do we fight for the deep state began with World War one for United States of empire dreams done I'll be a little at Amazon Books\nHealth care reform is confusing whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan your doctor or being able to afford needed prescription navigating the health care system has become a challenge to control your own health care costs and choices with liberty healthcare liberty healthcare in not insurance\nNo my God I wouldn't the airwaves would we because we you know we've read we've had a kid right when the two of us and now a grandchild yeah we've had a little we've had a bunch of mistakes on her are about them um my here's one how 'bout we've done this one big time for the kids to apologize when they're not sorry\nAnd you get the orange for a while now and then they turn into the ... the notes were like well I'm Sorry and then and then she was like what I Apologize freaking out [laughter] [laughter] well let's talk about that for a minute I'm\nJodie you said this before you said really the key in that situation you don't and we don't want our kids to apologize but we want to help them to feel empathy so that they can actually feel\nI something dawned on me recently like the words sorry and the words sorrow are a lot of light so good and in order to really be sorry there has to be a strong element of sorrow right and the person who hurt the other person like you have to feel sad right for what you die and then you can say I'm Sorry\nAnd they can ask for forgiveness and they can be genuine heal the relationship right and that's really what we want for our kids anyway I just went on a totally different other when making kids clear their plate\nWho or eat when they're not hungry that that does sound ... yeah ... kids can't send\nRight when they are hungry and not have retired or not tired like we need to teach our kids to listen to their bodies right yeah now let's first surgeon Jody about the opposite side of the coin oh my goodness\nHow about because we are talking about software to it's not just emotional software and it's like\nOkay American Idol has that whole opening show where you watch the people get up there who cannot sing but I've been told their whole life that they're the next barbers try that [laughter] I\nThought you were getting when you were talking about this until I was like no they're on their purpose right now what they really ain't that they can I mean I went\nTo a real waste auditioned out and I will tell you there were only two people in the entire room that we were and there was about I don't know Fifteen people in the room we were in actually auditioning at that moment and other fifty people only two of them could really say while\nAnd it's yeah exactly when we have the whole story about this you have so as a parent so we don't want to cross our kids were not trying to be mean to them we need to speak with compassion and love but in our quick little story are girls are not the answer no let's together a dancer ts and it was adorable\nBut it was not competition well so we said did you have they said yeah we said greens 'cause you're

asking a question can a\nPerson change can someone actually honestly make big changes in their life you know then we hear about how well a leopard\nCan't change its spots about is ... can't change its stripes but does that mean that we as people can't change I'd have to argue with that\nYou know I find often times people come into my office and they tell me that they believe that people cannot change that they can't change is not in their nature but again I argue with that because I Believe that people can make changes in their life\nLasting changes that work and last a lifetime but it's up to that person to actually make that change stick\nYou know I find that interesting because changes such a thing you know we talk about how they've changed her she's changed her she told me she changed I'm going to get back into the relationship and this is going to be so amazing because of all the changes being made\nBut you know we really want to look at change and we really want to discuss change how much change is real what's the length of time for change\nWhat's the length of time of change to stick and to to be steady and consistent and how do you know someone's really changed\nI mean I think that's one of the big question is how do you really know if someone's really changed\nIn my office I have folks that come in and they're having marital issues relationship issues and they take a little time off and the first thing when they come in years I think they changed they told me they change you've made all these changes in my first response to that is it's not a negative response\nBut my first response to that is an awareness type response\nMaking the persona where the fact that changed takes time\nOkay changes not instantaneous changes not overnight change takes time\nAnd when we think about that and we're real with that we become more realistic about what somebody can honestly change\nIn their life\nYou know I had done some change in my life when it comes to the core though when it comes to the core of my dean how I was when I was a kid\nI think I'm more like that and I think that we began our life a certain way I think most of us began our life\nAnd loving and happy way but it's the environment and the impact of the dynamic of the family dynamic is the unhealthy upbringing and you know it it's all that that goes into creating walls and division and fear\nAnd anxiety and depression and all those different things that happen when we are exposed to certain things that aren't good or healthy for us and I feel that when prior to that\nGood are healthy for us and I feel that when ... prior to that exposure consistent exposure I think for the most part many of us for pretty happy and healthy children we're pretty happy and healthy and I feel that often times\nWe have to go through years and years of pain and suffering and we go through those years and then eventually as we work through with a therapist or a life coach

prospect\nWelcome back live coverage you liked protected minor host asked her\nToday show I'm asking the question can a person truly change [noise]\nCan someone actually change\nAnd change for the good and changed forever okay you know often times we see somebody that's changed quote and quote and within a few months they change back right or the talk of the changes all\nThis talk but it really really wasn't change in reality it was just somebody trying to get back into your life or a spouse trying to move back in a girlfriend or boyfriend try and do you explain that yes they cheated but they've learned and they've gotten better and they've changed for the good and take them back because they've done all this work\nAnd now they just want you to take them back because they change I've changed okay\nSo let's talk about that can a person really change and right\nBefore the break I was talking about my rule my belief and I have a rule and I call that the\nTen year change rural the ten year rule in order for somebody to really really change [noise] okay and I'm\nA big believer in this you had to literally gone ten years not doing what you were doing that was so negative or\nSo uh you know self clothing or or whatever that was\nAnd I find that very interesting I Know some people go out ten years\nTen years a long time and I really do think ten years I mean some people might go seven years 'cause that's as long as the IRS goes back on your taxes right\nBut I think seven to ten years and I really believe in a ten year rule because when somebody has really made a change so let me give an example and somebody has gone through rehab for drugs and alcohol\nLives so overly okay you know being a band to accountability meetings done all that stuff you know spoken with groups been there to help other people I Believe that someone that's been sober for ten years had is sober and we'll Be Sober\nYes could something happen to that person in their lives could there come the death of somebody or or a deep depression sure but for the most part I think that ten years specify that this person has learned from the situation they have moved on and they had changed your life\nYou know when people ask of criminals can be you know it if they can if they can change their life and and you know what can they do and when do you believe that somebody has actually changed your life for the better well I Believe if somebody wants to jail and did the time it came out\nAnd you're talking about rehabilitation I think it's easy because it's it's easier to go back to a life of crime because it's what you know\nOkay and I think this is a good example\n[noise] so in order to not go back to a life of crime there's a lot of things that has to be done you have to change your entire people places things you've got to change that people you spend time with you got to change the places you go you got to change the things you do you got to change your\nWhole lifestyle it's a lot like with drugs and alcohol when somebody's addicted to drugs or alcohol they go through the rehab process you know nowhere in rehab and nowhere and sober living\nRehab process you know nowhere in rehab and nowhere and sober living does anybody say okay when you get outta here you go back to the same place you are out you hang out with the same people you did drugs with and you'll be fine nobody says that okay\n'cause you can't because it's hard to change is hard enough to make real change significant change life altering change and be around other people that haven't changed\nOkay I mean remember what I just said that's powerful stuff\nYou can't expect to change and change your life and and and literally make these huge life changes\nAnd be around people that haven't changed that are still living in the same lifestyle and you think you're going to get off scot free and nothing's going to come to you I mean that's almost impossible people say that you're like the the five people you hang out the most interesting stuff there and think about the five people you hang out the most who are they\nOkay for the most part it's me myself and I I don't know you know just kidding but seriously\nSeriously you can expect to change when you're around an environment in around people that haven't changed because almost impossible you have to make a lifestyle change and what that lifestyle change that's real change and it takes real work and takes real dedication it takes overcoming once fear\nAnd so many people don't choose to change because they don't want to actually do the work\nThey're scared to do the work or they're fearful what's going to happen or they're fearful the future they don't know how they're going to be or they don't know how they're going to look at I don't know how everything's going to work out and so they go back to the old routine because that's what they know\nI mean how many of you've gotten back in old relationships romantic relationships that didn't work in the first place and now you're back in it again\nBecause you know you got fearful living alone you didn't want to be by yourself you get back in ... and it's even worse than it was before\nAnd she there hasn't changed it or it's worse and you went back to it because of why because of fear because fear takes over in our life and it pushes us back into the old ways of doing things fears are very interesting thing because fear makes us do things that are just\nIdiotic\nI have a good example of how fear can make us do things that literally just are not intelligent\nI was recently on a trip in a in a lady that I Know I was driving me and she has a a driving service a car service for a short car service and she was telling me she was our forgot to tell you she goes the other day I picked up this lady at eight thirty in the morning and\nShe needed to go work and she goes and I was hall and I was trying to go as fast as I could\nAnd so she was driving now this is in Los Angeles and and you know anywhere in the big see nowadays traffic is a huge deal traffic is big and if you're needed to leave for work and you're in a huge city and you're having to take the highway you need to leave a lot or earlier than thirty minutes at a time so anyway says you driving this lady\nThere on the highway and she's going to exit off and use the ways program to try to get there faster\nUm to try to you know to cut down some of the time and the lady was like hey I'm I'm late for work I'm going to be late for work I'm stressed out and the lady was scare that she's going to lose a job because obviously he was in the first time that she was late for gay not the first time and she was kind of panicking a little stressed out and\nAnd the lady that I Know that was Dr and said you know we keep it together I'm going to get there as fast as I can I'm an extra right now and I'm going to go down the street and that street and will be there and in five to seven minutes um it's only like you know\nTwo miles down the road\n[noise] she accepts the highway at the red light about to make the right and the woman literally opens the passenger door grabs her briefcase and goes on out here it taken so long I Want to be so late for going to lose my job slams adore kicked the door and and starts walking down the street and this woman has another two miles to go\nTo miles to get to work with a briefcase and heels rush hour traffic two miles it's going to take her at least twenty four minutes to get there when it would've taken five to seven minutes by car\nNow you see how fear gotten the way of making an intelligent decision well that's what often happens to us and we're fear of the unknown fear of the things that we've never try fear of the change fear of being alone all this stuff is very interesting because it all goes together\nWhen it comes to relationships and happiness and gratitude and nothing can be compartmentalized by the way nothing\nEverything has to work together everything has to streamline everything is connected directly connected\nAnd real change takes work and dedication\nAnd I find that very interesting and I and I find it I find it highly important to understand because I think that oftentimes when people think about change their normally changing or they're they're talking about the change because somebody in their life is unhappy with them\nFind that most people are somewhere kind of in the middle okay and is very different shades of grey black and white there's different shades of good bad indifferent but the interesting part of that the interesting part of that is the fact that we don't know the difference for young\nWe don't know the difference because we're just around and we assume that everybody has a we as soon as normal it's our normal even though it's are unhealthy do you get what I'm saying and I think that's very powerful\nAnd I think that when we become more mindful in our life and realize from tragedy ... from our past overcome that type of diversity we began to realize is the the avenues of how we can make better decisions\nAnd how we can regulate our emotions better not fly off the handle not freak out and not go into a rage go on a road rage go on an anger fear all that stuff to be able to calm down and sell shoes and make those\nBetter decisions too powerful\nAnd we begin to make better decisions and decisions that are not self harming indices that don't harm other people and we begin to regulate our emotions and realize where are these emotions are coming from an understand ourselves\nWe begin to be very powerful people in a very amazing positive clean way and and that clean way we're able to make the changes in our life that we need and were able to be aware of things that we need\nTo change and and it's interesting\nIn that it's so interesting so powerful because I found that the closer you get to who you are the more you can see little changes that need to be made and the more valuable that becomes and the quicker the changes can be made because we're not so much that needs to be done\nAnd it's a very powerful position and sometimes you might get down on your show of you might get upset you might get fearful but I ask you at those times to step back and ask yourself why am I getting fearful why am I getting down on myself why am I internalizing this because this is taking me off course is Katie me out of my mindfulness is taking me out of the moment right\nIt's putting me back into the passwords putting me in the future of the unknown and all these things are scary\nBecause for many of us we may many decisions in our past that we're not positive we made decisions in our past that were negative we made decisions in our past that hurt us you know a good example of somebody choosing to get married and\nHaving to go through the divorce process of looking back and saying gosh what was going on in my head why did I Do this I Can't believe this you know if I could get duped into those that can be due to anything I I Can't even trust myself I mean what do I think that I can make this change when I couldn't even simply do this and you see how that negative self talk just ...\nOver over takes you into the position of well what inability to make decisions the fear scared\nThe self questioning and and self ridicule that puts you in a downward spiral all these things that take you out of the power position and make you a question yourself\nYou know I find it very interesting when you stand when you look at the common themes and and spiritual practices throughout our country and every country and throughout history of our time you know there's a belief that we as humans\nCan raise our awareness our conscious awareness\nAnd that we can raise our awareness and by doing that we can live a life at a higher more fulfilling more fulfilled level and I believe that the Wii wholeheartedly true\nAnd so that's why I Believe again that people can change because I Believe that we can change at ... that's that's a common theme throughout life and you know if you look at a movie if you look at\nThe protagonist the anti because you look at all this stuff and you look at how you know the hero has got to go through this trial and tribulation and they have to make some personal changes and they have to overcome this and they have to overcome this and they have to go over this and that and you know overcoming adversity and overcoming their own personal challenges and doing all that and then getting to that next level and succeeding\nIn order to succeed the person had to make changes\nHad to deal with adversity differently had to overcome the self lower than the self esteem issues of self worth as you had to go inside and\nTackle those demons and turn around and make things work but how the person not a change had the person not seen that they had to change or need to change and what will happen\nThe same thing same stance\nThe same status quo nothing changes life continues going on the same way every time I ever see comes Powell persons down again pow pow pow eventually that goes into some sort of depression ... or the person keep sane other people are doing this to me and not taking responsibility for what they can change\nBecause a lot of times often when we don't want to take that responsibility when we see it as everybody else as we see that because we don't want to change the fear of of not wanting to change\nOr the the fear of all the work that will have to be done to make that change\nAnd I and I feel that when you're ready to make these changes\nIt comes to you very quickly and maybe it hasn't really been quite maybe it's been a period of several years or a lifetime but when you finally do realize the need for the change it almost feels overnight that you got to make that change\nYou know there's so many you've made some major changes where you've quit smoking quit drinking you've gotten out of abusive relationships right\nYou stop beating yourself up mentally and emotionally you got out of an abusive physically abusive mentally abusive marriage relationship and you moved on and you realize the cycle that you were in and you realize the cycle urine before that in the cycle before that in a cycle of war that\nAny work to rectify the situation isn't to figure out what brought you ended the cycles and what was within you that puts you into those relationships because it's not a one sided street it takes two people to tango right\nWhen I

and he was kind of the fire started on our fence for the organized in his plate you'll see a very talented young man of fit your senior number three Sam Vaughn he is the University of Georgia transfer or he was on the scout team\nEm Vaughn he is the University of Georgia transfer he was on the scout team for the bulldogs and then transferred over here to West Florida for his last year a football really good quarterback leads the Gulf down copper to fourteen hundred and seven yards passing averaging two hundred and eighty one yards per game\nI mean he's just a talented thrower he's got a cannon foreign arm or we watched them film on him or he can scramble over a little bit too mostly a pocket passer\nBut he's not afraid to pull the football down an a scramble out if he has to either very towns a young man and he's been around football for a long time he knows the game and he throws about ten different wide receivers you look at the too deep and they have a great mix of science a great mix of speed\nTry to have scrimmage is you know friday's of every home game you know and kind of let those guys get out there and and you know turn it loose and play full speed so yeah you know we're always monitoring those guys and you know seeing seeing how they're doing sometimes it can be quite an adjustment you know coming from\nYou know being a a two or three years starter and high school to coming over here now you know you're not on the travel squad you're on the scout team so we do you know try to do a good\nJob of of keeping an eye on them and you know really excited about our group um ... you know continue to have you know great\nEffort you know on on the practice field in scouting but also in the classroom you know it's important for those guys to get off the good so that I'm In in school so I'm you know anxious ready to see 'em in spring and you know it's gonna be a good group\nI coach let's talk about West Florida now it's a match up at the last two division to runners up UNH twenty sixteen national runner up west supported the twenty Seventy national runner up let's start with the quarterback position my boat drew their starter game one and it took him in the national championship game last year goes down their backup Sam von a transfer from\nGeorgia is a Skelton quarterback at George has done a nice job of it as his replacement less painful a games what do you expect to see today at the quarterback position well we're we're going in like\nNumber three is going to play you know he's he's come in you know obviously you know just\nA very good player there um you know both those guys you know obviously last year you know the great years of great great run they got on at the end so you know quarterback position is not a not a problem for them so you know we we look for the bond kid to play but you know it wouldn't surprise us at this point in the year if\nIt if you know the year started came back to\nAnd it looks like it'll be working with several talented skill position guys are starting at the wide receiver looks like he has several weapons\nNo doubt you know I mean he's he's that there are very deep group um they've got linked they they can run they catch the ball well they\nDo a good job you know within their routes and timing with the quarterback so you know obviously there are team that likes to stretch the ball down the field vertically they're really good in the past in game but you know to me you know we've got to do a good job on the run you know I mean I think um\nYou know Chris shorts they're running back you know it's a really good downhill run reruns hard with great pad level so you know we've got to do a good job you know stopped in the inside zone doing a good job on the quarter back in the running

I don't think there's really anything wrong he's doing you know I think obviously there's times you want to make a few toes here and there but nobody's perfect you know and\nUm you know as a coach you know you love the way he stands on the pocket you love the way he steps into throws and he's taken a lot of hits this year and made some really big time place so as a coach or power the way you see 'em fight he take shots gets back up and does it again in as a coach that's all you can ask for and\nI'm really proud of the way he's come and compete every game and you know especially after a week to getting a little banged up you know you don't ever see him complain or a mope around he's out there encouraging his guys and\nAnd as a coach that's all you can ask for so I've been really pleased and um you know numbers numbers are numbers you know I think the big thing for us was the one last call them you know and obviously keeping turnovers minimum and so\nThe overall big thing for us um that that Christian knows and our quarterbacks and as we ask touchdowns we'll find ways to put the ball in the end zone and um we're doing a really good job and so we get there and so unless the coaching staff or going to do much better job of having preparation and and this week we feel really good about it\nI was talking about the running back Damon Cox back to back Ninety yard to ball games Ninety five against Campbell Ninety One of the week before against ... Pacific damons been great all season but this off its of lying out of the running backs how badly they want to get a hundred yard Russia right now\nThat they tell me all the time so um but you know that's a tribute to the both groups there um and really it's also a tribute to those White House in ... you know a lot of times those titans get overlooked but\nYou look up and how you pulled out a win on the road of southern Utah you had to kick of it I mean I'm thirty eight yard field goal to be the zoo's a Pacific had to come from behind and Alabama and am\nSo at the end of the day I mean I Can't complain about a three and who's you know start um we lost two games on a North Dakota state who still number one team in the country and ah well the better football team and then we lost a Campbell and uh you know that was just a bad start well I don't know sometimes you go back and you kind of re look at things and\nYou know we made a lot of mistakes but the end of the day I got to give credit to gamble so you know yeah I mean right now to be three into or you can some people might say you're very fortunate to be three and I will take three into not complain about it more on Campbell and\nJust one second you know Jim Hodges gave us a note this week there's one hundred twenty five MCS football schools and right now you and it has been heights tough is scheduled in the nation you you share that sort of information with the team\nI Do I don't want to dwell on it you know uh uh you you but you want to know they're playing really good competition I mean if there's a hundred and twenty five ... played football and we're in our first year transition and we've already got the nine toughest schedule\nYeah I think that's something they do need to be alerted by you know we have played some good football teams and I don't get no easier uh West Florida are really good football team ranked eleventh in the country in the world vision to I let's\nTalk about Campbell just a little bit coach the camel scored three touchdowns on their first for possessions of safety helped him take a twenty three to nothing lead the rest of the way that we played than to seven to seven tie or what can you say about the game\nWell I you know I don't know what happened to the very first the game I'm just I didn't see much intensity we didn't come out ready to go and that falls back on the coaches I mean we've got to have ourselves we as coach has got to have them ready to go [noise]\nFootball strange sometimes you see these things occur teams have this happen a lot of times sometimes you're able to come back from there and you've got three quarters and do that\nPlayed better throughout the night but not you know we just dug herself to big it was kind of like North Dakota state um you're getting too big oh and you can't get out of it against a good football team like Campbell in North Dakota state you're not going to make a comeback and uh\nYou know there are good enough to keep you down and\nYou know or you know ... is in some ways it looks like maybe we were dragging a little bit could be a little you know fatigue sitting in them but you know a lot of things around the country you know play four five six games where you have about ... and our schedule it you know our bottle come for another three weeks we you know and that's just part of it um it's not no excuses just\nAs football's a ground you've got to be able to adapt to it and you can get through it in something we're going to deal with moving forward will be playing more football games and the future I think next year with like twelve\nA year after that eleven so I Would have been eleven this year and you know obviously the game got cancelled but\nYou know we're okay ... you know we're in good we're in a good place we haven't played it as well in the last two weeks as we would like to play but\nUm you know I didn't have a special downwind from all of this year I'm On and so right now we're three into and we're in a good place got five games laugh got back to back home games and we can we'll all went off the next five would have a great season eight and two would I'd I'd love to have that\nGoes the first four games this season the fence was perfect in the red zone against Campbell I Believe it was three total red zone tries one touched down to turnover is not something we've seen a lot of from the office of unit so far this year how do you clean up mistakes like that\nWhat we've addressed it in um one thing we're trying to do with our players is keeping more engaged and you get in such a routine around here that what a Sunday is like and what a Monday man often and you come over here to you is the same meetings in practice you got to change up practice you got to kind of change that what you do uh we've we've really push the issue about\nComing over watching more film on your own and we want to see more over here\nDon't just take what would you be in the meetings in practice do the extra put in extra time\nYou know as coaches we're up here all night and we want to see the players not necessarily be up your online but come over to put in extra time when you don't have class and\nShow us that it is in your your engaged in his main something this is hard sometimes when you're not playing for anything and there's no postseason so motivation thing kind of to me is starting to sit in a little bit and we're trying to find ways to reach 'em and so\nYou know uh you know one thing we want to do this years maybe on the team with rain in the first ever division one team\nBut also you want to put you know seven eight wins on there I don't want to put five or six so we're trying to motivate yourself to get to that point\nUm you know just we just got to keep working his is working but we all know this is the next four years to come and we've got to work through it until we're able to play for postseason\nGoats you look at the defense of effort from Campbell most of Campbell's production came in the first quarter second third and fourth quarter is the the defense really settled in this deep into the hallway it's been a strange here for them lots of talent\nOn that side of the football they'd given up some yards and it's a big place but how do you keep them from getting too discouraged 'cause I think when you look past the paper they are very talented unit\nYeah I just think this year where we've we've kind of struggled as we missed a little bit uh we thought in the second area that we would be a little bit better\nUm it goes back to this though you're good players have got to play good if they're not playing good and it's a struggle Chris has not had the best started this season hasn't had a bad year he just hasn't had the year that he had last year and so\nA lot of people feed off of him in a he's not played well we haven't played well at the core um but I think a lot of that has to do with the polish we'd go up against were mismanaged and we're going to have to recruit links in the future there and we knew that going into the yes but\nA good thing about the second ... we've got death than we're able to roll people in and out to try to figure out who can do it and so\nWe just got to keep battling a we end of the day there's some things like ... we got to get better end eventually got to get better and even in special teams and\nUh we were wearing a good place to think right now the eventually we just got to got to do a better job in the past\nI today it's West Florida the runner up last year in division two and just their third year playing football coach or the ... this season undefeated or no season they have one last on the season for and won overall but what do they look\nLike right now but it looked like a really good football team to me that it's got a chance to win the go south commerce and make a splash in the playoffs and do they battled a few injuries and going through some things but uh\nThey've done a great job there and they've got things role and they're going to be a team to contain within the world division two and um [noise] you know this is going to be a tough game I Would say in auto at everybody always wants me to kind of give me a thoughts on how the rank these opponents you know I Would say North Dakota state one Campbell to\nSouthern Utah three and I've given ... Florida the fourth of his game on schedule without knowing at until we play I might say something different after the game but going into the game you know ten games on the schedule there in the top half of the you know straight to schedule ... very\nTalented quarterback in my ... but he went down in game one they've had the backup play the last handful of games any word on what you may see a quarterback\nAfternoon no I haven't really heard much I just do the quarterback has taken over done a great job and he's going for a lot of touchdown passes and he's a transfer and I don't think they've missed much of a ... I'm sure they may think differently 'cause I Know\nAnd they will transfer in adult like they've missed much of a ... I'm sure they might think differently because otherwise probably they're kept in the end of the day they they do a lot of good things and we're just go out to play and all three plays a British lay on the one that's game\nYou look at the west Florida defense and it looks like they have a lot of play makers on that side of the football what challenges do you see the off in space and\nWell the biggest thing over there just you know can we run the football and keep them older he got up off balance and they want to start down we've got to be able to complete mood to change or we need to kind of go back where it was a ... one in how we move the ball and so we just need to\nYou know when you should do to keep doing the things we're doing over there and protect the football and in ...\nAnd now my wallet coach for the next five at home or Brawley stadium but today it almost sort of feels like the home opener once again uh the rain delay lightning delay in the home opener against ... how nice will be to hopefully just to have a normal home game atmosphere\nOr no our players are looking forward to that and he was just so much easier when you're hearing your sleep in your own bed and then\nYou know the game kicks off its it's six then you get a whole you know nine thirty ten o'clock and you know if you go back all our games even the home game you know we've been getting in it\nOr the four o'clock in the mornings and so it's just good to know that we can actually be whole and and hopefully one of the game and enjoy ourselves and be with her family for come back to work all son to son who's ... for\nShort list that you were the best of luck this afternoon thinking about that unit head football coach Chris oil is we've got one more break when we come back we'll get set for kick off its north Alabama and West Florida getting set to go at it on the line sports network not about\nAghast at three has provided natural gas service to the kitty to Muscle Shoals in Madison and surrounding areas of Congress line from Lawrence in Madison County in Alabama for over forty years\nI don't that leads to do sometimes the current issue smelling ... who knows how they're possible tons and the gap ... immediately avoiding mission towards this morning from a political contest immediately 'cause I take three thirty three and six in ... county to buy six six eight five twenty five an hour wait in\nLines county and you'd think Kevin\nKevin his humor as his used ... down in Madison County north Alabama gas district we take the seriously\nHey lines fan it's un aid tailgating tae\nBo jangle ... football offers up chicken\nBiscuit and sides for every day and of course football tell game like eight pieces a page and fried chicken soup thing because I speak to court made from scratch buttermilk biscuits and bow jingles I teach for a big crowd there's the superhero games jingles even offers solace chicken was this the brains you know getting getting it with you a day is alliance\nDone come on those two guys are ball hawking linebackers north Alabama has taken the field to our right getting set to return purple hats purple jerseys white pants that kj Smith on the right casual it's Cortez\nHall overlap patch here come the art goes in their royal blue\nHelmets white jerseys with blue numbers blue pants as well I won't say West Florida with the royal blue and Kelly Greene colors two of my favorite color combo amp there I Will say that looks good but not as good as the good old political out there on the ... and the blues good but the purple better I can tell you that you're\nAll Senate Williams ... a six foot one hundred and Ninety pound a junior out of California has the ball on the left ... it's almost time to play football syrup Raleigh stadium it's West Florida kicking off north Alabama set to return\nAnd it's time to play football game number six\nUnderway Williams makes his approach the right footing kick is a line drive tick that will bounce it the Eighteen bounces off with kj Smith's right needs to step and he'd been down to pick it up at the numbers jokes back right\nUp to twenty yard line where he's finally tackle and the football might have come out west Florida is warning that they have the football the officials come racing am let's pause first station id when we come back we'll have the car [noise]\nUse talk sports Ninety seven one F.
