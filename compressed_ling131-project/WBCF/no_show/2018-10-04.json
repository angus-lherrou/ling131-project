could have been and then you've got the you know ... ... who's just tweeting about cabinet which makes no sense that's not fixing anything\nAnd then I think David is is a confused sold because one day he's boycotting people sponsors and the next day he's getting into college and doing just that the other\nAny thought to be ... you what we said for the beginning Joe their kids this is what kids do I agree with you but the left in this country the anti gun\nLeft in this country want it to save barely experts we have to listen to them any thoughts on how the progress since February\nSure there's a there's a couple of things I Want to talk to about it's easy for people to just blame the gun you know what I mean that that the easy route I could just anyone could just say it's the gun and not really look into really what happened and that's easy but getting back to the kids that I'd really like to tell you have a\nCamera in ... and ...\nThey came and they help in the campaign they actually came out in Broward to try and make a difference so\nThat they did come and help those to the ... the others I I don't know where they are you know I don't really but I Know Cameron Kane he reached out to me we met a couple of times camera that myself and he came out and helped us campaign he came to early voting so he really wanted to make a difference in Broward\nCounty I'm with you and I think that he's sort of had a realization that he does have the power\nAnd the social media strength that we used to make a difference and he stands back and says I don't know that I made the difference that I wanted to be others I think are are in their own world but but Cameron seems to have come around and they just happen to have a conversation with him about about what he seems to be seeing now\nWell he wants to take a look at both sides right oh ... oh so he's open minded to a meeting with\nBut with any side whoever wants to talk to him he'd open minded and that's what the world needs more people to sit down with someone who ... who has a different opinion themselves and work it out not someone that's just so one sided and that's what I think he came to he's gotten right\nIt is a Republican who lost his daughter metal at Parkland in Parkland, Florida there must be high school or indeed our schools safer today than they were in February\n... they were in a safe they're safer because they had more armed guards but could anyone get into the school at anytime they want yes you know anyone's going to be able to walk in with a knife a hatch it a pipe bomb until we rarely secure the schools and I think it's gonna take metal detectors I don't know how many years it's going to take\nBut that's the only way that we're going to guarantee our kids and our teachers safe inside of schools but what I don't think we're there yet\nWhy won't be hard and the schools what's the problem with with making it one way you one way out at least in the morning in the afternoon and 'cause I don't know what if you get into a stairwell nobody can get into a back door nobody can be no one could hide a gun to the bathroom and come back later and do something why will they just hartnett somewhere somebody who was an authority can see who's coming in and what\nThey have the well they are working on single point entries okay a lot of schools doing that in Broward and throughout the country but it's still comes to it like you know so it's a single point entry if there is a student there you can bring anything in that he wants to run\nSo until you know but it's just that society we don't we wouldn't want it like that we didn't grow up like that\nNo we didn't know what I look I don't want there to be I don't want to be a prison that's for sure\nBut at the same time I want to be able to either have enough armed guards and only one per school isn't going to help you out a resource officer there who who sat on who's going to do nothing\nUm I I won't even more of them to to defend our children or I Want there to be fewer entrances or some sort of a a little card or something that you need but says you're allowed to be that this guy wasn't allowed to be there\nAnd he got in and he got in with a rifle bag it doesn't make any sense so if if that sort of scenario can still happen and I wonder if you think you can what do we changed\n[laughter] well it is happening the other day you know how they get right down the street and Lauren Hill them a nine year old walked into the school\nSo I don't you know they're definitely making progress with more on guard single point the entries are they're putting the parameters around schools thought until we get to the point where we make it like a federal building our court house any kid you know if he wants to do their job they're going to get into the school and do I\nDo I just want somebody there to defend against people it is a ... in their ... and it is that it's getting very largely because of your

this week\nOn the Supreme Court returned to foreign affairs because my good friend and colleague and guide\nFor the conflict with China Gordon Chang Joyce fans today a very good evening to garden good evening John we have much to say about the Trump Administration in China later on in the show but we begin looking at the Trump Administration and Korea the Korean Peninsula\nUh especially North Korea I understand the secretary of state is traveling to North Korea and the next day is is this the delayed meeting from earlier in the ... in the air\nThis was delayed because President Trump called off a secretary Pompeo's trip to I'm young I Believe it was just going to remember the before then compare went appealing young first week of July the meeting was a disaster and since then we have not really have the progress that everyone has hope\nFor and gotten are the Chinese watching this are they just bogged down in trying to adjust their GDP to look like growth what is this critical to she that palm pale is going into ...\nOr I think that the Chinese see this as an opportunity because they've got so many they've got so few options on trade and the other areas to dispute with the United states\nThey probably see this as some place where they can bargain their cooperation for help on something else where otherwise they would have the solutions we welcome\nOur colleagues suddenly professor suddenly of Tufts University professor of very good evening to you what is the mission for secretary of pump pale why is he going to North Korea this time good evening to\nGood evening hey it's mission should be to make it clear to the north Korea\nGood evening ponytail is mission should be to make it clear to the north Korean leader that unless he takes\nSubstantive measures toward denuclearization like revealing some facilities coming up with him and then three or how many bombs and facilities he has unless she does that\nPompeo should tell him we are going to enforce continued to enforce sanctions against you and you'll enablers Chinese as well as South Korea and entities who go on violating UN and us sanctions however I fear\nSecretary Pompeo may do the opposite and concede\nThat apiece declaration so cold which is what North Korea and South Korea have been calling for incessantly over the past several weeks that the U.S would be amenable to signing such and and the Korean War peace declaration which is a trap\nNorth Korea has been calling for a peace treaty with the United states with a view toward effecting\nThe U.S troops in South Korea in the wake of a peace treaty between the two countries the very red on debt through all of us troops into south would come under fire and they would be a lot of political pressure building up in South Korea and North Korea will call for their withdrawal maybe Americans would agree with that\nWhich are all of us troops so that is the endgame North Korea has in mind and step by step\n\nA\nMajor hub to hub the president of geo strategic analysis and director of the strategic strategic to tourists studies at the Mitchell Institute joins Gordon Chang my colleague we're addressing\nA global concern which is the possibility of nuclear conflict there is a new paper from Princeton university's global zero\nProposing but you'd have to say is a dramatic reduction in nuclear warheads and the way we watch people with nukes Peter a very good evening to you what is global zero what is their mission statement good evening\nThe evening and thank you Gordon thank you John for this global zero as an organization devoted to the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide by twenty forty which will be primarily\nDone by unilateral reduction by the United states because other countries as well as they say in this new report or have to follow suit because of our wonderfully a moral example\nPeter that's not going to happen it seems to me that if ever you're going to get to a global zero it will be because everybody realizes they can't outspend the United states\nI don't understand the logic of our unilaterally reducing our arsenal to the point where it may not be usable and essentially having everybody else says yeah we'll we'll we'll do the same thing they're recommending\nThree hundred warheads go ahead Peter\nLet's go back to twenty twelve and they issued a report very like this ah this was last report it called for\nA thousand warheads and the United states arsenal and now they're under three hundred so they've reduced it by Seventy five percent\nThey said at that time in twenty twelve Russia was not a threat\nThan they did a survey of people who are members of the council Foreign Relations and said in twenty twelve is Russia threat and the number of them said no and therefore they included Russia was not a threat that day they issued the report was the day the foreign minister of Russia issued or a threat to use nuclear weapons against NATO missile defense sites\nAnd as my friend mark Snyder has done since twenty twelve\nThe Russian military or civilian including Mr Cooper and you issued thirty\nThreats to the United states and our allies to use nuclear weapons these are not been implicit these men explicit threat so what they basically done in this twenty eight team report\nIs instead of having Fifteen hundred and fifty more heads under the new start treaty we would have\nThey take around to fix the we'd have to step Marines that the that would be it\nThe other three would be a import and\nWhen you look at what the motives are we'd probably have as low as a hundred and thirty warheads what would happen is instead of having five hundred and nine targets meaning land based missiles bombers and submarines spread all over the country will be down to five to ... the juice up bases ... bomber base\nBombers would not be usable warheads would be put elsewhere and then they have this crazy idea that warhead and missiles would be separated\nAnd where would we store these hundreds of warheads well they're empty silos in ten of it used to be minute men's silos which you know Cartwright the negotiated with the Russians that we would not put missiles in them so we put all our warheads\nOh Cartwright the negotiated with the Russians that we would not put missiles in them so we put all our warheads there and then we put up a bull's eye on it and it bright red so the Chinese and Russians good no but they just took out all our warheads didn't matter whether we had some rain bombers or I should be left which we wouldn't we wouldn't have any more\nSo in their twenties twelve report they said it is reasonable to believe that the Russians and the Chinese the Syrian at the north Koreans Iran at targets equally in about a thousand that we could\nRationally save needed to be hit and retaliated against and taking out\nThose numbers have all of a sudden crashed to less than a couple of hundred and what they've decided to do is no military targets would be hit\nIn any country no conventional military targets would be hit in or a tablet choice strike we'd hit their banking their communications and their cities and that would be it and we wouldn't have to retaliate quickly because city banking communications don't move they're all sitting there so we would take at least\nNo less than Seventy two hours to respond if we wanted to and if we put warheads out in the midst of an silos Montana uh give me an example for a minute man based to put warheads back on the missiles you can do three missiles per month or wing and there are three ways\nTo do nine missiles a month you could put one more head back on minute man if you want to but they want to get rid of a player on the global zero wants to eliminate all minute band so we would go down from well over five hundred targets to as I said five\nArtist with me and we do this unilaterally\nYes unilateral surrender works if a unilateral surrender includes the fall I Want to know how I can joined the international monitoring program\nI Hope they have really cool uniforms because well because their job will be exhausting to guarantee that unilateral surrender has been sustained by the fall\nBut what's interesting at the end this hundred and something page report oh there they they\nDon't talk about verification because you can verify for example will be alerted and that's your favorite thing it's like turning off a missile what were the key stroke of a computer I can turn it back on and I could targeted wherever I Want to target it nobody will know so there's no verification of course but then they say and this is toward the end they say\nEverybody has to now not to use weapons first they have to vowed not to deploy attack submarines in certain areas the oceans in order to make the submarine safe and\nThis is what they say in which everyone and I'm quoting sincerely vows\nTo do this quote unquote so sincerely vows is like a marriage\nWedding is you sincerely vow to you know on her and be true to your wife or your husband that now is that we now have marriage and the nuclear policy instead of\nTrust but verify it's if they sincerely vow to do it then it's okay and that's literally that is a quote from the end of the a book or this hundred and seven page book so now we're gonna have unilaterally ten percent of the Russian force\nWill have it somewhere between twenty and forty percent of the Chinese force animal have about\nTwenty percent of our current force that is allowed under a treaty for getting rid of everything now one of the things is really strange is\nAll the suffering has had a whole new set of sixteen missiles\nEvery missile Bruce Blair says put eight or heads on which is by the way the maximum you can put on it what happens if the Russians bust out of the global other new start treaty or the Chinese built up we will have no buildup capability which Bill Clinton George Bush and Barack Obama all hall that edge\nAnd we would have no hedge we would be stuck at about two hundred and fifty survivable warhead to see\n'em that would be it and the other guys to build what ever they wanted a bill\nGardens we have about a minute So Peter you mentioned something before about how potent has been a threatening to your sense of use of nuclear weapons\nHe's been doing that especially with regard to the Baltics we've just got about thirty seconds if you can run through how global zero would do with pollutants threats to use nukes\nTo start a war do they have a plan Peter a thirty second\nNo no no no I'm not at all that's the whole point of building low yield weapons on a cruise missile or a deep five submarine missile it gets there quickly within Neal twenty to thirty minutes which we don't have anything that can get there that quickly today that's why it's not a question blow your weapons is a question can you get them to the battle\nOpponent by the way announced this new strategy in April two thousand and two thousand six he said this is how we're going to do it and we're going to exercise this way and we're going to build these things and then twenty fourteen announced everything's going to be built done deployed in the field by twenty Twenty one\nAnd this I'm quoting are strapped commander General John heightened so potent started doing this that can twenty two thousand in April and during the Clinton Administration and he's ... years away from\nThe ... the up the geostrategic analysis and director of strategic deterrent studies at the ... Gordon Chang I'm John bachelor [noise] a\n\n\nDeadly police shooting in South Carolina ... Fox News new details in the shooting of police officers and sharing Japanese in Florence county toxicity Rapaport has more lie\nLisa one officer was fatally shot and six wounded while attempting to serve a warrant in an upscale neighborhood authorities saying they had no idea about the danger waiting for them these officers\nOrange County sheriff Kenny boon\nVoted off says go get respect they deserve\nSituations to hold\nThe suspect taken into custody but officials did not provide other information about the shooter governor Henry McMaster tweeting the selfless acts of bravery from the men and women in law enforcement is real just like the power of prayer Israel\nI my sense is that there's been some you know a indication or some um you know direction not to cover this issue so I Would say most people on Fox hunter largely unaware of what's happening there\nUm but uh in in certain circles you know many Pakistanis or move across the border have a are married to women who live in ... women\nUm and there are some businessmen who traveled there and then people who are who see consumers of of local news so they're well aware of what's going on and I think um you know as long as the situation continues and investors\nUm and you know there may be a response especially from a religious circles and even extreme of circles inside Pakistan and so I don't think it's an issue that can be swept under the rug\nAnd especially if the if the Chinese and the Fox honeys\nWould like to have this kind of a a economic uh kind of activity and uh the free flow of people and goods across the border\nUm and you know they're spending billions of dollars on on developing the physical connectivity over the land border you know I I I just don't see a future in which there can be um you know a great deal of economic activity and the infrastructure can caught you know pay itself back\nOr so there's a human rights angle which is you know it's in it's a moral abomination you know and respect what's happening but then there's also the economics of it should John it's supposed to be this outpost connecting I Try not to um to the Eurasian land mass and a and I just don't see that happening\nReally what's happening in terms of Pakistan is that the government has been supporting China with regard to the situation\nAnd this is where China's debt trapped diplomacy is called is actually working\nBecause right now in Muslim about you're not going to get a senior government official on the record criticizing the Chinese but of course when you look at the mass of people in any a Muslim majority country\nUm this does not sit well people may not say anything day to day largely because they are feeling coerced\nOr because you know sometimes I just don't know about the issue but this just doesn't work when you're starting to look at for instance countries like Kazakhstan we're a long time you know the Kazakhstan government didn't say anything about ... and now is really being forced to I think you're going to see the same thing in Pakistan\nThe fact that it is in the news is that a tell that they're frightened of it there\n[noise] yeah definitely because you know if another country was doing that let's say if the United states was doing that to its Muslim population it would certainly be in the news it would be on the cover of newspapers and on and the headlines there so uh I think clearly a there's a you know some sort of\nReason there's an obvious reason why I'm a private media in office and the state owned media is a is most likely suppressing the information I it is covered to some degree in English language press\nUh but you know it's not something that's that's all right on the front page and you don't really see it um you know people are are ... you know outspoken about it ... you know especially if you know in comparison to let's say a scenario if it was a you know happening in the United states\nQuickly Ira the orange line metro

United States and Mexico will be a whole page on this\nYear at pools are desperate for growth and um they don't want to offend China and uh because they have a lot of businesses that operate ... quite a bit of money so I expect very level of agreement between those three parties on this and the Chinese are are\nI think are banking on that because they know that the Europeans are kind of split with the Americans right now both politically and economically\nAndrew I'm what is the state of the Chinese economy today I mean especially after the September numbers is it a better than people say or where do you see it going [noise]\nWhile the number so far that exports were up fairly\nHelpfully and courts were up a few August numbers which are twenty percent pretty good showing 'em so there's a bit of weakness in the export powerhouse area of course we don't often in the south which accounts for twenty percent of exports and they're starting to see a bit of a recession so we may be seeing the beginning\nBut so far the economy's been at the health holding up surprisingly well\nAnd is that because of trade friction or is it does some other factor\nI'm pretty sure that they we can go out and going is because of trade friction the data's inconclusive at this point but given that they have a lot of small businesses that export about ... different kinds of cotton goods another close to the United states I'm sure it's trade related\nAnd and one other question on on just the technical aspects of this it took me a little bit by surprise but I saw that China's gonna borrow three billion dollars why they're doing that [noise]\nBecause it basically adventures in the west to assume that a Chinese government that is perfectly cell or because they have a large a trade surplus\nThey have a three trillion dollars of overseas and foreign exchange and they have not defaulted on any national or external debt I'm so it it's a good bet if they can get a decent interest rates are going to look for overseas capital\nBut why would the Chinese need the money\nWell the because often uh overseas are willing to pay\n[noise] well the because often uh over seems\nThat are willing to pay a lot of extensive capital domestically there's a huge amount of debt so they're looking to try to extend that into a new source of the capital overseas it's it's a reasonable strategy [noise] the puzzle\nChina is looking for a negotiation with the United states or not the U.S is looking for negotiation with China or not are they in a waiting game Andrew and how long the wait how long before things deteriorate [noise]\nI think the Chinese are more or less given up because of the Trump Administration is it's I don't think it's really interesting in itself\nThere's actually when the Chinese to change the entire basis of their economy\nWhich the Chinese are are unable to do\nIt would be one thing if the Trump Administration said okay look you've got a few stolen some of our technology a certain cases you're steel mills are being supported by the government\nThese are areas that we think you should focus on instead the ... the ... of the others make very broad brush statements and the Chinese are thick are starting to get to the point where they're washing the hands of the whole thing um ... it's just a political football\nSo if they wash their hands what is the timeline does anybody advance a timeline does this go on to spring Nineteen spring twenty how long\nI think this is going to go on for a number of years because the Trump Administration as I said it's not going to alter its behavior so far we've not seen that and the Chinese themselves have figured that um so they're going to try to deal with their own domestic economic problems in terms of slowing growth\nThe only thing that I could help is just a lot of small businesses in America stop start going on or having large unemployment and putting pressure on Trump's base we haven't seen that yet though\nSo Andrew in Hong Kong what is the mood about the Chinese economy long term I'm I get the sense that people are pretty optimistic but where do you use it\nThey are pretty optimistic because so far the crash that will do people have been predicting that\nThe economy is definitely slowing of don't we're not seeing massive default we are seeing it increase in default and corporations and small lenders but not NAFTA false and the leadership is vital script over the riskier banks in the system\nSo so far it's been a kind of a of a gradual decline but no collapsed and then you've got the booming tech sector with the huge\nA bike do ten cents I'm and other ... Ali Baba the Amazon of China that are doing very well and doing very well for western investors so that's a a an OK picture\nAnd I get I gather the central bank is basically decided to um ease up a little bit on the money supply basically make a little bit more cash available and that has been able to get the country's true right\nThat's exactly it they basically after tighten credit for awhile and shutting down some of the riskier pass\nThey start are starting to open the speak again and they're hoping to fuel gross in small businesses will have a lot of employees to keep employment unfortunately it looks like a lot of the credit just going to go to the state firms that are the most inefficient so this is really not good for China's long term a structural growth\nBut it's just the way the Chinese system operates\nA we have about a minute Andrew I'm I'm most interested the Chinese confidence believes that the country can grow without an accommodation with the United states is that correct\n[noise] while there they were not happy about it\nBut she took care of the president is dealing with you know that\nHe's dealing with um an attempt to cut down on pollution he's got a lot of domestic problems and he's looking at a trumpet minister ration that hardly knows what it does from day to day so his attitude is if I Can't control it I'm going to have to deal with what I can control domestically\nSo um they're kind of stuck and uh there's not much more they can do\nAndrew Collier is the managing director of the Korean capital research he is in Hong Kong this morning where the weather is better and he's the author of shadow banking and the rise of capitalism and China Gordon Chang the Daily Beast I'm John ...\n\n\nA deadly police shooting in South Carolina I'm Lisa ...

Harris had to say and uh one of the things that the president has said is look the U.S is with Kavanaugh all the way he said on Wednesday that his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nIs is is what people want that there was such enthusiasm and energy for the judge\nAnd look at the polls than the polls show that something big happening he's a fine man of great and all the countries with him all the way recent polls have indicated that nationwide opposition to Kevin uh increase in the days following his hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee on Thursday\nKavanaugh and Dr Ford the first woman to publicly accused him of sexual assault testified as we all know last week regarding the allegations\nAnd then there was a the fallout from that and the polls depending on the pole in it it goes in different directions just like everything else of it it depends on if it's a more I'm biased poll or it means to the writer it leans to the left\nAnd his recollections of what happened the reaction to it and that kind of stuff and you don't want him is that in to the vault coming up round the bend here next on the ATM and then a conversation with\nA darn near all new conversation about\nWhat do you do when you go out and you're trying to just eat better right we don't have to just eat constant crap I mean listen don't want to live a life where you're not even compete sit here and they're not and eat and I don't know why isn't chocolate cake for diving into the jury does whatever your your food is that's not great for you\nAnd especially when the new study comes out that shows\nOne in three adults eat fast food everyday now that is not great great I mean how many times you eat in fast food a day\nBut I guess they grab and go right grabbing go the food but because of that whole idea of putting calories on the menu now when you go to eat have you noticed is you go out to eat\nAnd I mean even if you're doing good you look good would ever do I I don't know there's something about seeing those calories it's freaky isn't it like it's like thinks you'd think aren't that many calories are wow like your whole a lot and then for the day so we have a great conversation on Forbes books at bedtime with\nA dog here which we have a couple of conversations with her months and in this case we talk about okay well what's some good option and she hit on one that is my absolute favorite meal we'll see if you can pick it up is like my favorite and she said it and I knew it\nBut it um it's interesting and I thought about it today because I'll just say I had a salad for lunch salad\nSo imagine one in three adults fast food on any given day federal study to look at how often that happens the Centers for Disease Control and prevention released the numbers it's based on a survey of ten thousand adults over four years\nAnd they didn't find the difference between men and women didn't higher income families a fast food more often than lower income families and I'm black people they say African Americans ate it more than other\nUm ethnic groups and they broke the town of course the high calorie fast food leads to the things we know that aren't great for us um obviously and could be the ultimate\nA deal for us heart disease with clogged arteries but like I said\nEasy to um easy to say that it's not a big deal easy to say but you know you\nCan you can get a around that but then you get stuck now being stuck\nOr ...

heads a one other was shot in Florence they have\nThey they have somebody in custody for this but I'm Sorry you know I read the story about the police officer just so sad and this was about serving a warrant\nBecause they're serving a warrant and there was a twenty twenty year old guy inside the house\nAnd um\nWas the last they were able to take it they were able to take them into custody and it's a\nAgain just terribly starting to hear these reports initially that three deputies into the city of Florence officers have been shot\nNot happening around seven forty five East German and there were ... kids were hostages so turned into a just an um an unbelievable nightmare as what it turned into it it was supposed to be\nA serving a warrant that's what it was supposed to be and the cop killings\nAnd it has to stop I don't get it this is I mean it seems to be the territory you did not tread on\nPat is listening to us I think in Wisconsin hey pat\nSee I was just listening to talk about the officers\nKilled in the warm to strikes me to do it on a trick the strong feeling on the most compassionate for them and their families grow job they're doing everything but\nAmerica the only time we hear about this killing of the return of the cop nationwide news grandma ... killed or a country on the porch or a little girl the girl under\nHundreds of people killed every day on the concrete and all kinds of crimes that are out of work shirt or a bar border post killed is Spanish or goes and we'd be better off to\nThe crime and the short lived near morality and not just for their officers killed\nI think we should always address that I I agree with you it shouldn't be just about something that's easier to highlight although I think it is terrific and I think that there is a targeting thing that happens in this case\nI think it was one of those domestic violence calls and somebody going out and then that's what happens and then other people responded turns into a nightmare but you\nWent out and then that's what happens and then other people responded turns into a nightmare but you bring up pat a really good point\nUm shouldn't all of that the part of what we talk about shouldn't there be more conversation about morality how people are feeling what's going on out there that people are snapping the way they are and then you hear sometimes you hear will know they've\nThat was that ... that that guy was really a good guy and I I knew him for a while down the street it's not always oh they were crazed and they were wild\nSomething's wrong and we're missing connection and that's part of the pat thanks for thanks for bringing that up and thanks for calling\nAnd I think he hit on something that we've hit on before in America tonight other people have talked about it we've had psychologist on saying\nThat technology I'm\n... ... the the ... against them mentality the isolation of people is it worse than it's been before is that there's more people is it a combination of all those things and it it is a combination of all of those things and it isn't just police officers\nBut it used to be that you wouldn't do that I I mean just wouldn't do that he he wouldn't\nShoot it officers because you call the officers in in certain situations and they would help you and it wouldn't be okay I'm I'm wild about what's happening here so they take us back\nInto ... the the kids were heard it was a two hour standoff in the upscale neighborhood just outside of Florence South Carolina and uh they had a bullet proof\nVehicle basically they had to be used to rescue the wounded officers because the man had the kids inside for two hours they wouldn't say why they were serving a warrant they didn't name him or the wounded officers or give the conditions because I keep digging into this we still haven't found any of that we do know\nThe um officer who died parents Caraway fifty two Thirty years as a police officer and uh he died so he had a family terrible a terrible thing that's that's for sure and\nUh it's terrible really in the ... that violence\nThings are leading people and violent directions for what we don't know the details exactly of this story but there is no story you can say that will make you think oh well yeah that's that's how badly that reaction happened no no uh there's no excuse for adding someone's life there's no reason of course now\nThat's a you know where you just go after somebody whether they're a cop or whoever it might be kind of it that\nSubtle not even subtle were at that snapping point right and I hate to just play into all of that but there are he's right there are things that are on report it and if you knew everything that was reported boy you'd you'd walk already be hard pressed

joining us now the former congressman from Ohio here on America Tonight with me Kate Delaney he's now with TOP Media news\nBob this is big that NAFTA first of all I'm finally comes about because you know look like Trudeau and Canada was really stuck in this and that they weren't going to agree but something changed right\n[noise] that's right it's it's the new NAFTA I'm calling it the it's like the YMCA or something\nBut it's a it's a great deal I mean when Trump said he would he would renegotiate it for twenty five years everybody's saying we've got to do something [laughter]\nYeah yeah you know you look at the new deal and there's the requirements that cars trucks imported from Mexico and Canada have to qualify for duty free access that's one of the thing uh uh they have to be manufactured with Seventy five percent component from three ...\nUh uh they have to be manufactured with Seventy five percent component from three the three countries that huge also that the work that's done sixteen dollars per hour for labor so that means that I'm Mexican companies are going to have to raise wages that is a very big deal\nWith that is because you know our problem for example in China is they they have slave labor basically idle and people were twenty eight days a month or practically nothing we can't I don't care how productive we can't compete\nWhen you something like this provision that first of all as it's great for human beings and on top of it it's it's great for us it balances things out dairy farmers of course when\nMaybe some other people in in the process with commodities\nBut yeah I I'm just viewing this year and people are trying to be skeptical it is something that people have been promising to do for almost a quarter century and he's done it I think that's fantastic\nYeah ... years you cannot take that away from Donald Trump absolutely a hundred percent agree with you that happens that the big moment and then when I'm Donald Trump is doing a press conference for it turns toward cabin I started getting asked\nQuestions about that and really at first didn't want to talk about it then he starts to kind of\nYou know kind of hem and haw about the the Kavanaugh thing and then from said look I'm fine with the FBI interviewing cabinet or a third accuser so he's saying do what they had to do he's he's basically putting it back on um you know the Senate right\nShort one of the national media started to report that he told the FBI you could only talked to people cetera and I just can't be accurate and if it is the FBI would have to tell the ... what is the president told us\nHe says it can be comprehensive no people took the words where he said you know he also feels that it could be a fishing expedition where you could just go on for months with this thing or you know you could have\nFifty but not on this phone calls and do you you know investigate those types of things but I think in generally clearly said it it can be comprehensive the FBI who will do it\nThey take about a week so do you have a vote by friday I think Frank\nAnd we know Kavanaugh denied that the New York times reported Monday that in September of Nineteen eighty five Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a bar where he was accused during ice and another patron\nThe times went to a police report of that incident in New haven into Kavanaugh was not arrested according to that report the victim in that case said that after Kavanaugh hurled the ice a friend of his through a glass and hit\nThe victim in the ear causing him to believe the man was treated a hospital\nAnd Kavanaugh speaking the officers didn't want to say if he threw the heights of or I'm not because this is what's happening every possible rock is being a return former MBA player Chris Dudley said he regularly drank with Kavanaugh wild with your classmates at Yale and said he never ever saw\nHim the blackout drunk\nThe but that they drank a lot together so\nThis is going to go on probably at least for a couple more days and it depends on that whole vote thing when one of the vote going to go on or not because uh McConnell's thing one thing and he sang the Senate's going to hold that vote\nThis week so if they hold the vote this week\nWell does that mean you know the end of the week or what does that mean and I guess they wrap up that investigation\nHe says it's time for the endless delaying obstruction has to come to a close he said judge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee were considering it here on the floor and will be voting this week he made the comment McConnell did\nWho in the Senate majority leader during a Senate floor speech and this comes as the FBI has to wrap this up though and you know listen they got to wrap this up by friday so I guess they could vote friday or go into the week\nThe Republican senators and aides have been careful not to pin down a specific timeline on the nomination and that's smart because how do they know what if the FBI wraps it up before the friday deadline what if they wrap it up Thursday whatever it is so\nMcConnell filed culture before see here's something so McConnell waited until friday to file cloture on the nomination that would set up an initial vote on ending debate as early Sunday\nIf he filed closure before that he could bring up the vote as soon as the friday deadline pass or when the FBI wrapped it up so they are playing the waiting game that's what they have to do so far what we do know it's senator Collins and Senator Murkowski or undecided\nAnd Jeff Flake\nSaid he he would support Kavanaugh but he was key to getting that one week investigation into the allegations he said over the weekend he expects to support him unless the FBI find something in ...\nThe ... he said over the weekend he expects to support him unless the FBI find something in the investigation so it really rats I guess on this and investigation\nAhead um is it going to uncover something that's a definite definite some things that they can now with that whole evidence thing\nBecause I I think that's where they're going to go with this so if you flip a coin and give it a little better odds I'd say you know what I'd say because everybody's pressing me on this too I Would say it's sixty forty sixty ... confirmed\nForty not it's just\nYou know it's just too close to close to say what happens in the case of flake especially because he would be really going to call the swing vote he would be the swing vote if you look at the numbers\nAnd so therefore unless somebody else decides to ... hour to go in a different direction but it's a very very unlikely I call this segment odds and ends because there's so much we don't get to talk to talk about rather on America Tonight and by the way you can always\nJam in on the conversation whatever you want eight five five to six six fifty two eighty three let me flip out that the digits against eight five five to six six fifty two eighty three so I Love this I mean I got to give some applause to this\nTo me we have Halloween 'cause you know already as the Halloween decorations all over the place it's it officially ... then what Thanksgiving and Christmas the whole holiday thing\nBut check this out you know help Black Friday is always so big\nAnd people are leaving um\nHouses to go stand in line overnight after they eat their Thanksgiving dinner 'cause they get these incredible buys and if there was the first person in the door they get a a giant flat screen TV for five dollars or whatever it is and they always it is kind of crazy deals they have but they don't tell you there's only like three of them available\nSo I'm\nOn Black Friday is a list came out on Monday of sixty stores that are not going to open\n\nOn Thanksgiving I say bravo to that Cosco ikea Sam's Club Home Depot Lowe's they're pretty big stores there saying nope they're gonna they're gonna keep a close close because then their employees would have off\nA game stop open on Thanksgiving for the first time in ... twenty Seventeen Stein Mart and shoot carnival close after being\nOpen in previous years\nSo there's a list\nOf huge retailers that are balking on that whole idea of the specials\nAnd I think it for them because they know they have competition Amazon is crushing everybody\nWith the crazy delivery the costs like you know hardly anything um and what they offer online interface us as brilliant he's what he's like Dr evil taking over everything right and left [laughter]\nOr ... I don't know capitalists but [laughter] that's the thing with Amazon get a look over your shoulder 'cause where they go in next\nAnd it's interesting it it it's great that they're not doing that because why let people have a break man let them have a break and maybe it's that there'll be gaming all night long and then\n[noise]\nMy name is on the map a quickly I'll go to a couple of stories that I was looking at earlier in the um earlier in the day and\nOne of them was a this one and it it has to do with the fact that you've got um well I like\nI have no idea what's going on with these airlines because we keep seeing that none of these things are happening and they're having to to lands planes and when I say that there's kind of a may there was a mayday call with this Australian\nFlight and it is you know the horror was\n... I mean what's going on because they just hear this mayday mayday just really creepy but they United a slight ended up\nLanding thank goodness and it's a it landed safely in in Sydney after the

bombshell report that came out on Donald Trump's\nTaxes on his release father Fred Trump they're saying now that his father funneled at least four hundred and Thirteen million basically the equivalent to his son and they're saying including instances of outright fraud\nSo the times\nFound in in the report in the way at least a hundred and forty million for sure like where it was tied\n'em there's the in the report they had a whole bunch of ways that this was being buried and now New York's department of taxation is vigorously pursuing this so when you look at this do you think\nThat um this puts the presidency in peril or do you think\nThat um it could be just a matter of he's going to pay a ton of money back well I think if there's this fraud and the New York tax\nBoard goes after it and they can uncover the way it was being funneled then they could charge interest and all of that on top of it and I think um yeah it would be a money thing it couldn't be criminal thing\nBecause the statute of limitations I've said it's on another show would be up on that but um\nIt could be that is the money thing that the ... they'd have to pay the taxes\nWhatever tobacco taxes were and if they go way back to think about the interest with that interest I guess look like would it look like\nI mean I think it would be a ton of money from what they're saying so\nSomebody said to me today we'll

policy of shrinking the balance sheet faster\nThe ISI the is growing they're slower that has okay he's acquaintances for financial markets and then the same week that they can take those measures we see problems in Italy we see time trials backing up\nTo today's ... getting up at the crack to him oh what a what I saw going on was fiscal issue all of a sudden like the debt is upon us as many people predicted more debt more paper price down you'll up so that I worked at Princeton\nWell I I think that's a you know part of the story here but I don't think we have really new information on the debt debt right we we know what the debt levels are uh you know based on the attacks planned and the spending plans that from earlier this year so I\nYou know what I think the bigger part of the story is something we don't have a lot of experience with and that's understanding the dynamics of central bank balance sheets sizes on financial conditions\nJumped out while I Want to go I got to get married for twelve see out go look okay go to our PIN I'm Carl it seems as though you've got a potential balance here on the one hand you have a huge fiscal deficit correct that is growing\nAs a result the question becomes what do you do\nAs a result the question becomes what do you do about it well you can inflate your way out of the debt and make it less valuable that's the one hand but at the same time interest rates are on an upward march\nSo that anything that you borrowed a pay off for to roll forward anything get slightly more expensive at the same time enter all of the things you just did into your age PC calculator\nWhat kind of situation do you find interest rates in because they seem to be getting squeezed from all these different market forces well\nThey're getting squeezed but they're getting squeezed higher so obviously if you're borrowing more than that uh August for high rise straits\nBut also by borrowing more your juicing the economy to use a technical term there for Tom how you're using the economy which creates more inflation which pushes interest rates all the all that much higher as well so that that's really kind of\nThe regime was going to be in over the next couple of years and what's difficult to the the biggest challenge for fed policy this fiscal stimulus is temporary it's not a new normal for a two or three year phenomenon\nRight you really slam on the brakes at the fed to slow down the drain which is due to slow down when he entered it over to run out of\nTime I get the dynamics of of a fiscal slowing down its cetera but at the same point if if the economy that real GDP comes down all of a sudden the de ... can become larger Juba number you're a ... point unreal GDP\nOr what are you going to take away from that game for the game the Saturday\nBut we knew going in Rhode Island as it was an outstanding football game that too and won their only last words that over time was to uh FBI she caused so they were very good football team probably the best at twenty five years and uh we played really hard at times really well especially on the defensive side of the ball but\nIt made it some big plays on the fence and they held us the tree field goals in the red zone\nAnd that was the difference in a twenty three sixteen games so um you know again because I thought we played really well west orange break a corner out of Denver and many Kelly corner auto Greensboro in North Carolina\nBoth uh had two huge interceptions in the red zone or or to inside tackles rich you ride it out of Pittsburgh and stone heart out of a lumpy at Washington\nReally had monster games up front and at times I thought we played a role Merkley and really well Detroit simply we just need to make some more big plays especially in the scoring scoring zone\nCoach I Wonder if you could just get into the head of us for a a forest or into the head of Jake McIntyre he's your uh he's he's your kicker junior kicker and he had a pretty good game against Rhode Island\n[noise] well the thing about your fellow says that ah I mean eases automatic as you get you know he's one of those kids that are\n... it's so easy to work with everything he does is is simple he's very uncomplicated he's an outstanding student um about a three nine students is one of the cop show gold triggers in that country out of a northern Florida and um you know it just seems to make it up or less\nWell he nailed one more from thirty seven and then to from thirty for what is he just sold disciplined than focused when that happens\nTo ... it's a combination of a talent discipline and focus but in his career he something like twenty two out of twenty seven and two of the twenty seven to the ones he messed were bad snap so he's clearly one of the best kicker is in the country\nUp the customer every morning I I Want to ask you when you go through this every year but I think it's fascinating for all of our listeners in the college derby how to recruit I mean

bomb story Mississippi the bonds are driving the market let's start with bonds today go ahead I'm Sorry we have to talk about the bonds but we weren't going to do that and you're a treasure yelled has risen to the highest since two thousand and love and we want to\nAnd it's the biggest today gain is in more than a year and it really raises a question are we seeing a sustainable break out here that we'll continue and that will wreak havoc on markets that have relied on low benchmark rates\nAre one of mine and here there you go\nI mean certainly look at what's happening in the stock market it's clear that higher rates are leaving their market I mean you go through the main industry groups in the U.S and the five hundred\nFinancial companies is pin was pointing out definitely stand out and if you want to talk about an area of the benefits from higher race and you think about the banks right they stand to earn more on their loans and investments and that's a plus for them or the other side of the equation is\nReal estate and a ... makers of consumer staples food beverage tobacco utilities\nAlso to some extent these companies all the phone companies anyway within the new communications services area the market and all those groups are taking a bit of a hit here as you might expect because these are the kinds of science you buy for their ... and those payouts\nDon't look so appealing when you see bond yields go up so it was\nOn a second day of can we take a step back here All right thank you I appreciate that\nAnd try to understand just how much higher rates have been priced in to market valuations at this point in other words if we get an ongoing move upward in ten year treasury yields could we see a pretty big and sustained sell off in the broad equity indices that people have not been pricing in\nWell when you think about what's been driving the market here it's not been the rate sensitive areas I mean you go through and look here today in the the industry group so I was talking about a roll down and yet you've got the U.S and the five hundred up about nine percent for the year so\nThe real question is what happens to the technology companies what happens to the legs of Amazon and Netflix which are in the consumer discretionary category because\nYou know the the ideas that people are going to spend the money that they don't have to spend on those products and services they provide so\nYou know that's really key or health care also a group that's known for relatives stability or also be in the market here so in fact the only three the eleven groups that are beating the S P five hundred for twenty Eighteen so\nYou know the real question is whether what's happening on the front is going to affect those kinds of companies that are meaningful way and that's very much an open question here\nThey both can comment on he lie literally I've been following the fortunes of Eli Lilly the stock is up nearly five percent and this is a big deal for those people obviously who are afflicted with diabetes but also\nThis could be a drug that does more\nRight because a lily came out with study results that showed a their propose diabetes medicine not only brings down A People's blood sugar levels which is the key for any treatment in this area but also help patients bring down their weight\nSo that's the thing that you're alluding to they're right on and so he's going to look at the possibility that these are this drug will work as an obesity treatment and you know who that's bad news for yes but I'm going to let you tell us no bone or this\nDay this company trade pretty actively here in the form of America thought about their sense\nSeven and a half an hour and a half percent I've been lilies up almost five percent so the very least you can say a this study's data may be\nA something that points to a shift with in the diabetes drug markets so I mean obviously there's lots of research to be a little is part and then they have to go get approval so you're talking about years down the line with people is never to believe look ahead with a sort of thing and\nYou know they like what they're seeing with Willie and they're concerned about what it all means for nova\nDon't want to do more bombs\nI mean that's what I think is really the ... okay but I Would well I Would but today in particular I actually haven't got that guy let\nMe ask you do you believe that this is because people recognize that the strength of the U.S economy is not diminished\nI yeah right because I'm not gonna ...\nOrders and bright and while they were you know tens of represent below the survey still durable goods orders\nFor point four percent for August\nWell and that's this follows the record strength that we saw yesterday in the services that data that we've got an eye on them and then we also saw that American businesses out of the greatest number of jobs and seven months for the ATP report yesterday\nTwo hundred and seven thousand for an initial jobless claims it also a good number\nThere's all this good a sort of energy that's feeding into this view at the U.S economy is doing well and then you have the Federal Reserve coming out and saying we're going to keep going with these rate hikes we think that the U.S is going to be able to sustain this momentum even with slightly higher benchmark overnight borrowing costs\nAnd frankly I mean at this point we're not even in a restrictive or even normalized a place yet so all of this is leading to the sort of a ha moment where Yale's could climb higher I think there's some other issues here to whether it's the ISI the pulling back a little bit from their bond purchasing program and the fact\nThat in Japan is also allowed their yields to float a little bit more I think the most interesting thing to watch is what gets hit hardest as a result of these yelled clients and I think that what what really there hasn't been a lot of focus on his investment grade bonds that\nActually they saw the biggest one day drop yesterday since November two thousand sixteen\nAnd I think that's compelling because the average length of these high rated bonds has extended dramatically it's near the eleven years the most since two thousand so you know they're much more sensitive to any rise in ... and and rates that I find that very interesting\nAre you guys are like All right we're done well no I mean I'm just looking at the true you're right and I'm looking at the two year or two eighty seven two point eight seven percent what happens if it reaches let's say two point nine and headsets waited three well the high road\nThe more companies have to pay down the line and that becomes a concern and a whole lot of industries nuts\nThe more companies have to pay down the line and that becomes a concern and a whole lot of industries not just the interest rate sensitive areas where the markets so you know that's where it all starts to get interesting especially at a time when thing about it this year has been all about the effects of the tax law changes in terms of a profit growth revenue growth\nAnd that's going to start to say so you've got things kind of moving in opposite directions right now\nWell Don thanks very much Dave Wilson Bloomberg stocks comments to remember to Sunday even email at the Wilson at Bloomberg dot net and sign up for his daily free email newsletter it is

a window into the story so\nLet's talk about what\nThe actual issue is there was a microchip that at some of these big tech companies\nFound spreads in happenstance yes tell us about\nThat well so [noise] you know most people I think are used to hearing about software ... where are you know people use code to ah to get data out of out of places on this story is more about the technology supply chain and how um official sources tell us that they\nUm they were able to at the factory level get a small microchip a into a server mother board operated uh uh plants that were subcontractors to an American company\n... that I Know was able to sort of get this microchip into the mother board\nRight and then people this is a very this this company sells a lot of server mother board so it's a goes into servers and those go into data centers um for for clouds\nAre in this case a video streaming company was one of the ones that we focused on 'em and then into the data centers run by larger into

[noise]\nSo I Want to be clear that it's not that we're saying that there is evidence that user data was taken or anything like that but they what it does is it gives them deep level of access to

different parts of the network\nI'm an I'm not that kind of thing\nOkay but Amazon reported this right when they ... they were looking to make this acquisition developmental and they found this out

there had been aside during the day began to investigate it more deeply and we report on the\nAlright he'll just sort of give a sense of what the implications here are because this is actually massive\nThe idea that China systematically implanted chips in the hardware that ended up on computers from ever from the Pentagon to the biggest technology companies or where they could basically have a back door entrance to a lot of different computers has\nHuge and vast ranging implications I'm just wondering I mean from what you were getting a sense when you were talking with people with is the reason why we're having trade tensions that China is is the reason why you know that the U.S government has been increasingly tense with Annys Shin what's going on here well\nOur reporting shows that it's certainly something that's been of concern we report that uh there was a a ... there were meetings that took place in a several years\nOh we report that uh there was a a there are meetings

any notes taken in relation to the documents must be destroyed or handed over to officials due to federal classification procedures\nThe majority leader also filed a cloture motion giving Senate

members review and be briefed on the supplemental materials before ... ...\n... ... ... ... can move forward earlier\nThis where McConnell's announcement came hours before the White House revealed it

judge thirty six years ago Senate Republicans including Foreign Relations committee chair Bob Corker are calling for the FBI findings to be made public to maintain transparency\nA whiz ... there's some way for\nA public report so that we're all doing all the same sheet and as you know things like this league worry that what what ends up happening is one sided leagues things that are good for there's a the other side and so it'd be much better if there were common document\nMcConnell has implied his party has the votes to confirm Kavanaugh to the nation's highest court\nHowever a potential showdown by Senate Democrats can't be ruled out just yet nagging dyke one American news\nAnd how we do want to send it over to want America's emerald Robinson who is live\nAt the White House I Am roles so\nSecretary Sarah Sanders said how the gap with reporters today and did she say anything about McConnell's decision a whole not cloture vote on Kavanaugh suffer me somewhere else\nThey think that's a great decision they're ready to move forward with the confirmation process and they they were very\nQuiet in a certain way for as quite as the White House can be about the allegations last week and then the whole process and now they're really pushing for the Senate to vote and confirmed judge Kavanaugh they felt like they've done their due diligence and giving the say to Dr lately for and into\nOther accusers and getting the FBI to further investigate these matter that the background investigation\nSo now they're saying you know what we've investigated the judges seven times at a point on background so it's time to move forward he's highly qualified and that's the part of the person that the president fails and fast to take that new seat on the Supreme Court in\nPrince of Wales believe us Kavanaugh will be confirmed that despite the pushback from Democrats do they have the votes and we know that senator majority leader Mitch McConnell and find what they do what do you hear\nAt the White House they sound hesitantly confidante just like we heard in the story right before our second marriage and is that\nYou never know what a Democrats are going to come out with a head about potential vote on Saturday clearly they've been working to its credit\nThe further FBI investigation saying that not enough people were interviewed and that Dr blades and block the board was not interviewed and of course the White House the fishing back on that thing that we heard hours of testimony from her they had Democrats had the opportunity to talk to her there and to do their job in the Senate hearing room however\nUh and talking about pushing forward for a boat and if they have the votes they sound like yes they felt like they have the votes however there are still working on there and in fact Sarah Sanders said that they have been calling senators vote the president and the team of working on this here at the White House have been calling senators throughout this whole process\nAnd they're going to continue to do so until there is about clearly there is a questionable once every ... or call and she wouldn't they specifically said the president had himself talked in does\nTwo senators or Jeff Flake the other uh uh no wild card vote and that's on the Republican side also they're going after those vulnerable Democrats in red states that some of their like Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp as they're making calls they're trying to get them to\nCome on board saying that something that Kellyanne Conway pointed out yesterday the senators are in a dicey position because they're in states who are very supportive of the president\nAnd very supportive of his Supreme Court justice nominee and that could have high repercussions for them as they continue to stay alive with Democrats opposing confirmation\nWe've seen a recent polls show and basically confirming what you just said there let me ask you this on Republicans do get those votes that they need what sort of response or can we expect to see from Democrats is there anything that they can do beyond the friday note to start the process further [noise]\nQuestion and that's something I've been trying to get from the White House is how do they feel about the judge Kavanaugh's confirmed how much leverage and will it's let's say that even our house Democrats are Democrat thing back the house how much leverage will they have at that point to continue to oppose this\nThen confirmation as it was Nancy Pelosi has mentioned impeachment how how likely are how possible at that even and then there was the question that's our reporter today will always be an asterisk after cap and I'll name because of these allegations even if he does go on to sit on the high court to of course there than are saying that she hopes not that it's not\nCredible allegations that should follow such a man who has done such public service had been held in high esteem for so many years but again I think the White House do feel does feel that\nEven if he does and get voted on and it does seem like ... you were hearing from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell that he will there there's going to continue to be pushback from Democrats evil and he said on the end that said on the court Gen\n... definitely appears to be the trend leading up to this point so\nI said on the court said\nThat that definitely appears to be the trend leading up to the point so we'll have to say on some are all out\nAll right thank you so much I remember reporting laughter inside the latest without Brett Kavanaugh's nomination process there\nWell let me time all eyes are on a Democrat Senator Joe Manchin has just mentioned as he's reportedly leaning towards a yes vote for a cabin on\nOutward into a new report mansion is seen as being an arm's reach of his affords GOP counterpart and the upper chamber moves forward with the confirmation process the report goes on to suggest although mansion could vote yes he reportedly and doesn't want to be the deciding vote\nAnd there's all kinds of his mansion have clarified his focus does remain our cat announced judicial experience he added that he plans to make a final decision on the confirmation after\nExamining the FBI report which we know senators are doing now\nMansion is considered a wife or roughly five swing votes for capping off confirmation\nAnd President Trump says the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will be on voters' minds during the ... elections next month and a tweet today the president claim the unfair treatment if Kavanaugh\nIs having an incredible and upward impact on voters President Trump going on to say that the people get it a far better than politicians added and it's a great that's great life cannot be ruined by men and despicable Democrats and totally uncorroborated allegation\nAnytime the fight over Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination appears to be this thing and do that as an among Republicans up all from Maryland College published Wednesday down Republican voter enthusiasm and significantly increased since July rising from sixty eight percent say eighty percent\nThat is close to ten point gap between Republican and Democrat respondents to consider the November elections to be very important\nUh Democrats lead on the generic congressional ballad also slapped putting their hopes of winning the White House or the house rather and a question in addition many Republicans believe if Kavanaugh is not confirmed GOP turnout will be much higher\nWhat America's ... sat down with former Bush official and that Ryan to discuss the impact amazing\nTo me about all this they have decided on the left that somehow it is going to be killed by allegations\nThat somehow this massive burden of all these false allegation somehow proof somebody guilty and I think the bigger issue at stake here that we're really discussing jak and I've told people disabuse yourself all the notion of this is just simply about confirming somebody the Supreme Court business about do we actually the people in the country still believe\nAn opportunity to tell her story\nWith the TV cameras off\nAs far as one of the suspicious

listened to try to learn\nFrom what Dr Ford was telling us we took Dr Ford statements seriously\nBut then there was a judge Kavanaugh's turn [noise]\nSome of our colleagues now saying\nConcern about judge Kavanaugh's judicial temperament\nBecause the way he forcefully defended himself that the hearing where he had been accused of multiple crimes\nAnd confused of lying under oath\n[noise]\nWe're not what judge Kavanaugh's temperament is like a on the bench because he spent twelve years on the DC circuit court of appeals\nThat's why the American bar association given the very highest rating not only for his experience\nBut for his temperament as well they interviewed hundreds of lawyers and people who had knowledge of judge Kavanaugh's\nExpertise in his temperament\nDeserving of the highest rating that the American bar association could give [noise]\n\nI Wonder how any of us would feel\nIf we were accused of a crime\nThat we didn't commit\nAnd were forced into the public limelight to defend our good name\nIn our honor than our reputation and to protect her family against the threats that were being made against them\n\nI Do everything possible to push back against the false accusations\nAnd that's what judge Kavanaugh did along the way he again offered\nHis denial\nThe allegations of Dr Ford under penalty of felony\nSo the question is how do we\nDecide\nSo the question is how do we\nDecide\nBecause we're going to be voting starting tomorrow Thomas nomination isn't one word and\nIsn't it one somebody's one word against another don't we either have to believe everything that one says or another\nDo we know who to trust his word ... except when allegations are made about something allegedly that happen thirty five years ago\nWith gaps in the story inconsistencies\n\nWell I think first thing we have to do madam president has put\nThese questions in the proper context\nBut here's the bottom line\nThis is not a case of he said she said\nIt's a case of she said they said\nIn other words the allegations made by Dr Ford or not confirmed or corroborated by any of the other people she said\nThose people she said was president was leading Kaiser\nA female friend one of her closest friends who said not only does she not remember being involved in anything like this she said she never even met Brett Kavanaugh\nThis is not about believing women\nThat's a false choice is not about having to choose between a man and a woman when it comes to allegations of sexual assault\nIs not about being for the me too movement or against it\nBecause who after all could be against women coming forward and telling their story when they believe they've been\nNot what this is about as looking at the specific relevant evidence in this case and the proper framework\nThat evidence goes well beyond the impassioned and unequivocal unequivocal denial by judge Kavanaugh in this case as I said there were three eyewitnesses that Dr Ford said who could come from her story\nAnd all of them directly refuted her story\nWhat's more nothing like this ever came up in the context of six previous FBI background investigation conducted by the FBI during judge Kavanaugh's long and very public career\nWe've been told that\nThe FBI during the course of these now seven background investigations including the supplemental background investigation that they talk to a hundred and fifty witnesses\nAbout judge Kavanaugh don't you think somebody\nDr Ford said if they if there was such a person [noise]\nAnd we know that these claims conflict with the\nAccount so many women who said they've known this nominee to behave honorably not only in high school and college toward them but the countless other women who have known and interact with judge Kavanaugh sense it just seems simply out of character for the Brett Kavanaugh\nThat we've come to know as a result of\nThese hearings in this these investigations and finally the timing of these allegations seem awfully calculated\nEven politically motivated and you compound that with the fact that our democratic colleagues chose not to act on the opportunity\nTo investigate them either through the Judiciary Committee staff or the FBI when it was much more appropriate to do so\n\nWell those are the facts I Believe we should consider and that is the evidence that suggests the judge Kavanaugh is telling the truth the counter arguments offered by our democratic colleagues are not compelling and I think deep down they realize it that's why they keep changing their position for\nMoving the goalposts as you've heard that's why they've finally resorted to talking about alleged ice throwing incidents\nIn college man\nThat's disqualifying\nThey say apparently or let's look at his high school yearbook\nWell I Would stipulate that teenage boys\nWell I was one once for not that smart\nFormer teenage boys\nAnd the dumb things that people say and do\nI think as a judge set our cringe worthy\nBut then we've seen conspiracy theories spun up involving his calendar\nFrom Nineteen eighty two now I admit it's a little odd I think for anybody to have kept the daily calendar and still have\nAt age fifty three but judge Kavanaugh said that's what his dad did and it was a combination calendar and diary [noise]\nSo it tells us some of what he was doing at the time that we're just we're concerned with\nThat I Would suggest that this whole enterprise has gotten so far afield from a search for the truth\nAnd become just\nUnhinged [noise]\nAttempt to defeat the nomination ten in the process\nChew up and spit out\nThe reputation of a good man\nWe know that these are\nThis play has been telegraphed\nOur friends across the aisle manage known their opposition would be equal parts merciless\nAnd relentless months ago when the minority leader said he was going to pose judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything he's got\nWell apparently\nEverything includes last minute uncorroborated accusations made almost forty years ago\nEverything involves\nRefusing to participate in the normal committee process\nWalking out of hearings\nBreaking the rules and involves making loud baiting statements designed to\nIncite people [noise] and includes seeing some of our colleagues get\nQuote it can hangers sense of their offices\nChasing senators and their spouses from restaurants from through airports thought dimension delays in obstructions in every step along the way\n\nHere's what I really think needs to be understood\nOur colleagues across the aisle claimed to be looking out for the victim\nThey claimed to be on the side of empathy\nThe majority leader also filed a cloture motion giving Senate lawmakers until friday to debate on Kavanaugh\nIf a nominee received enough support in friday's key vote the full Senate will likely vote on his confirmation Saturday\nThere'll be plenty of time for members to review and they braved almost supplemental materials\nBefore friday cloture vote\nSo I'm Paul and coach or on drugs ... this evening so the process can move forward ... earlier\nThis where McConnell's announcement came hours before the White

contradictory testimony is raising some serious doubts among senator and legal experts on like on America's parents than Trump spoke with experience trial lawyer Robert barn set who breaks down as some of the problems with foreign ... story\nBut case around and judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation for the Supreme Court has riveted the nation with many focusing on the testimony was accuser Christine Ford\nHowever forwards patchy memory an inconsistent recounting of events has raised serious doubts about whether or not she's telling the truth\nNot only among the senators who are listening tour testimony but among many legal experts and experience lawyers as well\nWhat America news spoke with Robert boards postseason trial lawyer with dozens of years of experience in the courtroom dealing with similar cases mourns explained that not only is Ford's conflicting testimony a serious problem but that she is the very definition of an unreliable witness\nHurricane says all the attributes\nOf a nun credible case if it's a story that could be true literally anyplace any point anytime of any person than it has a high risk of being a planted memory a misplaced memory or simply just known true story and that was the best the attributes or her story of Dr Ford stories he points\nOut that Ford's behavior appeared forced switches her hunch shoulders tilting her head up and using a soft childlike voice all signs of someone trying to gain sympathy and for a career lawyer like Barnes all that raised serious red flags\nShe was telling a story that was scripted for TV and for her own public attention not a story that was likely Deborah hold up under cross examination or evidence Uri challenge\nAdding to this was her conflicting testimony such as when she claimed to have never worked with anyone real polygraph test you know evidence is coming out showing that is not true but burns believes Democrats didn't think these glaring flaws would be a problem since they were banking on Republicans being too afraid to challenge them\nThey're relying upon was that the Republicans in the Senate\nWould be scared and intimidated them trying to cross examining accused accuser much as everybody got beat out after attacking Anita Hill which I also think that you say since back in Nineteen Ninety One\nSo I think their fear of that they thought well she'll get away with things that you wouldn't get away with it in a true legal setting\nAnd forwards inability to recall specific events doesn't really surprised Barnes either who explains that witness testimony is one of the most unreliable forms of evidence available is that people often have deep affiliations and emotions associated with memories and that makes it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction\nParticularly in cases of memory and memories that are thirty six years old and memories that are giving telltale signs\nOf being inaccurate of not being truthful now nearing an looking like a truthful and honest accusation and I always tell people just think of your own lives something traumatic happened do you really don't remember any detail of how you got there and how you left\nBut remember the precise details of the house lay out how many beers you grit\nBarnes adds to the conclusion of the independent prosecutor Rachel Mitchell is also very telling that experienced prosecutor a woman who is spent her life listening to the victims and attorney who's telling the truth or not window on record stating that there wasn't enough evidence to pursue the case and according to Barnes that makes perfect sense\nI mean this is one of the week is accusations really ever brought a you're someone who doesn't know where where they were really doesn't know when they got\nThere it doesn't know how they left can't confirm anyone else who was there a tells a story that doesn't really even ring true on its own face some sharp one American news\n\nPennsylvania woman's fighting and the

Mitch McConnell continues to defend a friday test vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to become a Supreme Court justice speaking in the Senate yesterday McConnell said that he had given lawmakers plenty of time to review an FBI report and the sexual assault charges against Kevin\n... promotion columns on top\nOf what was already been one of the most thorough most exhaustive shut reviews advantage Supreme Court all of a car history of our country\nJoining us now is Kevin Whitelaw Bloomberg News deputy managing editor in our Bloomberg Ninety nine one studios in Washington\nKevin welcome so the majority leader says that there is there was plenty of time to review these documents I saw a tweet from Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy who said that was each senator being given one hour\nTo review the report before a rush to both the confirmation process is just about power politics [noise]\nSo in other words everyone's going to their uh their usual corner known this we've seen a parade of Republicans are come out today and say oh uh FBI found nothing new time to go in a whole bunch of Democrats saying a this was a an incomplete investigation uh and indeed it looks like the FBI only interview about nine or ten people as best we understand [noise]\nUh and were are indeed a under some uh ... felt limited by restrictions the White House and put on the scope of this a supplemental background probe\nSo as usual and the Senate it comes down to a handful of senators were watching a couple of GOP hold outs and indeed a handful of Democrats or who who are also a these potentially still on the fence about where they're going to vote 'em and that's that's a that's all of a what we are expecting a vote sometime tomorrow probably in the morning\nNow that first vote is going to be the procedural vote though\nWith a procedural test vote but I think um you know if he clears that he is good um I don't I don't expect there to be suspense or as much suspense in the in the next day's vote although you know\nThis has been an unpredictable process up to now so uh I'm I'm pretty sure that the White House won't feel fully confident and tell us actually over\nNow the Democratic leader Charles Schumer and his his issued a couple of challenges here\nHe says number one we are reiterating our call that the documents with proper reduction being made available to the public\nHe says why shouldn't all of America see the facts and second he wants to the White House to reveal the directive that was sent to the FBI you once that made public because he says we believe it restrain the investigation from the get go\nWell yeah I was Bloomberg reported yesterday the FBI or did not interview either a Kavanaugh or is accused her a ... a doctor for a and they felt that that was because of the White House ... restrictions are in the way that they designed the probe\nUh there were also a lot of people to walk to an FBI field offices are contacted them and other ways to try to offer their testimony who and those were not followed up on them and almost all cases\nUh again same reason sided I I'm not sure that ... going to get anything of what he wants this uh these background basically this is pages and pages of\nA of interview reports from the FBI these are essentially never made public and there's a single copy that's been delivered to the Senate and it's a kept in a secure rumor senators can go and and read through it on on a pre determined schedule and only a handful of staffers you're talking about a very restricted document\nOne or two Republicans did call for some summary form a of of putting this out there but at this point nobody has agreed on that and and uh the Republican leaders don't seem all that inclined so I think we're both but for now and and probably for a while we're stuck with with the competing accounts of what's in there and what isn't in there\nIn terms of those ... restrictions placed on what witnesses were\nNow in terms of those ... restrictions\nPlaced on what witnesses were questioned by the FBI White House spokesman Raj Shah uh said today that the ones who weren't question ... first hand knowledge and therefore would not be deemed as very credible in a process like this how would they know that unless they questioned them\nWell you know obviously he he'd be working off of of you know what what the description was we just saw a doctor Ford's lawyer put out is a ... a letter several page letter which which contains the\nNames of a number of witnesses or that they had suggested be interviewed and descriptions of of what they had to offer\nYou know this is all about corroborating evidence but I guess at some point it ... does depend on how you wanted to find corroborating evidence and and you know in many cases if they don't have\nFirst ten witnesses you're essentially going with corroborating contemporaneous accounts of of this and that was something that you know became an issue in in the Senate Judiciary hearing\nAs well as some of the the the broader debates about this but\nYou know this is a Republican Party in the White House it's very determined to get their nominee confirmed and it's a democratic minority that's very determined to block it and uh at some point where we're at the point where I Do I Do think the Republicans think they have the votes to muscle it through\nKevin Whitelaw Bloomberg News deputy managing editor thank you very much and now let's get a check of world and national news was ...\nThanks Bob senators filed into that secure room at the Capitol earlier today to read and be briefed on the results of this week's FBI investigation of the recent allegations against judge Brett Kavanaugh Bloomberg's earth Chaplin reports\nTrying to break away from oils as you said reliant a\nDenomination in dollars we see it in a statement from the John Claude younger the president of the European Commission and just recently saying it's absurd to him that Europeans are buying European products like planes in dollars\nAnd we see it in the French foreign minister Bruno the mayor ... saying that the U.S that Europe feels like a ... state because of the dollars dominance\nToo is that all these countries basically saying we want to cast off the yoke of the of the u._s. currency\nIs is partly that you know the uh of another French person namely the former finance minister and prime minister ... said in the Nineteen sixties that the dollars dominance was an exorbitant privilege for the United states\nI mean just one example of that is that when the U.S a\nDollar circulates around the world it's it's it's it's like a free second aisle you to the United states like an interest free loan that the rest of the world is making to the U.S\nAnd other countries say well why not us and it can be a matter of\nNational pride or it could be more commercial and roast recently the issue is with the sanctions on Iran where the Europeans\nWant to continue with the program that uh the United states used to be in which a took away the sanctions Moran in return for Iran's compliance with various cessation of various nuclear activities\nTrump withdrew the U.S from that program in may and now in November he wants to\nIntends to reimpose sanctions the Europeans are saying wait why why should we go along with that and and they say if we had a way if we the Europeans out a way of trends acting with Iran without using the dollar that we wouldn't be under the long arm of the Treasury Department\nDo you say this is not going to happen overnight gives me a sense of of how deeply ingrained the dollar is in the global economy both in terms of of debt of of reserves that sort of\nThing right so it's about two thirds of global reserves are held in dollars a\nIronically the United states do not hold reserves and dollars because every time you know point\nUm but the U.S hold gold instead but uh even countries like Russia and China a whole dollar reserves or the dollar is also used by many countries borrow in dollars\nUm which can make some time sense but it also sometimes not make sense for example if you're a company or a country that does not have any revenue in dollars in your own money in dollars then you're taken a big risk that you won't be able to come up with the dollars when you need them\nMhm [noise] again what would the down side the for the U.S have the the rest of the world basically started shutting the dollar\nWell one wouldn't be that we wouldn't have that exorbitant privilege of a space to be as interest free loan from the rest of the world but I think even more important than that would be a loss of us leadership\nThe dollar is symbolic a has a symbolic value as a sort of the u._s. knitting together the rest of the world to some degree would also be a symptom because the experiences that allies are more likely to ah rely on the dollar for example in the reserves than non allies\nAnd then and finally it would take away one of the ...\nOf the nine hours and then and finally\nIt would take away one of the strongest tools the U.S has which is a building just sanction other countries by depriving them of access to dollars\nThere there has always been the sense that you know you you could have full faith and trust in the dollar or our country is beginning to lose that trust\nYou know the U.S economy still is very healthy us equity markets are up performing the rest of the world are so it's not that there are\nThe U.S is underperforming in any ways but there has been a if you go back to World War two a very gradual diminution in the U.S share of world gross domestic product and so that's in the background I was not an imminent concern\nI don't mean to put you under the thumb here but is the uh the president's move toward these terrorists and and other isolationist if you will policies are going to speed that along\nWell see that's what comes back to what I was caught so given before about the the sanctions there is this effort to create a new special purpose vehicle that Europe would use to trends act with Iran\nAnd uh people like John Bolton national security advisor have pooh poohed that saying it's a half baked ideas which it is actually is it is a half baked ideas to stage\nBut it could be the sign of something bigger certainly betrays widespread dissatisfaction with the U.S which is kind of an never a good thing\nFor thanks to Peter coy Bloomberg Businessweek economics editor joining us in

whole new area of inquiry candidly for investors for CEOs out there really the next wave maybe the next front in the cyber war\nWhat can I just say that what's interesting about this joint really deep deep reporting I spent time on this lots of sources but what's interesting too that reminds us that we have all allowed the global that tech global supply\nChain to really be come a monopoly in China and so that's what you're saying sell any of the big tech companies if they are manufacturing somehow it relates back to China whether it's components whether it's\nYou know putting it all together in

country dominate the manufacturing\nTalked about the vulnerability that comes out of this we're going to get into that much more with Joe Weber he's the editor of Bloomberg Businessweek as well as

let's get to our team ...\nMarkets editor at Bloomberg News guy said legend that's coming up at ... pm last time they both ... than ... interactive brokers studio so let's talk about this I have just kind of quickly tell us about what we're seeing in the markets in terms of\nHow how much breath or we're seeing when it comes to selling\nOh it's pretty ... across the board no question I mean the utility and financial stocks and interesting pair if you think about it though the only ones of the eleven main industry groups in the U.S and people I've heard of the higher\nAnd I say interesting because we think about their on race yeah I mean they're on opposite sides of the seesaw you might say when it comes as his resume utilities\nTend to get him when rates go up because it means they have to pay more to borrow money means they're evidence don't attract investors quite so much\nFinancial is it's sort of the other side of the coin you know they can earn more on their loans and investments that may be that\nPeople are just looking for some relatively safe you know in ... when you look at the economy maybe that's part of it\nIt's a hard one to kind of put the pieces together on I Will say though one thing that's clear is that there's a whole lot more buying and selling going on a if you look at exchanged listed stocks whether it be and when I see her NASDAQ\nA bomb on us just checking out a little while ago up Eighteen percent from yesterday which was in itself one of the busier days of the year without you know futures options expiration so there's a lot of someone going on\nAnd a lot of it's also going on is because Chad wise and thought what we're seeing in terms of the treasury ... to let's get to that 'cause that's at the crux of the volatility today\nYeah and of course treasury yields don't necessarily go for bad reasons uh and we got some phenomenal data yesterday we got a little bit of calmness on the Italy front with yesterday which may have removed a bit of anxiety buying treasuries\nAnd then we have their jobs report tomorrow and it feels like people are expecting a very big number a or the war in line for another blockbuster report\nWhich would can really tell the fed and tell her when they were sort of off to the races now\nWe still have that ... that there is not that much inflation right by the way the fed and teams are looking at the economy is that as long as the economy is it a fast growing this well even if we don't see a big pickup and inflation that that would justify a\nSeveral more effects from here and so the fed obviously very closely yeah listening a tomorrow what have you heard this week if anything and we'll dig into this little bit more later when we have ... and ... but\nJay Palestine out there are a lot this week that a lot of fed speakers anything sort of catch your attention in terms of what they've been saying well\nThe uh the comment from chairman Paul about how there's still a way to go till neutral so remember a they got rid of that phrase accommodate a papal does this mean they're already sort of a neutral and some people took that should be dovish but others thought it was more hawkish\nAnd I think chairman Paul is leading on the more hawkish interpretation that just because they got rid of the word a combination of does not mean the policy in their view is not accommodate of Wilson\nPrimary but I agree that we are not happy I think the interpretation of it was kinda like why wait what it was just kind of it's not clear\nYet exactly right and then there's a lot that there is an ambiguity as so another thing that people are they've been out you've seen fed officials really downplaying this idea like our star the neutral interest\nBut the fact that they're on certain about those things are I think the fact that maybe they don't believe they can get clear numbers should not be interpreted as dovish\nIs what people are listening to sit it got to ask you on the eve of the jobs report as you look at this market as you put yourself in the mind of investors or what should they be worried about what should they be thinking about either sector wise or like what what are they looking\nTo hear it really does come down to new what does the inflation outlook a port ten I mean it was just the other day that Amazon dot com was raising its minimum wage for a U.S whereas workers the Fifteen dollars an hour or so you know how does that\nPlay out in terms of not only Amazon but a whole lot of other companies to compete with them for workers you know especially when it's not like there are a whole lot of people sitting around looking for jobs at this point actually put out a short on my Twitter feed talking about the issue slap\nIn the labor market the whole idea of uh the unemployment rate relative to what you would call the under employment rate and that's getting a multiyear lows so it's not like you know it's it's a really a a kind of position where we're companies want to be when it comes it comes to hiring workers it's something that the president the Phillies fabric Harold\nI'm raising my hands and waving\nAround that had to Bloomberg at five AM this morning and I said why so many Americans still worked multiple jobs and a strong market and why would say that if it's such a strong market you don't have to work most of the top and you can find one solid job until I just feel like\nHe don't have to work most of the time they can find one solid job [noise] uh and so I just feel like there's things within this labor market we don't totally gap just saying\nOh there's no question is are absolutely confounded consistently by all kinds of things in this labor market where is the way to growth why do so many people on multiple jobs\nHow do we keep reducing two hundred thousand new jobs in America if we're at full employment like people say that's the craziest part to me I Love having the boys back in the studio we missed them All right Joe ... headed back to TV for what you mean is coming up at four days' Wilson you'll be back with us in just a few minutes for your chart and stock of the day All right let's get some more of\nThe national news and for that we turned to Bob ... in the Bloomberg eleventh Rio his are ...\nSenate Democrats are complaining that the FBI appears to have been blocked this week from a complete background investigation and the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh but on the Senate floor Republican leader Mitch McConnell says seven FBI checks turned up nothing on allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd it's far more troubling\nIt's called hardware hacking and what the story is ultimately about is a compromise of a company called super micro which manufacturers in China so us based company\nAnd subcontractors were basically tapped by a ... ... with the Chinese military to actually implant ships on super micro server mother board that were bound for America [noise]\nAnd so what does this mean I mean you know if you you had a metaphor earlier when you and I've been going back and forward than seeing each other across the news room for the past couple of days\nThe conveyor belt I Love that so when you think about\nAmerica's relationship\nWe outsourced basically all of our technology hardware to trying to long ago Seventy percent plus basically comes from China right\nSo when you think about it and I think if you really using the camera out what does this mean well this is a great vulnerability for us if China makes all the hardware and was able to actually do this you know and granted I Want to be very specific this ... and the story happening twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen\nAt the time super micro supplied nine hundred customers only as many as thirty according to our sources were were actually affected by this\nBut it had the capacity of being able to reach customers like the apples and Amazon's of the world simply by this was like uh the the first little lego blocks in night this gigantic\nA global supply chain right so that to me is the significance of this ... according to our sources this was a Chinese military attack and it's a unit within the Chinese military that according to our sources has been a noon issue to U.S officials in government\nFor a while and they've been watching these guys and this was something that was very sophisticated next level attack that they did not expect them to be able to do\nThat is out there right front and center what has Amazon sad what has apple said what has the Chinese government said\nTo you know one of the things that I think we're we can all be proud of working at Bloomberg News is that we are transparent mhm uh the the company has offered I'm I'm very ... firmed enough\nAnd we ran those in phone because um they have a right to have those denials published with the story at all it basically comes down to we had the utmost confidence in our sources\nWere talking Seventeen sources with direct knowledge of the compromise of super micro\nThese are completely independent individuals\nIn different sectors we have people in the U.S government US intelligence within a company insiders so we once we actually were able to do that and then over the course of this project speaking to a hundred more than a hundred people above the nature of this story\nWe we felt that we had it was in the public's interest that we make people aware because people are simply not looking for for this sort of threat\nWith the stakes that as they are right now is it you know we we published that when the story was ready but I think it's a really important backdrop to an overall conversation that's happening right now about sort of the relationship between China and America there's a lot of things that are talking about but this once you kind of understand this it sort of becomes a little bit bigger backdrop\nWell let's talk about that because you know part of your role as the editor of Bloomberg Businessweek as you look across that entire landscape you guys have written extensively even this week about\nThe trade war obviously some about NAFTA but moving on to China which is really the next leg in this put this in the context of you can for this global relationship this sort of complicated relationship to say the least between us and\nChina I I think it's really complicated\nBecause of what I said earlier Seventy percent of computer networking electronic stuff that we use comes from China\nTo their their becomes a bigger question and part of what we we we have already heard from the Trump Administration is that there will have to be new supply chains that\nCome out of something like this but you can also see that this is why tariffs directed at hardware networking equipment or perhaps there no one's actually said the reason why but now we have perhaps even in an insight into why\nAnd it's that balance between technology companies looking for an abundant supply that they've kind of outsourced and I'm willing to kind of play down the risk factor as a result of that\nThat they kind of outsourced and I'm willing to kind of play down the risk factor as a result of that\nYet exactly because this is this is the cost of doing business is basically one of the conclusions that one of the sources ... says at the end of end of the article we made a compromise there was a devil's bargain yeah a long time ago where we said we need these parts that are essential for business we can't\nWe're we're we're willing to pay this much that's how we ended up where we ended up\nYou know this is it is a troubling story there I Do think that there is a uh\nSome insight um that I think you can also get from it which is we reported and the companies have denied but Amazon and apple we're both able to detect this data so they had a way of looking for it and other companies need to know how to do this as\nWell or not to native story

already been debunked because it's not like Brett Kavanaugh never went to Rhode Island in his life\nLook I think that all all the so called witnesses\nHave either been debunked all contradicted so I don't understand the ACLU opposition to a nominee for the Supreme Court when they're used to be their policy is to not to take a position on\nOur mellowed out to the Democratic party today I'm arguing
