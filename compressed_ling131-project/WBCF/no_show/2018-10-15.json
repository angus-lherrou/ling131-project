meaning of Matthew some water or our plants and such so that we have war for drinking are growing so they're really tremendous benefits if we can get to see them\nThat's actually true send out he's the author of a new report from the un inter governmental panel on climate change that report calls on individuals as well as government to take action to avoid disastrous levels of global warming Dr ... says the public needs to become aware of the reasons for moving away from fossil fuels\nThere's another group of people becoming aware and that is investors Christopher ... he's going to go to guy when it comes to climate change he might this week about some investment opportunities brought on by rising oceans and warmer climate\nChris there is money to be made and climate change tucked us about that\nYeah usually I think climate change from an investment standpoint means investing in technologies in the future energy technologies renewables solar wind geothermal a new kinds of cars electric vehicles things that are part of the solution if you will if I wanted to look for something different which is\nIf you look at the data it looks increasingly unlikely that will control climate change\nWithout getting for some serious effects of extreme weather sea level rise cetera I I I got some indications from my reporting there were investors looking at the same way so I spent some time calling around and I spoke with fund managers around the country who said yeah they are looking at this not just\nIn terms of renewables but also how to look for opportunities\nRelated to extreme weather ah and I found a few who are willing to talk\n'cause I Want to get into that as an investment opportunity is that people are now looking at to play on climate change but just to kind of set the record\nCarbon dioxide and global greenhouse gas emissions reached an historic peak last year last three years or the hottest on record this trend is expected to accelerate based on the people you talked to and scientists are talking about temperatures terrorized by five\nTo ten degrees Fahrenheit from now to the end of the century I mean basically what they're saying is folks you may want to debate it but there's really no turning back systems will have to change\n[noise] yeah I think one of one of the things that's worth keeping in mind as you want to know what's going to happen on any given talk different topic to talk to those who have money at stake\nThat scare right that's why it's taking care of it was like you got Amazon into your home and it's probably not leaving right and you made it in to sort of another vector\nYou know it's probably going to embed itself there so that was kind of my thinking as I explore this one little bit further when I had some time I was like well okay so far it's Amazon is going to come in and do the installation for you\nThen why am I ... what's the what's the gap between Amazon does the installation and then\nAmazon has proprietary charges for you and the reason I say that is because it was a whole slew of other products got announced by Amazon couple of weeks ago as well and one of them was a microwave and I remember people chuckling about it but when I was talking to some clients about this I was like going to wait a minute\nI was like a microwave bits voice enable is kind of genius right because instead of saying I got a slice of pizza and I need to re hated and my ... my cooking it how long am I doing it for it you're just going to open up the device you're going to throw it and then they're going to say hey Alexa there's a pizza in there\nAnd I think that there's something waiting for this other kind of decision Laden high friction saying about charging up a car but Amazon can do I mean imagine you just drive in\nAnd instead of pulling out an ad which is what car companies would suggest you do\nAt pick out a bunch of different settings and say how long you're going to be home for and what not you drive in park you plug in and you say Alexa I'm not going out tonight you can charge it slow or you say Alexa I got 'em even Ninety minutes chop chop chop it up as quick as you can well\nIt's interesting that too as I think about electric vehicles and Jason I Know we've talked about this I mean what are the problems has been you know providing the charging stations making it easier making it more accessible to everything the system and castles been working on my can make\nKind of about ... more accessible to the general public hears selling Amazon who reaches so much of the general public and I wonder about is this the thing that finally ramps up electric vehicles much more than it's been\nSo there's it's it's the right kind of question to be asking Carol because like the way I look at it is\nAnd I'm not sure that he is different than fuel like I cannot get gasoline at home slowly drips into my vehicle but I can get electricity like that she got this whole spectrum of offerings\nAnd you've also got a bunch of consumer preferences and stuff but are plugged into it because it's something that sits at home all the time so that you know has the opportunity to plug into much say your prime account\nAnd all of these other decisions you make around purchasing in a way that traditional\nGasoline filling doesn't really enable you to do\nAnd so ultimately how disruptive or to Carol's point how much of an accelerant is this for the broader\nThe carols point how much of an accelerant is this for the broader electric vehicle market at this point now like does this help give it sort of a shot in the arm or or does this mean that other players will fall by the wayside\nIt's a it's a good question because I'm not sure that there's a definite like yes that's gonna make them market take off but I just see it as a series of moves if like shaving away friction you know you're just making one less thing that you need to think about along the way in this in this value chain of stuff you've got to do to get electrified transport\nAs far as who else should be concerned well I mean if it's the technical part of building that charge or you know I think that that's the kind of thing that will still be done by specialist and electrical equipment but who you're going to buy it from what relationship you engaging with wants that thing is inside your home\nAnd then also like what other relationships as a kick off when you go out and charge on the road and this is a another thing that I've been thinking about working on which is\nYou know the ball trick charging station of the future is very quiet because it doesn't have any runway and toss it also doesn't have any air pollution because there's no exhaust it doesn't have a lot of spills if something akin to more like maybe a park\nAnd you're there for different period of time you're not there for seven minutes suggests get gasoline and gum but you're also not every two hours I have a sit down meal so it creates this new interval of time and what could fill it up I mean it could be\nDifferent kinds of food offerings it could be an Amazon store it could be papa retail who knows but it just creating this new interval of time and the sort of new social space ten years in the future but I'm very curious about\nYeah you and me though is not just one last question too and I know you're right that deliver a new energy finance teams here looking at kind of the new energy face an alternative but just one last question in terms of all that energy I Am curious what this means for ... that if\nIndeed we can all of a sudden ... what it means for the oil industry we catch rained you know pretty ... I just happen to like ten years ago\nMhm [noise] so we've actually seen we've seen that exact move which is I\nAll of these spaces I've got all of this property ...\nIn some cases tens of thousands of gas stations owned by big oil companies and I'm going to incorporate a charging network into that so that's a sort of substitution of and points I've got the same space I'm just going to go put a charger in there and I'll still capture that customer relationship\nAnd you can see even in the way that the companies are messaging miss with the pay acquired a group called chargemaster it's has this sort of ... this mock up of what this future station is going to look like\nAnd it just has a you know an ice cube Morgan lecture charger in front of an American Spencer the back and it says you know why not get a coffee while you're charged head\nAt work so I sort of like for like substitution but to my earlier point I think it's gotten to the wrong way around I think it's more like while you're having the shopping experience or while you're doing something else\nFill up your vehicle at the same time we need to sort of reverse the thinking from a short term relationship to a longer term one\nI Love it snapple are always great to catch up with you thanks so much for your big sought exercise thank you\nYou don't think at Bloomberg Businessweek cutting out there are all kinds of problems with cash and credit\nThat it's kind of thinking what the future of money and he looked at technology to solve the problem this environment\nMine number care does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three\nPeople for for police\nAnything close to the restroom\nMiddle seat repeating permanent problem\nMy fear of flying\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with the digestive condition called ... pancreatic in sufficiency or eat PI even if you don't know ... you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBloating stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still heavy PI because not everybody experiences E. pi on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable suit don't keep a lid on it good why identifying E.

guys that you wouldn't have done anything like it as a mom and dad were here you know they used me while I wouldn't have to\nMake my theory arose Douglas ... David Cohen [noise]\nUm\n\nOh\nWelcome everything ... new again this is Douglas through the end he was the ... and yes we have a very interesting show today yes it is a\nList of first that was a little bit of a of course from the wizard of Oz what does the wizard of Oz pirates and Sherlock Holmes all have in common well\nThey have in common is a little zoo or I guess so yeah ... yeah it's a strange show because we we we have a we have a pitcher a new show that's coming on a\nIt is for a new show that's coming on a\nA way to for us to determine whether the show will be successful using all of the characters\nYou just mentioned exactly and here's the thing jak pumpkin had had gotten word when we had our show a long time ago when we were hijacked if you remember the ... yeah and so what happened was we had suggested maybe the two of them get together the kind of like the the losers at this point you know they were\nReally you know I wouldn't say that to know whether or not in the studio and you and I as\nThey were kind of you know trying to make their way they're just not it's not clicking for that but maybe it did they combine forces where\nYou're forced to take all this energy maybe it'll\nCome in and it is flowing downhill a little bit you know for them so we did introduce them they've gotten together and now they're knocking on a door with a pitch for a brand new show and the show they're saying is similar to what will be the new American Pickers you've seen the show on history\nChannel or they find a two guys try to find hidden treasures in people's like\nJunk ... archeology I think the calls it right off the hook you know and yeah so that so that shows been on forever now it's just very successful and those characters ignore every single request that the oldest do again has made to have\nThe two gentlemen that are on or even one of them from America pickers ... come on and then from Iowa where in Iowa all over the place and a lot of that so there are so here's a little payback to them yeah we're gonna\nWe're gonna rain this we're going to entertain this pitch and that you'll hear in a minute ah and and I I guess our and they don't know this yet but our critique of this pitch is going to be you know how do we authenticate the treasure that they find right you got to know what's real somehow exactly and we have a way of doing that\nCorrect so that's a little section of it so let's try let's introduce them now or bring them into the studio let them tell us what their take is on this pitch a and then we'll tell them well go All right let me let me questions\nI Want to guys jak kept very welcome aboard a\nPattern that get out gay or you're back to the accent as ... as nice to see that Gavin yeah I've got to stay in Canada you know All right and you picked up your buddy Jeff how can we introduced you to him I uh jak site here I remember Jack is this what we started to show the wizard of Oz theme he's from\nThose everybody goes on for a lot of talk what that's what I what I Am a man walking marital from the wisdom of ours what's always had this\nSo they're going to balls that finds these treasures and pumpkin had prices them um and that's the premise of the show\nAnd we said that's not enough we think would be better element would be ed and were able to able to do this now adding to this factor the a team\nOf Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson from the Victorian age through our cell phone we can Skype with them through time and have them authenticate these treasures that have been found by jak pumpkin it from the wizard of Oz of course and kept the bulls eye from everything that we got\nMakes perfect sense to me All right so as well and the way that we're able to ... you know contact Sherlock Holmes and Watson is because we were able to send your iPhone dug back in time so Sherlock Holmes has that we have another phone here and that's how we're able to Skype with\nRespect Sherlock Holmes is that this was docked election and I'm the gentleman is controlling this ozone gun if you heard live section this guy on the show like how do they do this but he kind of figure out this technology is not ...\nWell it seemed like he was pretty much blown away by\nThe way you get to the ... what was going to have a\nPumpkin had yes yes we well so let's go right now what is the first item first artifact you have captain balls act that you would like to introduce\nSome interesting chemicals that cause just looks like a piece of paper and when he got there like a photograph should tell us what so what this is\n... ... actually photograph\nEvery us oh that's interesting now let me take a look at that and it was All right it is a source or in nature in shape it's ... it's got a a it looks like it's a a a ... a background is that it's like a light blue sky and that's where\nWe're talking about oh my God I was there ... all ... clouds\nThat your phone fly in that among the blue sky in the clouds his right eye homes and watching them holding this up to the sky appears to the phones you can see this uh this picture here\nBy the way the clarity of homes and in Watson's voice over this iPhone\nMight sound a bit unreal because it's so good it's like they're here in the studio with us but it's just the the technology that we have here is really a cutting edge so so ... I guess ... Sherlock I guess Mr Holmes why don't you kick it off and what you see with this photo that you're seeing through Skype over the phone\nSherlock Holmes itself go ahead well saying that it looks like it's actually a ... I mean it's a it's a oh now I tend to find flying object there are things here in the Victorian age I'm ... images\nObject there are things here in the Victorian age um or images of UFOs quite popular now believe it or not um and this is the type of object or the the shape is very much in conjunction with\nHow we hear in Victorian England see us as so right off the bat I Would say it fits the image of what we believe one looks like so my first inclination is that this could very well be legitimate\nVoters or talked to watch and you know there's a bring a little bit of a reality into the situation you're talking as if you of oh those are legitimate situation we've never found to be legitimate I don't know where you're coming off of it is a show that those are great criminal mind and it's not one but it's an expert in the extraterrestrial I just want to lay the groundwork now you're\nQuite right lots and but I Believe in this case seeing these photographic evidence it to me seems to be weighing more on the yes it is real\nSide of the equation guys understand what you're saying don't take a look at this point it looks like there's some kind of the United states\nAnd follows a stamp bond is yes it does is it fair to say that the United States Air force corrects now what does it have for us this is the first thing I have overlooked by a factor of homes who it was an air force exactly I Believe if I were\nTo do choose it has something to do with the United states military I Believe it's in a branch of the United states military and has something to do with flying objects in then sell\nUS military understands moved to the military as soon as I started losing ... and soon we'll military organizations time seeing him is he doing that they are they doing with the right that doesn't mean that there is a time stamp there as well I see as time went on to two\nOh five Pete him if I could read that is correct is that is not correct\nDo of I'm right here on Monday on my my title is right up my entire Taylor Taylor monitor to oversee this time several United States air force and must meal I'd get a photograph of a yes or no\nWhat it seems adds an authenticity to it yes with the United states at a time stamp on it so I Would I Would say yes it seems to add to it's legitimate\nHomes I understand those presidents and certainly jurors dream is to do and I understand this when I I just have to play down to use it it's a military rule to religion as a as you I've\nGot is how does Watson I've very good and I was thinking of the ... and so I was confused for a moment that but I figured it out of it yes military time\nDoes not go by AM PM if it actually was in the afternoon it would say fourteen hundred hours not Tuesday and therefore this is a forgery ... a forgery wild done what it that's a\nThey'll tell you the Sherlock Holmes you came up with a solution here that is beyond is\nJoining us on I was the one that brought up put it this is a military procedure was Airforce his ability to reorganize like\nI don't know it was the one that the military ... when the world goes is Sherlock Holmes get the credit for every single solitary solution to every problem we're going to\nTell you what I think the ... I Can't tell you until ... missile lots of Dr Watson you man a letter of what's called a man of regular argument why does for a couple of a man of wire a letter of lettuce\nOr model that pose a ballad by mail about like pumpkin had real pleased him as a matter of mine and I got a good guy credit he he saw the movie I don't go to withdraw homes in doing that well\nFirst of all let me just say that it was Sherlock Holmes who actually solved from what I can tell the or the equation and and said that it was a not real and my question would be the captain balls ac what's the deal there I mean you said this was real and they\nHaven't had it all out of it you know not thought minutes every time is enough fourteen hundred and fifty now that I Know some generals and admirals that say using AM PM is that a lot a lot better\nOr worse I bumped into this I I ... in ... I don't know what you guys are talking about most of the time of the more foreign ... what's that mean that we're not\nGoing to you you go to twelve o'clock you see\nAnd then instead of going to want to clog you'd go to Thirteen o'clock until you get to twenty four hours and so this way you know you don't do the a and B PM business right and certainly on this photograph we can see that the time stamp is two oh five there for the U.S military would not stamp and the two oh five they would have stayed at a forty five so again poking at\nA balls I gotta tell ya it's not legit\nSite with a ...\nA year\nA A R R partners punishable wait until this moment by not so sure about this\nBut luckily you know it is you know you could argue that still did that sun goes down that's another one\nIs going to tell you a bump in the real word of advice for when you're talking about is the choices were you ever got a partnership\nIt really does it recently with the individuals take credit food critic who also be individuals or takes you know what I'm wrong partnered with a man let me say the wrong headed by the way it doesn't even go up and get them brandy firms out the problem\nI Believe pumpkin had Walton is right you need someone who's going to share the credit and I believe that your partner that the pirates is is really you know not being a stand up individual now I give Watson credit where credit's due and never icons so I Believe our partnership is much stronger and more legitimate ...\nCredit when I make dinner that's about the only quite like it I'm going to take a tiger and they're trying to get any credit for the strikes but I've never gotten cut it in these interviews it shouldn't lose I'm not and gotten good at any of these and also Conan Doyle representations of what goes on in the whole crime fighting is such a way this has just unfair\nWatson I think the real issue has that this this photograph is complete forgery can agree on\nThat I'm going to agree on that because I was ... and I tell you\nRight well let's kick it back over that to the twenty first century and see what's up\nYes I I think honestly I think we've got to move on to this was a a kind of a stumble I Would say yeah that for the ... but not the it's not a symbol for the show because I have a ... a man of the stature of Sherlock Holmes solving\nThese problems is amazing right through time how did he just do that he saw it right away and was able to like an instance lucky\nTo have this Watson holding up the phone to the picture and looking at it and and holding that\nThe Watson was invaluable by doing by holding quaint technician\nIn fact that we're on a technician like a little bit annoyed with this whole situation or if it's some of the mysteries we can solve and\nActual daddy from either touch Washington they'll get this Watson in ... I think\nI'll tell you I was I'm holding up their homes will come on at home as if you put it up a little higher there okay\nAll right so yes this this does seem to talk to me a diary\nOf yes George Washington's mother look at that Israel's or the pages was ready but now it says something here there there's a there's a script she signed something or indicated something on page three uh and it says the following some day my son will be president\nInteresting president as usual there's some day soon would we present no there's going to say those one who was born in Seventy and dirty too that's at her home in dollars is a huge once you'd bone Seventeen thirty two\nThat he was injured he was born in England right right here in in ... he moved to America heroes the Indian Wars if you're right where he became president of\nThe I have so Mr President as to what we have so the mystery on Wednesday nights exists he said you know this is a forgery because she was the first ... exactly\nThere's no way his mother would have predicted that he would be the president of the night it was much without any country right I\nKnow other than the frustration of how much time I really do\nSome guys I don't know what you're talking about all I Know is a show like home\nSo that again and again it's taken that long does it\nIs right to his right to the point and a lot to me if you hold that phone shake it like a like a tree and leaf and install them we're please let me put the phone down\nOr tell you the truth is is this dominant\nI look at this discussion is I just wanted to tell you this is a legitimate dietary I'm telling ya it says mother or what not that ... a ... this policy that whether he's going to be president of a ... she just knew that he'd been painted in some way I Do want to do with\nWhat the Girl Scouts talking about this unbelievable this is my way to conduct the tend to want to pass the old ...\nDon't listen to these guys I Am and I love replaced by I got\nVery minor by what was this ... this cat this ... this quote ... whole when what this was talking about whose ancestors were with what was that all\nBy Mr Spock from Star Trek and ...

L. S. booster rocket sponsored by NASA itself but also a privately funded moon rocket the Falcon Heavy\nBankrolled by a billionaire you on Moscow space sex and not to mention that she has a basis of Amazon he also was to build a moon rocket that'll take us back to the moon and then to Mars\nYes Mars is on the calendar for NASA by twenty Thirty years so we hope to be on Mars however\nThere's a new report coming out that shows that well a trip to Mars is rather dangerous because of radiation we forget the fact that well outer space is more radioactive and the surface of the earth so toxic can about some of the dangers about going to Mars and then\nYou can about some of the dangers about going\nTo Mars and then the Japanese scored a tremendous bull's eye intercepting an asteroid in outer space\nSo then the question is well what is an asteroid was it difficult to train an asteroid a comment and a meteor so we'll talk about the latest developments an asteroid science with Dr ken crumbs well\nIt will also get an update as to what's happening with extra solar planets and mysteries of the galaxies itself\nIs there a void out there\nA space between the stars and galaxies that leave us scratching our heads as to what could possibly Cosby's galactic boys so can once again when you could be on science fantastic\nTo be here Michele\n[noise] okay well the moon is the talk of the town I'm not one but at least two different kinds of mood ... and not being proposed to go back to the moon but first of all let's get some basic information about the moon itself\nFirst of all how old is the moon roughly speaking and how do we know and where do the moon come from any way or what's the latest theories about the origin of the moon\nWell literally is the nearest celestial bodies the one in Nashville body that goes around the earth or other planets out there they have many minutes we have just one but our motives quite big and it's bound to build and the earth\nAnd then eventually NASA wants to have an orbiter an orbiter not around the earth\nBut an orbiter around the moon to be used as a stepping stone to go to Mars so what does today is once again is trying to re can cross well talking about the latest developments in astronomy\nBut can we talked about the moon\nAnd we talked about is properties and the question is well is there any commercial value to going to the moon or is it really just a dead rock some people talk about helium three other people say that well why bother to mind the ... the euro uh what are your thoughts\nWell to be honest I don't really know what the future hold it hard to predict what's going to happen a hundred years from now but the problem of course is getting into space is still very expensive that if you are going to mind something whatever you mind has to be incredibly pressure to justify it caught\nBut again how can anyone predict what the cost that anything's going to be a good year for that I mean who knows what the price for the rocket launch the who knows what the price of helium three will be or or gold or anything else you would want\nThe line I Would also point out that every now and an asteroid passed by the earth and perhaps so\nAsteroids could beat line it's a lot easier to transport from an asteroid because the gravity of an asteroid is still very weak and asteroids contain valuable materials to but again who knows what the costs are going to be in the benefits just like to be\nVery far future it's hard to forget it's very hard to [laughter]\nOkay well we're going back to the moon starting next year the SOS booster rocket is already prime so that they can the Senate orbiter to go around the moon perhaps by the end of twenty nine teams and not to mention the fact that he learned Musk is not too far behind\nHe has his own moon rocket the Falcon Heavy which has been tested it actually it was launched from Cape Canaveral from the very same launch pad that sent the Apollo space crap going to the moon and he lost the Falcon Heavy right from there not to mention the fact that he's also now recruiting astronauts\nTo go back to the moon and eventually to Mars\nThere is a Japanese billionaire Mr ... who has paid who knows a tens of millions of dollars and he basically bought out the entire space craft\nAnd that's right to be asked are a new rocket designed by eleven Musk will take this crew of astronauts amateur is basically to the moon for a price\nFor a stand for we don't really know beast as her big our status for rocket\nAnd that stands for well whatever your imagination will carry but yes we're going back to the moon\nNow we're also going to Mars because at presidential directive said that the national goals will be the moon Mars and beyond but there was a story that came out just last week talking about the fact that well outer space it could be dangerous could be radioactive\nSo what are your thoughts about the dangers of radiation and out of space especially because of mission to Mars may have two years\nYes it is certainly known about for very long time obviously the faster you can get to Mars better because there are all this radiation you know from the sun all of flares and also cosmic rays from beyond the solar system and stuff\nAll it flares and also it's cosmic rays from beyond the solar system and so the longer astronauts are in the longer they always exposed to this radiation and I'm sure after all it's going to bars but also welcome much shorter trips so if anyone can figure out a way to get to Mars past two years I sure hope\nI share all the trip would be a lot faster than two years that would be a very good thing\nNow you wrote a book magnificent Mars so let's say if you think about what it would be like if you are an astronaut to walk on the surface of Mars first of all it is red or perhaps because of a rush\nBut what about the sand storms and what would it be like to walk on Mars given the fact that it's so cold\nHeated and he's very cold the atmosphere is very thin the sky pink rather than blue because then the\nDust from Mars gets up I think the atmosphere and you would definitely need a space too because there's essentially no oxygen in that very thin atmosphere the ... the atmosphere is Ninety five percent\nCarbon dioxide most of the rest as nitrogen essentially no ... to ... the first thing you would need is they spacesuit and you need to stay warm especially during the night when it gets down to typically\nMinus one hundred degrees Fahrenheit so it's a it's a very cold place though they're a dry place although there is I think the surface especially in the polar regions\nI'll start so he would add water to drink [noise]\nOkay now I'm going to Mars some people think that may be lava tubes would provide shelter because of course you have micro media rises very cold plus you have radiation\nSo what are your thoughts about using loving to to have a quick fix that is to have a simple way of creating a a a Mars base on Mars\nBut what sort of like the one place you could set up shop on Mars oh there are other places as well you would certainly want\nTo be in a place that scientifically interesting I think the canyons of Mars are very interesting to explore the little ... of ours are interesting to explore and you don't really as much danger there erupting unlike here on earth so there are a lot of great places up shop on\nOn Mars he would want to be close to water we'd want water beneath the surface so that would probably mean you'd want to land at fairly high latitude\nSo that you know a lot of rice beneath the surface\nBut ah yeah certainly uh you would need to occasionally take shelter from these global dust storm\nLars occasionally has the story was that not like here on earth which is just a localized area but the entire planet and get swept up in a dust storm in fact there's a picture Hubble pictures and I thought they miss that large shows a global dust for progress on the planet Mars\nNow what about the dimming possibilities of life on Mars recently it was revealed the fact that there is a liquid lake\nOf liquid water a lake in liquid water underneath the ice caps so there's that and give us the possibility that there could be maybe microbial life within these underground lakes what are your thoughts\nWell it certainly is that possibility anywhere you have liquid water and we get very excited only think hey maybe they could be some form of life their water is a very common materials in the solar system but most of it's frozen for example the rings of Saturn are made of water ice Pluto has a lot of water I\nThing that makes it worth so special is the water is liquid and Mars has certainly has water ice surface if in fact this the liquid lake confirmed that that does suggest that that could be like\nThat might have some form of primitive life that would be very exciting because it would mean that life and develop not just on earth but also on Mars\nOkay now of course the pot of gold is to create a primitive settlement on Mars\nOn my skin visions perhaps ... million people eventually living on the red planet however that means you're going to have to change the atmosphere a bit is cold is not hospitable and you have to begin the process of terra forming a lot of most mentioned the possibility of ... hydrogen bombs\nUm the polar ice caps to speed up the melting process\nOther people have advocated um sold her satellite second being down solar energy onto the ice caps to melt them so you think that that's possible again not in this century but maybe in the next century the beginnings of melting the ice caps so that liquid water\nRuns freely over the Martian surface what are your thoughts\nWell at the latter approached films better I I don't like the idea of hydrogen bombs blowing things up but certainly if you can direct some of the light of the sun toward Mars and and give it a warmer\nEnvironment and most importantly sticker atmosphere that would be wonderful 'cause you need not just the liquid water but you also need much thicker atmosphere\nBecause if you have a thicker atmosphere that can trap more one from the sun just as earth's atmosphere crossed one from the stuff that the earth is sixty degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it would be if we didn't have the carbon dioxide water vapor in the air we need to do something similar to that mark\nAnd is an issue that we're going to have to create some kind of agriculture on Mars some people think we can genetically modified algae so that algae can\nThrive in this carbon rich been cold atmosphere other people say we shouldn't perhaps experiment with different kinds of crops that could survive the Martian winters well let's take a short

once again\nAstronomer can cross well Berkeley rounding up some of the major stories in astronomy and science\nAnd one of the big stories concerns the fact that it Japanese successfully landed on an asteroid but first we have to get some definitions off the ground the difference between meteors comets asteroids and the question is what is the relationship between these three\nGiven the fact that media or sometimes come off the tail of a comment\nAnd sometimes an asteroid can become a meteor most of the relationship between these three\nWell asteroids and comets are basically leftover object from the first of the planet as a planet far solar system Mercury Venus earth bars and so forth\nAnd the media rights that are on the crowd ... from the last ... there are objects that survived the fiery passage through the earth's atmosphere\nThe meteor itself is the flash of light is the as the object is burning up and those asteroids and comets can give rise to media\nAlthough most meteor showers do come from the brief shut that comment\nSo basically asteroids and comets are the progenitor of meteors and media right [noise]\nOkay now exactly what the the Japanese do and why did it get so much publicity given the fact that well and that's where I was only a piece of rock out there in outer space but what did they do\nWell this was quite amazing mission they landed on an asteroid very small asteroids that's why it is about half a mile in diameter it's such a really small and they and then a limited number of lenders then over ominous asteroid this actually is so small\nThat if you will just stand on it you could actually jump off into space it's got such a weak gravity\nOkay and for the same reason this asteroid is not around the way the earth than the moon are they are on the moon are large objects plus lots of gravity and so they squeeze themselves into a round shape but this asteroid looks more like a cute and the reason we care about asteroids that taste twofold first\nMentioned earlier some of these objects cross the earth's orbit including this one and so we really want to know more about these dangerous to the earth and the second reason we want to know about ass right\nBecause they are the building blocks of the trash steel planet mercury Venus earth and Mars all of which consists mostly of rock and I are so we think that the earth far they as\nObjects like asteroids came together and it particularly to really like to know or the earth's water came from water is one thing that makes there were very special and we used to think that water came from comets\nComments after all do have water ice that's what\nThat's why they light up so beautifully when they approached the sun\nBut the isotopic composition of the laughter in common is quite different from the isotopic composition of the water on earth so we now think comedy is not provide or most of its water and instead we are now looking to the asteroid that may be that the asteroids are the source\nOf our water and so that's one thing we very much like to know about\nThe the asteroids of our solar system didn't they supply us with most\nOf our water [noise]\nNo well I mean think of asteroids me think of a large piece of rock Iraq devoid of an atmosphere devoid of ice it's it's a big rock in space but you're saying that perhaps these rocks delivered most of the water on the planet earth is that what you're saying\nI'm saying it's a possibility um because it's looking like the comment that has not been able to supply\nUm because it's looking like the comment that has not been able to apply a diverse water do yes\nIt's the current thinking is probably ask thoroughly are more likely source for the are smarter than the comment\nIsn't it also true that someone's trying numbers that speculated that some of these asteroids so I'm not really solid at all they could be a bunch of smaller asteroids held together by a week gravitational attraction and anyone who tries to land anyone who tries to intercept on land one of these things would be very surprised to find\nThat the asteroid is not solve it at all and well is essentially split apart\nAnd it means that one day we're threatened by a monster asteroid we have to make sure that we know the composition of it because maybe it consists of a lot of civil loosely bound smaller asteroids so what are your thoughts about what little we know about what asteroids are really made of\nYes that's a good point if we want to somehow get rid of an asteroid that's heading to impact the earth it would be very helpful to know exactly how it's held together [noise]\nOkay well let's take another short commercial break once again you are listening to science fantastically professor Michio Kaku\nGive us a

system you can temporarily reversed the arrow of time so the arrow of time port points towards chaos the arrow of time points toward death destruction collapse calamity however\nThat's in an open system let's talk about a closed system whereby you can actually make changes in the arrow of time there's a loophole in the laws that through my dynamics\nAnd that is if you ply energy from the outside mechanical energy from the outside so you know there were some people asked a question if we have the second law and my dad who makes on the earth then why do we exist\nHumans are obvious he's smarter than rocks\nSo if the if the universe nationally creates rocks however we created we represent a violation of the laws through my dynamics we are intelligent we can sing dance we can can I we can we can build atomic bombs we can build a rocket ships rocks cannot\nTherefore it seems to a an average person in laws and my dad I mix it violated\nNo if you add energy from the outside you can locally reverse the laws of their mind and mix it where does that energy come from da da da da dun\nThe sun's energy provides us with nutrient which allow us to therefore reverse the laws of thermodynamics locally that this means of course that the earth will eventually die sorry about that but that's the law of physics\nHowever it means that temporarily locally we can reverse the laws that that might not make ten bingo here we are sunlight makes possible photosynthesis\nWe eat plants that arise from Florida said that says we metabolize these class and get energy and that's where we come from\nThat is why we have evolution that's why we can have things that are intelligent\nArise from rocks so then the question or ask you another question what about the quantum theory so far we've only talked about classical ... that is a physics of Isaac Newton\nThe physics of Isaac Newton is based on the idea that every Adam is like a billion ball at tiny steel ball you know exactly where they had a dog is but in the quantum theory and the quantum theory this uncertainty\nYou don't know exactly where that ball is at any given time but yes even under the Clinton theory the second law that dynamic supplies 'cause we're dealing with the motion of large amounts of Adam's\nOn average if you average over billions at Adams the laws of quantum mechanics gradually disappear as\nThis is a reason for example why you can't be two places at the same time Adams can do that\nElectrons couldn't do that easily electrons can be two places at the same time but you cannot\nBecause you are very big that's why you average over a Chili's upon trillions of Adam's each atom being many places the same time and go here you are you have the illusion\nYou had the illusion that you weren't exactly at one place and when given time that's the view that Einstein had that's the view that Isaac Newton had but sorry about that it's wrong\nAt the quantum theory you don't really know where the electron is that's called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle this means also that you couldn't have two electrons that are in tangles that is a vibrate together\nAnd then to separate them there isn't a biblical cord and invisible and biblical cord that emerges connecting them so what happens to one electron inevitably affects the\nThem so what happens to one electron\nInevitably affects the other electron that's called entanglement now the questionnaire asked a question as follows get all this Clinton gibberish\nReverse the second law of thermodynamics and my personal point of view is no because the second law to deny makes operates on an average averaging over trillions of punch trillions of atoms were caught the effects are gradually washed out\nThat's why we cannot be two places at the same time now when I talk about his to audiences\nI mentioned therefore that our universe could actually splits perhaps into two universes because of the continent principal and then people asked that question does that mean that Elvis Presley is still alive in another universe\nAnd the answer is believe it or not you cannot rule it out is a finite probability of other universities being out there in which people that have died in our universe are still alive in another universe that sounds preposterous but hey that's called the quantum theory\n[noise] okay well let's move on to the next listener phone call\nI Know I mean it seems to be Iran ill one night on a hot nominee that we don't let her die [noise]\nWell do you ask a question that's in the news because of course the earth is geologically active\nAnd sometimes the big earthquakes creates a nominees which can destroy huge chunks of real estate look what happened to Fukushima\nIn northern Japan uh we had an earthquake or that erupted\nHot and many seismologist off guard created huge tidal wave which inundated the city and ten thousand people lost their lives this happens in Indonesia and the Philippines and the question that the questioner asked is how\nHow our two nominees form first of all there are two major types of earthquakes\nOne earthquake has caused went to a fault line sly horizontally passed each other like the San Andreas fault\nYou realize that San Francisco and Los Angeles millions of years from now we'll be right next to each other that's right right next to each other because Los Angeles is going north relative to San Francisco which is going south so California is being ripped apart that's called the sliding fault\nAnd fighting falls to not create so nominees so yes there's fault is underneath the ocean one falls we'd go north the other fault when go south and no sitting armies are formed at all however\nIf you live in the Seattle Portland area you have to be worried about the ... fault not to send injurious fall and the cascade of your fault is this something ... fall where one fault line goes underneath another fault line that's called ... and\nWhen that happens abruptly that means the floor of the ocean the ocean floor itself drops\nLeaving a huge gap which is then filled by water from the neighboring area creating a tidal wave so you can actually create and many tidal wave in your bathtub tonight\nNext time you and your bath tub with you Robert decade put your hands you're two hands underneath the surface of the water and then suddenly drop\nAnd raise the other hand by dropping one hand raising the other hand you create a tiny mini tidal wave on the surface of your bath tub right next to you Robert Jackie\nThat is called a tidal wave or it's an army create a bias subduction fall and we have them and they're terrifying uh off the coast of the United states in the ... fault\nNow we know that ... has directed in geologic time is by actually looking at the ecology of the Seattle area\nSome geologists had noticed the fact that there seem to be dead forests dead forest trees that die centuries ago many many many years ago\nAnd die because of salt water salt water inundated that area but everywhere you look there's no salt water and then he began to realize aha\nIf you are so many miles away from the coastline it must have been a huge huge tidal wave that sense salt water\nInto the coastline killing all these forests\nWealth will continue a discussion about earthquakes after the break once again you are listening to science fantastic

and can you imagine what that would be like first few thank God when everybody in your world is alive\nAnd hopefully that was the case for most I said there were Seventeen that died but um you know it's the process of rebuilding and ... it's tough it's devastating there's significant damage\nThat required all kinds of things for for people evacuating coming back and then here's the other part of

is kind of interesting I was very surprised by that except for that he has not completely set I guess that he won't run and how many times the run before in a in a race that if it ended up um Biden who said he's not running for president at this point what if it was Joe Biden\nAnd\nPresident Trump would that even be close would that be close I mean not in fantasy land and just to put everything aside and really honestly think about that for a second would that be a close\nA close race at all and I look at 'em I mean definitely has people who would support him but in a in a wider range of election when you're talking about head to head of the two of them\nBoy that it's he's Seventy five right so then you look at Donald Trump and\nAnd then you look at what's happened I guess economy wise and what's happened with the as we've talked about before what was NAFTA and now what that's turned into so he's Seventy four\nAnd Donald Trump is Seventy two so you'd have\nPut the years a couple of years from now add that onto it wow so a fascinating to me that people were talking about presidents that it would eventually be younger but it's the opposite of that most of what the polls are showing\nOur older skewing older regardless I think it no matter what is being said now I just had this discussion was somebody who is pretty high up in the Democratic party\nTo me it's really about\nIf the economy is doing well if there are seeing that everyday American the you know what's in your wallet all politics are local if all of that is going well and then you have an independent who could good decide one way or decided another way\nHow how are you swinging not as charismatic just the same old people that are being thrown up again how are you really running a campaign re feel like you have a really good chance to ignite a bunch of people I don't know how are you doing that to me\nIf I'm if I'm\nA campaign manager strategist I guess would be the the better title if I'm a strategist\nThat what I'm looking for is that the direction I'm going in bright\nI got to think now they there has to be some other way to there has to be somebody else has to be some other ... rather than going back into the pool for years later ... more maybe I'm wrong maybe it's the people are familiar with the names I don't know\nIt doesn't make any sense to me to me you think that there'll be somebody there'll be some somebody that'd be would be being talked about that came out of sort of know where if you want to think of people that have come out of nowhere a Bill Clinton would fall into that category Obama would fall into that category of taking Democrats\nBecause they didn't come out of nowhere that nobody thought that that was a possibility but then all of a sudden they were there right governor of Arkansas senator barely Obama was\nBut not a lot known about them rather than this long history of somebody that run a few different times it was that experience over unknown is it a

are there incentives for companies to stay in America that all that\nKind of stuff is plays into it it does it plays into how you'll elect somebody so if the Democrats are going about it that way\nIt seems so I don't know it seems backwards to me seemed backwards to you you might have seen this maybe you didn't the predators did a sixty minutes interview with\nLeslie stall and\nWith Leslie stall and he\nWas asked there was it was two segments they thought is that a couple of years that's a lot of different questions from you know\nAllies enemies what's going on domestically people in his White House you know that kind of thing and I'm now that we just had a hurricane Michael\nHe was asked loves this all asked him about the impact in what he changed his mind and is there really climate change and he said I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about over millions of years\nAnd Leslie ... but that's an eyeing it and he said you'd have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda\nAnd the other thing that came up on the one on one situation Kim Jong un\nAnd she asked um him\nDo you trust him and he said I Do trust him yes that doesn't mean I Can't be proven wrong\nAnd she said why would you trust him and he said well first of all if I didn't trust them I wouldn't say that you would not be foolish to tell you right here on sixty minutes he said the fact is I Do trust them but we'll see what happens and um\nYou know he he said\nOne of the things she said that I thought was interesting and his response was interesting is she brought up millennia Trump and her comment and an ABC News interview last week wishing that you didn't he didn't trust everybody in the White House and that it's harder to govern you always need to watch your back\nAnd the president that I feel the same way I don't trust everyone in the White House I'll be honest with you so that was interesting 'cause you know we've seen people that have far now there's speculation all over the place and then the Russian meddling ... asked\nAbout that and Trump said ... you know Russia wasn't alone he thinks China meddled too and other countries and Leslie Stahl said this is amazing your diverting the whole Russia thing and he said I'm not doing anything\nHe said you are so there was one of the awful cantankerous actually 'cause he answered the question\nAnd she asked the question is if if he didn't answer them the way she wanted he or she kept asking the questions one of the things that was also interesting she asked\nTrump about his the legs as president and he said he found a little surreal to phase president United States is that in the beginning he quickly said now I very\nMuch feel like ... I Do I feel like the president and she said and you feel comfortable and that was you know kind of that there were some of the takeaways that I think people will talk about from that\nInterview for what it's worth um you know these are the things that are that he talks about anyway over Twitter but just a one on one situation what um what the answers were\nTo you know more to that what were the ... the biggest conversation pieces I guess in that\nInterview and I think he I I mean honestly I think\nThat's good I think he should do more of those kinds of interviews if he is there's people you know from all kinds of different people in the media why not because he certainly\nKnows how to handle media\nAnd there's more specificity I suppose\nI'm not saying all the time but just do a couple of these a quarter even would be good especially if it's the run up to the election and then we'll see what the Democrats do and what happens with the independence day with a [noise]\nOne of the sea of radio\n[noise]\nTensions continue between the U.S and Saudi Arabia ...

going to know it's for guys because she had to look so different than anything else\nIn that I really just trying to make that connection to say you know hey listen if you walk down the personal care Iowa you kind of get a sense that everything's going dark and manly and all that with the men's personal care products gorgeous\nRecreating that and the cleaning products so\nI Love it and it you know

we want to make sure that I tell everyone yeah they'll for here a dash clean dot coms where you go but also a portion of what you make goes to veterans tell me about that part\nYeah so we wanted to be a company that you know obviously creates great products were trying to create a new category and the cleaning products style but we also want to give back and when the brand started evolving in the hero name and the star it just screamed military\nAnd so that when I was putting this altogether a friend of a friend was starting a charity called the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans of America\n... off and he's ex military ex Wall Street fireball I mean super super super\nEasy easy Energizer Bunny and he created this charity that really focuses on a lotta peachy as the issues that are very involved in a lot of the government regulations as far as the VA hospitals and he's one of those guys who's sitting in senator and\nHouse member offices all the time he was just getting off the ground when we were getting off the ground and we sat down we met and we have very similar views of our respective world\nAs far as disruption and there's a different way to do this and all that and it just kind of clicked and so we've been partnering with them we give ... percent of our sales to them and we bring them to a retailer meetings so for example Paul and I are actually going up the sitting down with the senior management of target\nThe few weeks to come up with new ways that they can help veterans that work at target and their gas that are also that so we want to be one of those

for America tonight couple of big things are hanging on my radar I don't know about yours but I like to say that this show and if you tuned in for the first time is all about what the buses in your neighborhood and mind frankly because there are\nA common denominator is the obvious one is always the weather everybody complains about the weather or they're excited about the weather fall temperatures nice Chris did whether in some places no in Colorado My pals in Colorado and sending me some photos from there but always when you get the first\nCouple of weeks now everybody seems to be pretty happy\nAbout that and then we're coming off of another week of football there's conversation about the NFL has you know if you're a team in my team and just like politics everything in between\nAnd before anybody asked me did not have a winner for now the score now the score this week will be moved to our Thursday into friday show Thursday into friday show and I will\nStay into friday show Thursday into friday show as I Will be in Las Vegas vive I'm not going to try to sing [laughter]\nViva Las Vegas I used to live in Vegas and um it's interesting always to go back in ... it's so different from what I've lived there I Lived there\nIn the early nineties and the strip was still the strip is you know what I mean if you've ever been there now it's so cavernous the casinos you could lose ten pounds I think if you just walk through like three casinos\nAnd you can't go straight down the strip so if somebody says hey I'll meet you at the other end\nYou're taking a new over a cab or the little monorail system they have because there's no way to do that you have to go in and out of casinos and leave your way through but some of the brightest minds from around the country will be in Las Vegas so I'll be there and I'll Bruce\nBringing you some of the sights and sounds of Vegas will have a jam packed show at the end of the week and that will include\nNailed the score I'll remind everyone of that because I hate moving it but we have to move it\nTo our Thursday in to friday show so we do the\nCheap movie reviews and we've talked about a couple of the movies there's one called venom that is making some noise so then I'm a star is born and then there's the Neil Armstrong flick bio pic called first man Ryan Gosling\nStars as Neil Armstrong I have to say I saw that the other one is just see it 'cause he's crazy about flight and space so we went to see it\nFirst man hauled in sixteen point\nFive million twenty five worldwide twenty five mil worldwide been North America six teams\nSo that's not epic but it's the first week a lot of times these movie sit out there for a while and kind of merit aid is different from how it used to be and then the money starts to roll in a different direction but movies certainly for the most part aren't making the kind of money that they've made in the past unless we're talking about\nSome of the superhero stuff of sometimes the animation that kind of a thing but stars born\nAdded another twenty eight million to its hall so domestically almost a hundred million it'll certainly get past that in no time so that turned out to be a movie that was well received or received enough\nThe Sunday night game and it's it whether they were fans of the team or not they had something to cheer about 'cause it was just kind of an exciting game sometimes football can be the EU neither let's put it that way so it is the mail bag and some of you did\nSay something about the gas I'm just going to go to a couple of quick one this one is from jak who's going to Kate I'm going to get in on that action I Swear they swear word I fall asleep I have crazy wicked hours sometimes I'm On the third shift but that's usually when it's your day off\nAnd um I listen to the show all the time I Love that I even turned my wife onto it and we love love love nailed the score I promise you one of us is going to represent the Sam on believable Sunday night game I'm certain you saw it I've heard you on the other network as well\nVery cool and I can't believe that it came down to a kick with the time winding down that's just vintage\nBrady but you got to give the chiefs credit they played one hell of a game and it was very very fun to watch that and forget about everything else for a while\nI'd how 'bout this one this one is from Tom and he says cake\nOn the misery index I have to tell you that my daughter in law has a house that I had the roof ripped off outside of Mexico beach who are scared to death\nFor um her and her friends and for others that we knew that were kind of in the the area but luckily nobody was killed and for the most part\nThey survive with their homes somewhat and packed all others going to be some rebuilding their\nAnd a neighborhoods are math I got to tell you that in a lot of different pockets that you would be\nProbably surprised about take my mind off of all of that I was watching this Sunday night game normally I wouldn't necessarily watch that because my team\nIs the rams so I'm always busy watching the rams but don't watch very much of anything else I get\nAll uptight about politics and then I'm focused on my own business so I have to tell you I did watch and I was so impressed with this kid quarterback from Texas where did he go to college he went to Texas Tech cut my homes he did he went to Texas Tech and\nHe was um you know highly touted but did we did anybody think that he was going to explode like this well of course any of the guys\nDidn't coaching him from the time he was young I could tell you what kind of skill the had but the boy he is really showing off\nTell you what kind of skills he had\nBut the boy he is really showing off those skills to that loss of the patriots just by kick forty three forty what a high scoring game and it's funny Sunday night games seem to be so close to the last one was all about defense in this one\nWas all about off and so I guess that's just you know the way it goes and it was a decisive kind of a thing and it was a game that just kind of\nHad championship Britain all over it so there you go I just move on to something completely different\nHow about this this comes to us from Julie\nAnd Julia Says Kate I just got to tell you I understand Saturday Night live and all the poking that they do Donald Trump and the administration I Know they always do that with anyone who's in office and the politics of the day but I'm just tired\nOf Alec Baldwin and it's our put states as it was but I have to say I'm a\nTrump supporter but I'm not offended necessarily by joke\nHowever this joke is like gone on too long it's just not funny anymore it's sort of like\nYou know when you tell a joke over and over again it's become a joke over and over again [laughter] oh well you said it I mean this is what happened on a show like Saturday Night live especially because\nIn it's heyday remember there were only a handful of stations to watch now it's I'm sure very difficult to get viewers so anything politically speaking especially in a polarized nation that's going to trip the needle in any direction [noise]\nThat's exactly what ESPN exactly what's going to happen especially to leave off a show it's interesting the politics of another note there are a lot of you were talking about the midterms and what did I think about the midterms will be finally see a lot of people come out and vote\nAnd I got this one from Barry who says Kate do you think because of all the vitriol between the Democrats\nThe Republicans the undecided then whatever you want to say what we saw with the whole Kavanaugh thing and what we see what the Russian investigation and just constantly every single day the conversations do you think we're going to see more people vote in the midterm elections this time around\n...\nYou know if you look at polls when people are asked are you going to vote and have you registered and they kept popping out all the list of ... when you had to be registered by across the country you would think that and you know my thing is this\nI don't care how you vote vote and then you can complain\nSo we live in a country where you're not getting shot when you go to vote if they're not stuffing the ballot box like I saw in Mexico's scared me to death\nWhenever shots that were above my head because we were with a camera crew and I had no clue what was going on between the pre in the pan east is but I Know that I saw that and it was frightening 'cause to me it seemed like such a lay up in our country it is to just go and vote\nAnd I think you you owe it to yourself to to exercise that right and I think what happens is for some people\nFelt that who cares I hate I hate what's happening I might have over anyone but that I'm\nBeing like that and not paying attention is what allows us to keep going down the same lethargic\nPath and then complaining about what we don't like there's a better chance you might find somebody that you like you might encourage somebody Iran starting locally and we could change\nYou know the game around but you can't do that if you cut consistently have that that attitude so\nI I I'm always hopeful that more people voted any of the elections and I hope the midterm elections bring anyone out who's eligible think about your own neighborhood you know locally what's happening in your state some important issues what's on the ballot it's so easy to find out\nAnd you know arm yourself what's the fact that you want to hear about\nAnd go and vote now\nThe latest poll I saw that Seventy seven percent of voters are say there is certain to vote in the mid term elections let's see what those numbers add up to be\nHow about this I got this one from Gordon he said Kato would you still do the radio shows if you won the mega millions or the Powerball\nWell that's like a loaded question because here's the thing nobody hit the Powerball jackpot\nOn Saturday he might want to go buy a Powerball tickets\nNearly a billion dollars are you kidding so if you look at the if you get mega millions I guess in the Powerball we're talking about serious money so the mega millions jackpot for Tuesday is the largest ever in the game\nIt's six hundred and fifty four million the mega millions is six hundred and fifty six million and um so the jackpot for the Powerball is going to be three hundred and forty five million I guess is crazy the mega millions record of six hundred and fifty six by the way\nSo I don't know\nIf I Won [laughter] if I Won a that kind of lottery I just you know what I Do I Know some cool people and radio that have had to really eked out a living I probably would do\nThe answer your question honestly I just buy a radio station right I'd talk to ... the N we'd syndicated programs whatever\nAnd that's the answer I mean I Love doing this so in some form that wouldn't go away [noise] um but all the people I Know that have been messed over in the business and that are awesome at what they do\nI Would get a gig for them and that's what I was honestly\nAt least for a while at least for years though right now what are the chances of winning like a zillion\nOne of radio\n[noise]\nTensions continue between the U.S and Saudi Arabia I man Carrick Fox News questioned the state of a missing journalist Fox has grown all Scott\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio said on CBS face the nation there is no question how important the Saudis are to American interests abroad\nSaudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy and they are a key leverage and hedge point against Iranian influence in the region\nBut there is bipartisan sentiment against allowing a multibillion dollar arms deal if the disappearance and possible death of ... which is linked to store the leader\nThe kingdom threatening to retaliate against any sanctions a state run news agency said the kingdom and turkey are working together to determine what happened Florida governor Rick Scott serving damage in the panhandle area from a category for hurricane Michael\nA I think both of these have\nThe makings of a good\nChampionship series on both sides\nTo fight for the right to be in the world series that you know the NBA is going on well yes of course it is and people are talking about predictions and what's gonna happen and what's the season looking like and all of that because this is the time of year that you do that\nAnd we we look at liberal on it's all about LeBron James and has moved to Los Angeles and people are picking the warriors still for the three peat so is it another Oakland title\nBefore the um [noise] you know before\nThe move or not because after forty seven years at oracle arena the warriors are going to move to the chase center in San Francisco\nIt's always tough for a loyal fans and you think well you know how far apart is that if you know anything about San Francisco where some of these big cities that like a world of difference\nPlaying at oracle arena versus San Francisco getting their all that stuff blah blah blah playing in Oakland versus playing in San Francisco it's all about stadiums how much money is being put up\nHow much is a taxpayer paying what is going on with sales tax what is the owner\nHauling in where should we put the stadium I've worked in places where that's been such a major discussion when I talk about the buzz in the back yard and the man cave that's part of the bugs because do you want to pay for it or not\nAnd a lot of times people especially if they have no interest in that why are we paying how can we have to pay more\n... and sometimes you really get jobs on what you think is going to be a good situation because you always get soldiers idea that how wonderful is going to be and then it doesn't turn out so wonderful and it just kind of depends on where it is I suppose the team and then what's around it\nAnd how easy it is to get in and out does it gum up the traffic in one way or another because isn't it all about traffic\nI mean what is what's the common denominator always say the weather is the traffic is one of them right\nFor sure the um work situation that's another one where you work and do you have hang dog look when you're pumping the gas and you're going to work and the person next year's does something and uh and you just want to get in and out of work quickly or is the opposite\nI mean these are little three major major bullet points for aid\n[laughter] but the arena when there's ever a fight over an arena and there was a fight over this arena\nWhen there's a whenever there's a fight then it becomes sticky and\nPeople get upset when are getting left behind the fan bases don't like it and then who's pulling you know who's paying for it and how are they pulling people in and then what happens to the ticket prices\nBecause a lot of times these ticket prices which are out of reach for the common than become a little bit higher even after that\n'cause they have to they have to charge up somehow and they pass it on\nA little bit ticket wise even if they have specials which especially in the NBA a lot of times they'll have some good specials and they do that in major league baseball I Would venture to say really 'cause it's such a\nCrazy marathon and baseball during the regular season it may be of all the sports the cheaper sport like when there's like dollar hotdogs nights or whatever to get\nCheaper tickets especially the team is doing well if the team is doing well\nYeah forget about it as some much different situation\nAnd college football a lot of people whether they went to college or not it's a college that's in there we'll houses in their backyard\nPeople always like to talk about college football and it was an interesting week because Notre Dame ... now is in the running for one of those semi final game so we'll see what the college football selection committee says but Notre Dame\nAnd the a P poll comes in at number four so that would put them in the range is the selection committee agrees with that you've got Alabama of course the runaway number one\nOhio State to LSU jumps back to number five LSU\nWith a huge win beating Georgia and number two really laying them college football to me is\nSo interesting on Saturday when you wake up and you

... the economy um\nAnd it's kind of thing it'd be really long running time between Saudi Arabia and the and the United states why the U.S resident um and the U.S had been demanding answers from Saudi

conclude\nVivian why is the probe itself\nSignificant [noise]\nVivian why is the probe itself significant [noise]\nWell I think that ... that it shows they are we thinking or reconsidering the

know potentially look again word I'm looking for\nAnd the story what could happen it could show that they might be perhaps ... willing to make some sort of partial admission of guilt analysts are

meddling in the U.S and the interview he added that he didn't want to send China's economy into a recession with even tougher trade measures\nNo although they're down thirty two percent in four months which is Nineteen twenty nine feel that you know I don't want that I Want them to negotiate a fair deal with us I Want them to open their markets\nAnd of course one of those possible tougher trade measures that the administration could launch against China is to label it a currency main ... later for more on that story we're joined now by Alex Wayne Bloomberg News White House team leader and our Bloomberg Ninety nine months studios in Washington\nAnd Alex what's her latest reporting on where the administration stands on labeling China a currency manipulator\nWe don't expect they're going to do that or we think they will pass once again for the ah let me counts fourth time in a Trump presidency he's had I Believe this will be the fourth opportunity to label them a currency manipulator and they won't\nTell us even if if they did a what would be the repercussions\n... there's there's no real consequences there would be a market reaction it you know that the the lawn would trade down I guess\nUh the the Chinese stock market my slip but um there is no actual consequences or it's not like we sanction China um or or or otherwise punish them for that it's that I Believe the law requires that we enter into negotiations with them which we already are\nAnd a file a complaint with the IMF for some reason\nIs the president there right in saying that the uh trade sanctions so far the tariffs and and and with the terrorists mainly have a really hurt the Chinese economy\nOr does it need to do the currents I mean I feel I think there's just no yeah I think there's something to that I think uh I think the Chinese are are so far um are so far are being hurt more in the trade war than the U. S. is I think that's fair to say um [noise]\nAnd uh any you know he's he's been threatening for a while I a third round of of tariffs on Chinese goods or he told us two hundred and sixty seven billion dollars worth of goods you'd be terrorists\nOr earlier in the summer but it has materialized yet and we keep asking why and he says things like well you know it will happen when the Chinese retaliate we point out that they have retaliated they've they've implemented counter tariffs on us goods every time we've done around the terrorists on their stuff um [noise]\nInstill the two hundred and sixty seven billion hasn't come through so it it it's um I think I think what's happening is that the White House does not want to uh placed tariffs on stuff that American consumers actually buying use ahead of mid term elections\nOn the other hand China has insisted that it's not using its currency to retaliate the people's bank of China governor or his his pledge that they won't use their currency is a tool of dealing with the trade conflict\nYeah and I you know I don't I don't know whether that's a credible statement or not um I Would have deserve the the one has slipped recently uh versus the dollar that would be one way to\nA counter the effects us tariffs make you're crunching cheaper major exports cheaper [noise]\nWhen it gets your analysis commentary on the um [noise] uh my potatoes sudden trip over to Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of journalists to come out because of ... says this\nRoad killer statement by the president today really got our attention it's almost as if he's trying to give the Saudis and out\nAh and it feels as if he may be sending Mike Pompeo over to Saudi Arabia to ah [noise] to help construct um a probably fake explanation of what happened um\nKnow I think I think that the Saudis may latch onto this this road killers idea and claim that\nIn ... I think that the Saudis may latch onto this this road killers idea and claim that a claim that whatever happened Nick show he was not sanctioned by the by the state um\nAnd I I don't think that's going to be credible I don't think anybody in Congress will buy it but uh I also don't know who here in the U.S will really challenge it you know I don't think that uh I don't think that Trump supporters and probably the American public at large much care about what happened to a Saudi journalist and the consulate in Istanbul\nQuickly are only only about ... minutes left to the Saudis were were vowing before today's developments to retaliate against any punitive measures\nYeah and so that's that's why probably both the Saudis and Trump want to come up with a cover story for this and and and sweeping away\nOh joy and Bloomberg News White House team leader thank you for your insights on all of that\nWere coming up on Bloomberg Politics policy power and law ... we'll talk more about the the Saudi a pledge to retaliate amid threats of us sanctions and ... and get the further developments on that\nWe'll also talk about Republicans shying away from touting their tax bill in this year's midterms coming up and just a few weeks\nBut first let's go back for a moment for a check on world and national news about\nThank you very much Peter turkey says an inspection of the Saudi consulate in his ten bowl is expected to take place later this afternoon\nNearly two weeks after dissident Saudi journalist ... disappeared there\nAnd the White House hasn't specified any the nature of any of the steps it may take but they range from punishments under disk they range from downgrading diplomatic relations or sanction Saudi officials\nTo you know where the drawing from an investment conference in ... so so tell us about the different levels\nThere is a significant rained as you've said in the president's authority to execute on the international stage is really unlimited even by Congress and so you're right everything from a downgrading diplomatic relations which seems unlikely\nUm which would be rather significant potentially sanctioning very important uh actors and even the components of the Saudi economy again seems rather unlikely all the way down to sort of even more sort of minimal\nSort of a statements of disapproval rather than actually it's an activity diplomatic statements a sense of the Congress these sorts of activities of course Congress would you rather than the president and really everything in between the U.S of course cells Saudis a lot of arms there to put a lot of talk recently about that we should stop doing that for various reasons for that would be a significant issue as well\nSo you mentioned that senators in both parties in both the Magnitsky Act in a letter to President Trump\nAnd what makes you think that sanctions will not be imposed with which you said with the Congress putting pressure on Trump in a bipartisan way\nWell at the end of the day it's still is the president's call so what's the Magnitsky Act says is that if a letter like the one that was submitted a last Wednesday Israel was received the president that has a hundred and twenty days\nTo do an investigation and to report back to Congress about whether or not one or more individuals on this letter is involved in extrajudicial killings torture other sort of violations of human rights\nAnd then make a determination as to whether or not that person or persons will be sanctioned but at the end of the day it's presidential call a hundred and twenty days unfortunately the long time from now and so who knows what the world will look like then of course post Mitt terms and all the rest\nOf their is crushed of the Congress can put on the president but the pressure is very much limited by the fact that at the end of the day that still the presidential hole that the Congress has only sort of indirect control over\nCongress has indirect control but there seems seems to be a situation that's quickly ratcheting up and the pressure internationally that pressure from news organizations it seems to be a situation that won't hold for one hundred twenty days will it or you will\nFor that long but we don't know I mean I think you're right if if it continues the pace of that has been the past couple of days I think you're right I think it's some something will need to give and whether that is\nSanctions or some other sort of response I I don't know but if more information is discovered it there's clear evidence of activity on behalf of the Saudis with respect to what happened in Istanbul and I think you're right I don't think it will hold and I think for political reasons if not because it's the right thing to do but certainly for political reasons\nAction will have to be taken what that is I I I think that will depend on what is discovered\nA if I'm not sure the rope killer ideas that district Trump is talking about whether that will be the the reality or whether it will go all the way up as some people have said with respect to ruin the Saudi Government is involved\nAnd I think that will depend on what the response will be will depend on what she found obviously and if the higher up the finding I think the more the title wave will will be pipe artist and be international that and then think Trump will be forced to act in some respect\nYou explain how the Congress was able to enact sanctions against Russia despite\nChris was able to enact sanctions against Russia and despite President Trump's reluctance\nMean to the president's authority to impose sanctions is an executive authority on ... like Hungary unless Congress passes a law to basically compel ... compelled the president and that's what happened last August\nThe president did not inclined to impose sanctions on Russia for any of the number of activities they're doing in Syria election interference et cetera and so Congress back in August at the new law\nThe countering America's adversaries through sanctions act cats uh which was done in a bipartisan basis both houses of Congress don't pass to a level but it's beyond the veto proof majority needed because of course the president could have just vetoed it unless you prove [laughter]\nAnd so it was enough anger I think a bipartisan basis enough concern and both houses of Congress to result in this law that pushes the president again even cats though even though that is a\nDefinite pushing the president's impose sanctions even that I think you would have seen\nVery limited sanctions actually imposed in August under that law and Congress was quite upset with that because at the end of the day bill is an executive action that that could that could it needs to execute of law and the thing that would be true here the president doesn't want to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia Congress to pass a law requiring the president to do so\nBut at the end of the day the president could potentially slow roll that or decided not to impose sanctions for any number of reasons\nAnd so the ... Congress has authority but the authorities limited by the fact that at the end of the day the executive is the one needs to execute that law as ... as sort of inherent discretion to decide how to do that Wednesday\nThat going against whom to do that I think so much Adam that's Adam Smith is a partner at gets in John [noise] coming on Bloomberg Politics policy power and law can campaign\nGroups are shying away from them as the mid term quickly approach to burn [noise]\n\nUm well for him so we're losing them today because the winning team went\nTo Germany are now getting caught up with the\nSenators at the gym in the long term [noise]\nUncovering opportunities for al ...\nHas the power to authorize with tungsten global lesson monitor\nPartner with the just the global investment businesses financial need to learn more in the G.

here in our New York studio out you know I was out Thursday Friday and I know it was an interesting market and I was setting up the losses last week pretty dramatic in terms of the equity trade today we're off our laws of the session\nAbsolutely in the market just sort of marking time it seems like before you get a pickup in the first the third quarter earnings releases that sort of jumps out on a day like today and beyond that\nI mean what's interesting is if you go through the main industry group so the U.S when the five hundred through just technology and energy that are lower at this point and everything else is doing just fine so\nYou know interesting to see some of the lack of direction and stocks at a time uh when when you do have sort of broad based strength showing up here\nYeah exactly right in energy maybe you can explain to some extent uh some of the news out of the middle east and some concerns about whether or not or you know I I our relationship with Saudi Arabia whether or not it's going to get worse it seems like it's softened a little bit and so you know we see that certainly playing into the an energy trade\nAbsolutely and the as far as the tech stocks go what's interesting is if you go through them so to start my stock nothing's down more than three percent so it's not like right out anything white the extremes we saw last week when yeah fifty five

looking at the trade you're looking at last week I don't know if anybody kind of changing their thoughts about where we are in the equity markets I don't\nThink there's any magnificent change I Do think we're going through the process of really questioning some assumptions especially with respect to profitability and margins into the third quarter earnings season and that's the one big fundamental shift that\nWe may be undergoing a nice I had a lot for a good reason right and you know it's just to me\nIt's a matter of resetting expectations in the short run not necessarily in the long run at least so far but not necessarily coming on done no and that's really not come in and done when you look at average earnings gross you're looking at third quarter earnings growth in excess of twenty percent still for a PS anyway so\nWhile that's a slower growth rate than we experienced in the second quarter still magnificently wrapping their earnings growth for the index\nI Do think though coming into the starting season you've had a month or three months really in which the downward estimate revision was much faster than a lot of analysts had expected right and that's just now catching up\nA ... and we're really starting to question okay so how strong are earnings are they as strong as we thought yes we know there are strong but as strong as we thought and that I think is weighing on sentiment a little bit\nAnd day we've just heard from a few of the big players obviously the banks last week kicking off the earning seafood\nThat's right and you know bank of America today sort of as a follow up and the story there is and it's all about the\nBond underwriting how that does this as a measuring up to what it also looking for it's falling off more than they were expecting a lot of that is that the companies have alternatives when it comes to wherever they borrow they don't necessarily have to go to the banks for that you can go to the shadow bags if you will so I mean that's\nAn area that people have focused on explores what bank of America down you know a little bit more than one percent ... even though I mean if you looked at the third quarter results there okay roses and what I was looking for you know in terms of the top and bottom line so\nI Want to go back to what you were saying gee do you know that people kind of rainy and their expectations I mean are we kind of you know are a market watchers kind of lowering the bar setting the expectation is a little bit lower\nThan they are ah we've seen revision momentum come down over the last three months in particular over the last month as earnings season that's gotten has gotten closer margins are really big source of contention\nI you know God only is it to a higher cost it's higher costs across the board it's high it's more spending as well so there is a little bit of operational risk and I think that that took a lot of folks us by surprise\nI think there is an acknowledgement that the sort of world of liquidity provision is also coming to an end here in the United states\nWe we're all waiting for that yeah we have been kind of waiting for it but it wasn't until we remove that a combination of word from the statement until markets finally said oh how actually now let's hear that's I think part of the story of the last three weeks is it's really us\nSort of knowledge ing it may be the world isn't perfect right we were very low price for perfection\nTo a certain degree the world isn't perfect things are not going to be smooth sailing a hundred percent of the time going forward I think there's some nervousness around the mid term elections even to throw out there I get that question a lot as well what is the impact of the mid term elections\nWhat about twenty Nineteen when earnings growth is only nine percent instead of twenty twenty five percent what does that world book like so there's a lot of\nOkay maybe things aren't perfect anymore\nWell it's interesting too and I feel like there's a fair amount of gifts that come on and have a conversation with us let's say you know I I'm now starting to think about in the next couple of years maybe it's a year and a half two years that we do see some kind of economic hold back and then of course that's going to play itself out in the markets as well\nAssuming that happens for sure you know of course you had people were anticipating it for like the last one I joined it before I ask what you can say about the sort of issues when it comes through a profit margin says gee is talking about you know higher commodity prices higher labor costs higher transportation costs\nThe effects of terrorists I mean maybe the towers are the relatively new element in it but we've been talking about those things were recorders now so it's all a matter of\nHow they actually show up in companies results and are they ah what people were concerned about in terms of the magnitude of whatever the profitability you get\nIn terms of earnings you need to do the comparisons become much tougher absolutely\nYeah that's a lot of the reason we go through this sort of downdraft or deceleration and the rate of earnings growth over the next six quarters is suddenly we have to contend with competing with two thousand Eighteen numbers which were very much corporate tax rate reduced\nUm and the results as you get single digit growth and earnings over the course of most of twenty Nineteen as opposed to double digit growth right it makes the attention on profitability much higher makes the tension on revenue I'm much stronger as well as you don't get the extra boost from corporate tax you can't get that natural extra\nSeven hundred basis instantly hat and twenty Eighteen it's a big comp to contend with what\nThey're feeling I was out Thursday Friday um and I have to be honest I was with summer summer where there was a great cell service or just kind of night it was like oh my God wow what happened to the markets um is there some feeling um and just quickly you guys I mean do you do the first day that there was some relief that some of the\nI don't want to say bubbled is if you will or or the excess in the markets was taken out\nI mean someone but we've seen these kinds of movies before you go back to January February had hit the right and all of a sudden you know things stabilize and you know they've come around we set records so you know the question is whether what we saw last week as another example like late January early February or something more meaningful\nIs it something more meaningful\nYet although I Will say three percent on land day should be respected those don't come around every now and they'd only\nWe'll say three percent on that day should be respected us don't come around every now and they'd only come around I fell off and on and the fact that we had a three percent down day does suggest that you're in technically much a week but much weaker position then you had been the difference between now and January also as\nWe've broken down to ... the average from a technical basis and so we may be entering a new type of\nRegime maybe that twenty sixteen to twenty Eighteen I Try and that was very accelerated relative to the ball trend that we've had since two thousand nine maybe that's coming to close by and we're entering some kind of new market with higher volatility higher rates in the like\nThank you both setting us up with an essay on this Monday Gina Martin ad on the back with these charges that Bloomberg intelligence thank you along with Dave wealth and our stocks editor at Bloomberg News let's get a check on your well the national news headlines over the bottom in leak out Lehman three own newsroom in New York City Hi, Bob\nSo we've taken a lot of that learning a lot of the exploration that we've done in the space back to two thousand fourteen and we've package that in a new business ... that's going to deliver institutional enterprise grades services to I'm a variety of investors that want to start allocating to\nThe south across town I heard you talking with Eric ... on our TV side earlier and this isn't about you guys setting up a trading platform for digital currency is is is that being a custody correct\nCorrect is we'll custody or safeguard are safe keep the assets we'll also provide a facility for clients who want to trade to access market liquidity so we will not be an exchange but we're working with a number of clarity providers\nAnd other sources of liquidity so that our clients can interrogate a number of I've been using the market in in the hope of getting a a good fell on their trays\nWe've been talking about the space obviously for a while here and obviously watching what happened with the digital currencies over the last year or so the run up and then the fall out but I Am curious if you get more interested about block chain and the potential for that versus the digital currency side of\nInterested in boats so back in fourteen when we started looking at the space we were focused on both enterprise use cases for block chain as a technology but also the future of digital assets\nAre in both of those activities still persist on the digital assets side we've turned that into a business called fidelity digital assets on the enterprise side we still at large team of folks in our labs group\nI'm looking for applications of the technology you know within finance and even outside of finance really exploratory at this point I even more fish\nAs far as the enterprise or the business\nTo business overall I'm just curious 'cause I Know you guys have been playing with us and exploring yeah\nSo the business was official we uh we announced today we were in the process of on boarding or first few clients I Hope to be live generally in the market an early Nineteen oh on the enterprise side we continue to experiment\nBut I guess that I mean as we are we in this cycle as we explore you know is it I understand you guys have an official business but I'm Wondering you know in terms of the market potential and what it might mean I don't know is it five years down the road can you do you have that kind of visibility at this point\nI think it's still difficult I think folks have been trying to make these productions you know next year will be the year of enterprise adoption or the year after right um I I think it's one of these things like many of these sort of network effects business opportunities that things are slow going and then you wake up one day and there's just a tremendous amount of activity right an eye on them and almost sorry an a ha moment\nYeah ... you know where where folks have enough um subject matter expertise in the technology\nOr there's been a lot of enough innovation where things start to take off\nAnd I'm not sure we're there yet but we do see based on the institutional demand for a product that large financial institutions are starting to think very seriously about this was an asset class which quite frankly is a derivative of interest in the underlying technology right the class itself as an expression of the value of the technology\nAnd so our our thinking is that if investors are interested in the assets themselves they're clearly developing a strong thesis about the use of the technology more broadly and find out\nWhat's holding it back at this point both at the asset the digital currency asset and also the enterprise\nA great question I think there's been a general lack of institutional quality infrastructure in this market um so certainly us announcing what we did today is important the fact that exchanges in other folks in the space are starting to move and develop services that dumb meet the needs of customers\nOr is important um certainly from a standpoint more clarity around certain aspects of the space would be welcome\nBut it's a wonderful push pull where the commercial side of this and the market demand is driving a lot of these things to happen so it's a very virtuous type a engagement right now\nAre you seeing as much interest globally versus the United states I'm curious what the the demand is it to as you look around the world separate and apart\nFrom fidelity is business and the space um you're seeing a lot of demand in Asia um a lot of demand in the U.S and and in Europe as well but you know I Would say the U.S in Asia are probably the two polls in terms of demand our business when they're going to focus on the U.S\nUm and I'm also curious because we did see such a run up and digital currency is towards the end of last year and then get into this year were you guys planning to come out earlier and then kind of waiting to see how the market played out or it didn't matter you\nIt didn't it didn't matter is yeah I mean I think we uh we have a long term view that this techno there'll be lots of types of digital assets issued native Lee in this technology so not just a theory I'm not just bitcoin\nA buddy of unreal world assets bonds and socks and you started to see that so a lot of the investment we're making now allows us to execute against this business opportunity but positions as well as the ...\nAllows us to execute against this business opportunity but positions as well as the broader ecosystem develops is there something about being kind of early mover first mover advantage to [noise]\nI'm sure there is um you know the thing that I like about our effort is that you know we've been doing basic already in the space for a number of years we you know we forget them playing with that sort of understand that yeah we were you know money be caught in two thousand Fifteen we run a number of internal experiments\nUm folks that want to find charitable giving accounts that fidelity charitable can find those accounts with a digital assets\nSo we have a lot of expertise that we've been you know carefully incubating and waiting for the right time to to release to the market\nIt's definitely a different environment but it's interesting to see kind of traditional finance kind of moving into these areas yeah All right well looking forward to hearing more um thank you so much for coming by thank you\nAnd I'm just on the head of corporate business development and digital assets ever Fidel investments that base of course in Boston
