fabulous prizes and\nThat's because chefs are always talking about how 'bout splash acidic vinegar is what elevates a dish\nAnd Michael Harlan ... should know he spent his whole career out chefs versus a cook himself and then it's a photographer and writer and he's made himself an expert on vinegar as\nHe's traveled the world for them he infuses them and yes he makes them in his apartment\nOr contributor shot a fever talks with Michael about bringing this restaurant secret weapon home\nMichael thanks so much for talking with us by doing thanks for having me see how to tell us how your obsession with the world of vinegar came about\nI think the same way most people make vinegar the first time a accidentally leaving a bottle of red wine out and open on the table but it kinda snowballed into a couple of other alcohol and had a leftover quarter keg that I poured into a barrel and it turned into the best malt vinegar I've ever had in my life so definitely a happy accident\nIt it is and now it's absurd obsession\n[laughter] now your book reveals vinegar to be so much more of our son the kitchen and we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nYeah vinegar as a flavor carrier is not justice overt thing that kind of\nPunches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce\nSo you know when you make a big red either two two one two or three to one ratio oil to vinegar um you're actually trying to express the nuances in Rome or independent or by carrying it in that fat\nAnd that kinda carries over and a lot of cooking process to use it de glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites and Marines uh it it is a really interesting part of cooking because\nAs overt as we think it is is that is actually about ah the balance and harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned baking recipes to react with a ... and says well\nOh absolutely that science experiment of baking soda and vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano ah certainly is kind of like what Irish soda bread is a you know using that as a full Evan\n[noise] what are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organize part of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example the vinegar that are unique to certain places and how they're ...\nTo go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrians\nExamples of vinegar that are unique to certain places and how they're ...\nI'm going to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but those sauces have vinegar in them have some kind of the city to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar in Holland days and most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving in Italy I just got back from a trip or in Amelia remind your region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original ball Senate vinegar which really wasn't export it to the states if not world until like the Nineteen seventies a such a small amount is made that a lot of people have and you can experience that so seeing that vinegar and contacts and seeing that his\nBarely used as an application where you heat it up to you know on top of the little aged parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes vinegar from single ingredients a tomato saffron red pepper a trucking Baron ounce listen\nAnd make the things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... an Asian cuisines\nAnd this was another thing that I had only really experienced\nYou know ... or ... counter American race vinegar the things you buy an supermarkets but when you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a there is so much\nExpression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and raise vinegar can be the same way there isn't just acidity there there is flavor are dependent on what kind of race they use and how much is polished down and on top of that you know the traditional\nRace in a coma zoo as probably the standard the gold standard of race vinegar in Japan but then there's up to sue this red vinegar made from the age ... and it literally turns almost black you know he wouldn't boxes before it's pressed\nUm then there's ... from the southwest of the ... province and it's black vinegar that's used more as a drinking\nIn boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the southwest of the ... province and it's black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\n[noise] happening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... or ... and vinegar but what some of the elements may be more scientific elements that give vinegar distinct flavors\nWell then there is nothing more than four to six percent of the the acid and solution and that solution is water so kind of like wind there all these volatile s jerseys aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're in calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with is he the guy said and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is\nOften the sensation before it's a flavor so you have that on your palette you you had that feeling of brightness of in life and then it makes you celebrate a little bit and that's when it hits and that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it it is a carrier but\nVery excited to start testing that\nCar and there are a lot of ... leaders now out on the market you guys have done a test of the best ones right\nThat's right our teasing and testing team has dove into all of us regulators that are currently out there and there are a ton of options for the home cook and they actually pick a winner which is called the jewel circulate her and it's small and it's sleek and it is incredibly

... challenged beautiful liquor writer and I was so jealous that talking about it my friend got me well I think a little ... the joke and then probably my birthday\nThis year it got me the phrase or a ... a ... it can make something with them\nA problem with I don't know what to make with them um I experimented a little bit I made chicken like look right there I made some ... that's really all I Know how to do and I would love to be able to use the more and show off you know if I guess\nSo you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal casts arm praise or about what size\n[noise] um I Would say probably either toilet fourteen inches pretty large\nOh big you know we got a big old oh cool and then you have some cats aren't costs which was like the basically the little mini brings it was right and how big are those are\nLike semi shape to her and I can okay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable\nUm I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more Neanderthal there so I um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread in there or like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or two for like a breakfast or ... if you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of blow heat in the oven to sort of gently bake there's just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation um but\nYou're twelve or fourteen inches sprays or another they were talking because that is a really fun to be the appointment to have [laughter]\nI think for that I Want to talk to you about in general I think that kind of pot does really well [laughter] so what I think his beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal brains are you saying [noise]\nPot does really well [laughter] so what I think his beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal brains are like you say as\nA cast iron so holds heat really well and I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that is that\nIt can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature and what that means to me is if your searing say you know\nShort ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you are raised chicken and you want to hear the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know it's like a nice sort of like hardier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but only like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like wrap it up to all the way I you know what I mean\nAnd you know get your oil and there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel seasonal um lame and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a more intense or like a deeper seer is maybe a better way to describe it\nAnd the pan holds that heat so well and it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it 'cause you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut it'll just really get that searing nice in deep into the cuts does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really get that would that make it ... and stealing or breathing are no longer not smart smart unlike say\nYeah and what's really awesome then though is once you get that really nice dark seer\nThen what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't burnt so then you continue to use that to a Braves like you say in this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using and it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on but in the oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off just server right in the ... because it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish\nA gift it's almost like it's one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave me this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect\nWhat a gift it awfully good one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect for both domestic\nTerrific well enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to tell you did All right let's now go let us know where you're making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not because they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants to learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles they turnout machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more out and say I'm I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do is cooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher heat\nBecause what happens is when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still zucchini and zucchini a cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen is you know the stuff on the surface of the pan is cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle isn't quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest is divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your pan ripping hot put in some nice oil maybe ... whatever you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them a quick tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can you cook [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your secret ingredients so let us know what are the things that you use you know that we might have never thought to use and we have Erica on the line from Seattle right now to tell us about her
