president [noise]\nThan just a few months ago I was so thrilled to see her first cookbook\nDebut on the New York times so\nSo how do I think so much for joining us\nSo I Want to talk to you about the subtitle of your book actually it's a comic American desserts so what makes a desert iconic American I really\nWanted the book to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood so for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had her on the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized pretty quickly that you know outside of the house not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie and as it is not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic because there's plenty of Americans who you know\nBorn and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that is so I didn't want to be a collection of regional desert so desserts that are important to some people but not others\nTerrorists went to the south of into your proceed\nLiterally millions of women from to go over our daughter\nOne moment\nProducers so at least we'll talk about this on a ship\nGreat to have you here thank you for having a valley so I'm\nDying to hear the story about this pilgrimage in India but first I Want you to tell me a little bit about ... and that that area of India\nYes ... is a it's a beautiful place it's on the southwestern coast very near the tip of India and its tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at this time of year it's very very hot\nAnd tell me about this pilgrimage ... what are these women doing [noise] it's\nA pilgrimage where millions of women traveled to one city to cook a dish together\nAnd that simplifying on it a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the home of this got us and her temple and a city called ... and the the trains are filled\nWith women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride\n'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually\nThey have a bad that it's filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ...\nAnd the entire ceremony\nRevolves around or adding to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up\nAnd what they're setting up our a makeshift hearth\nOf three bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and he set up all over the city so they're in how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nA year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nA year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the way that they refer to her is\nShe called my mom um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all this that this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as ... collie [noise] and um she worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\nSo set the scene for me so you were there and there's millions of women are setting up makeshift harvests with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking [noise] so on the morning\nThat this happens um women wake up very early ah they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice um\nThey dress often and new clothing I was told that women are often brand new outfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the bricks for the ... um and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until the signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then there are also volunteers running around and helping to light hard so all at once at the same exact moments all around the city there seekers that women light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking so which actually really incredible about this is the smell\nYou're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like burn rice and fire and coconut park and these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes\nAnd they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment\n[laughter]\nAnd they're really cooking so tell us oh it's a rice porridge yes so they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water they wait for the water to boil and then they have the\nYes so they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water\nThey wait for the water to boil and then they have this specific kind of race it's called Carolyn rice or read rice it's got a partial has left on so it has a ... hue and they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handfuls [noise]\nAnd then they wait for the for the ... to boil and part of the ceremony at the ... must boil over to satisfy that got us so when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over the sort of steamy was beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it so that the rice gets soft like any rice dish would and then at the end\nAnd they add all of the seasonings and sweet flavors and it depends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to ... because he is a a purifying a sort of symbol um many women as ginger there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nA what's called ... which is an honor find palm sugar and uh\nAt the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf and they wait for priests to come around this can take hours and sort of in the interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they rub each other's shoulders a nap\nAnd then when the priest comes they all get behind their hearts again they take off the banana leaf and the priest comes in scattered holy water over there they're pots and\nThen they're free to you and this moment it's so beautiful because it's something they've been waiting for all year this is a sort of symbol of feeding themselves feeding the gods feeding their families\nAnd they all take a spoonful they taste each other's pong dollar they feed each other and then they put the banana leave back over top they packed the pots away and they leave\nThe fleet such a beautiful story thank you for coming in

washing what kind of ...\nYeah I suppose there is something a bit counterintuitive about making the claim that an author most people have never heard of as one of the most important food writers at the last half century uh there were many incarnations of patients gray\nShe was born in West sorry in the south of England grew up mostly in the country although she went to to queens college in London and then the London School of economics at a remarkable experience during the war raising two children out of wedlock and lived in a tiny cottage owned by her mother\nOr through to the Nineteen fifties when she returned to London and took up a career as a translator editor\nAnd writer eventually publishing her first ...

F. K. Fisher who have far greater notoriety or than patients does and\nPatience wrote about\nA food and uh ideas into food that that have really become mainstream today so in some ways it's surprising that she hasn't better known [noise] you know I I still encounter people today who say that honey from a weed I changed our life and and you know that's something you don't often hear about a cookbook yeah\nActually the whole cake can be made over a few days the cake can be made a couple of days in advance the Patriot cream can be made also in a couple of days in advance so if you didn't want to put together this whole thing in one day that's fine\nBut after you put it together it really needs to refrigerate for at least three hours before you want to slice into it just has to set up\nOur recipe says twenty four hours in advance but I Will definitely as sit there for forty eight hours at least I think cakes like that that has some pastry cream and um\nThey're much better any kind of desert that's really has a custard and it's much better if you give it at least one day in the fridge love those recipe mhm Bridget thanks so much for explaining this one\nMy pleasure Sally thank you\nBridget Lancaster do decorative editor for new media television and radio that America gets you find the recipe for we can do is often by a slim [noise]\nComing up I can take your calls\nAnd leader more for your sweet tooth the greatest candy on earth\nIn France this land and this is the splendid table from a PM American public media a pilot\nWhat the controls on the new Boeing ...

so much and so so often you're like my brother you've been you've been here at all\n[laughter] well thank you I Hope to actually come to Ecuador one day 'cause it's a credibly beautiful but uh what shall we talk about\nWell here's a we live in a very hot place totally get it will be like a nor'easter like eighty five degrees totally sweater [noise]\nIt it's very hot and humid all the time just us really quickly we refrigerate everything and you know your fridge right things\nIt it is very hot and very humid all the time so stuffed spoils\nReally quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt no not so much because salt nature preservation but just to keep a dry [noise] and uh and so we we really are are very careful with a you know how we store things\nAnd one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend that just came from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of prosciutto was just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it come on a roll him and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk [noise] and so in the midst of the party at my wife says why should we cut the weight to sit and just just put it in the freezer for now and she put it in the freezer\nAnd it's been there and ah anyway\nWe have no idea what to do once we ... because we cannot possibly three pounds or ... before it would spoil and I totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing out speaking to my what pulled out of the ... is currently defrosting in the refrigerator\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back there isn't it [laughter] you know you've got the guardian not on the frozen per se you know I see this\nIs an interesting problem I Am honored that you would trust me with it I Hope it will fail you I have to say I never actually had to deal too much with a giant fruit and block before that's\nThe thing you know and a ... in some ways a a a blessing problem and I have to tell you given the fact that he was frozen in a home for either I don't know how well it's going to do for us meaning if you're learning and my my my questions to\nYeah you only give you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in an industrial freezer that can work because it freezes so quickly\nThat the ice crystals I'm a pretty small they just like ... and then they're they're they're in a home freezer begin to take a while but ice crystals start to grow and they and they started to poke through the cell phones and so you may find that in a week from juice\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be quite as um for more you know sort of to me that was before um maybe not as delicate that's sad\nTexture when you when you bring it out is not going to be quite as um for more you know sort of to some as it was before or maybe not as delicate\nThat said if it's not totally do frosted what I might think about doing is\nIf you have a a deli or if you have a deli slice yourself you know a deli nearby may consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen\nSo you slice and thin\nYou know packages or however many slices you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage that said the other thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when I was you know originally\nA fresh per se um but so I think about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask is cooking solution because I thought the same thing probably wants to get even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be just said\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around this piece of chicken you wrapping it around and the and then you can sort of secrets you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a salty cured ham if you're if you're not in a position to be able to enjoy it and it's sort of like\nSilky thin sliced a state\nAssumed since sliced sliced it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder even or\nEven just putting the singing the slow cooker and sort of raising the\nYou know I have never done that but I is I think\nRight where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey try and I'm\nSomeone in Italy with like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this to a procedure but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure the texture may not have all the flavor of all the beautiful cure flavor is going to be there so if you do that in a slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious um they don't quite salty so of course you you want to think about that one eating it you may want to you know cut up in the piece\nThat would be incredibly rich malicious\nI'm white salty so of course you you want to think about that one eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish 'em that of cooking the whole thing by or you ... you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hands that they do exactly that with\nIts cured it's air dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it indeed than you took the whole I Am and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out and you might save some of that\nLiquid 'em to use a I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze that and use that as a stock or is that a a flavor base for other stocks and then eat the meat\n[noise] you know I think I I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it or you know it's a flavor an answer for vegetable dishes maybe\nSauces and things like that I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a fish called potato and one of the things it's like a big giant stew and one of the things they should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like not like sliced bake a big square of it and to portray them\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so it kind of like that idea of like yeah different names you're\nCutting it in half and using some of it for chunks for added to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and
