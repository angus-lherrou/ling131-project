I think we're both in the same boat that we never knew her personally we never met her a straight but are both\nFascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\nI was introduced to her through gourmet magazine and it has an eat when editors publish entire issue devoted to the American south and they built that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by ms Lewis called what a southern and in this essay on\nThis Lewis positioned to the culture of the American south and the culture of the African American south in particular alongside the kind of work a day ... kitchens and also alongside of music and literature and painting and other forms of art and for me it was this incredibly\nStriking moment as someone who is interested in food in and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food with really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside\nAs someone who is interested in food and and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food it was a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nUm but I I had no idea who she was I didn't know much about the American south they didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and fell in love with her\nAnd it was many years later that I was working with a notice as editor Judith Jones who editor that also published\n... child and modern ... oh my gosh the list goes on ... road and and yes the diary of Anne Frank famously but I'm ... and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author is their English writing I should say ... and she published and the Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones about for work it became apparent to me that her book that you did with an S. Lewis was a real hinge points for her when she turned away\nFrom working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who's writing very explicitly about American cuisine and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that ... to attention and pay attention moment in into the Joneses career\nOf what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement a civil rights Vietnam War has come to end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective of an African American woman about the American south of rural Americans house and then through the perspective of home cook\nOn and it just I think for many people who've come across that it was this really beautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility\nAnd sort of ... when she only direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to jam down your throat um and you need it to kind of be ready to receive it an her in your own time and I think for a lot of people that come late many many decades after its original publication what do you mean by receive it in the window you food but came late [noise]\nWell you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a cook and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rates of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food up in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history and the American south and it's a really giving dignity to that culture as it's known entity in a lot of ways that separate from white American culture\n[noise] so I I wrote a story about loose a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up and and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I didn't think it before\nIt including but I think this idea of the face of the country cooking as being a political work like you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as oh just a sweet old lady yes\nA sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds of people ... and her her grandparents who the people who founded the community should grow up to them where in slave if they were fighting slaves at once that's right and I think if you think of that story you'd imagine a story that was one of hardship and\nYou know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society at the most beautiful community it was a life of duty literally children are singing in the book and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say hey whatever stereotypes you have of us\nIf you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine\nThat's wrong that's right and that's a profoundly political thing it's\nA massive corrective to so much of what had been written in what continues to be written that the life of the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture large series of regional cultures\nWas one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these meeting communities that were financially pour their life was rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it\nUm and and things that we think of ... still is a luxury food meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms in the forest and this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this one\nIs that we think that's sort of still is luxury foods meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms in the forest and this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was you know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves\nThey're ... they're literally making souffle is in their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fear ... to it too I think is so\nAgain maybe subtle and maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small topical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you started the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nJust move really incredible images and they take the bladders out and they blow the butter is up like balloons and tie them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later like\nCan you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally mhm and but also remember reading it and the way she describes the hogs after they've been slaughtered\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described anything hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man and a nearby community to hers who was lynched\nAfter she had talked to a lightning when asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you know this many years hands understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all it's ... [noise]\nUm and the reality of it I I Can't help but think that you had those things in her mind certainly um I don't know if you wrote them in that scene but\nI think that's what I Am a living with a sense that she was selling lynching and her probably you know that that there was incredible Frank nothing much present to deal with\nWhether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time\nAnd and that she was going to say it's sort of quietly and many people who knew her in both of her as being a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than needed to be said she said nothing at all\nBut if he was an open her mouth or put pen to paper it was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from ... um and then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can see that\nYou know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find out if you had a paradox and that\nAnd I think they're in life for ... yeah\nYou will find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find out you had a part in that and I think Aaron lighter balance yeah\nThank you so much that they might let our fantastic\nSarah Franklin the editor of Edna Lewis at the table with an American average\nTeacher's food writing at NYU and she's also working on a book on Judith Jones is Lewis is legendary editor\nOne of the Lewis is deepest friendships was with another ...
