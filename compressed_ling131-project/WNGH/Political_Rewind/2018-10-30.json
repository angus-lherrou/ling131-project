there thanks for being with us\nYeah great to be back with you at home in the Atlanta studio or we have Kevin Riley the editor of the AJC Kevin thanks for being with us today always a pleasure to be here bill and because we're going to focus today on\nThe issues of health care in as they've emerged in this election we're really pleased that we have Andy Miller who was a v ... editor in chief the founder I figure all the titles and the ad Georgia health\nNews and we should point out that one of the reason is Kyle is here on a on today is because in his day job he works on health care policy issues of for a think tank\nIn Washington and we're also joined this time in Atlanta by the AJC is Washington Post reporter Tamar ... who just literally stepped off a plane to be an Atlanta to cover the last week of the elections in Georgia\nRight ... percent down you're not even here in the crowd that the air force agree rather [laughter] I'm all\nRight as I said health care has become\nOne of the most significant issues certainly in the Georgia governor's race but also in races especially congressional races across the country it's interesting that literally in the minutes before\nWe went on the air I turned you a political on my ... on my laptop\nAnd the lead story is a picture of Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp standing together in the debate they did it at our studios last week\nAnd the headline says red state governor races could bring Medicaid expansion to millions so this is a subject that it's very much on the minds of Georgians as it is on voters in other states\nTo do Medicaid expansion that money would bring in three billion dollars in federal ...\nUsing the federal marriage a Kevin Stacey Abrams has been quoted as saying she thinks her plan would probably cost the state about three hundred million and she says\nKind of vaguely that she would pay for that through a a ... taking back money from a I think charity care in some communities that she probably has talked about other programs they could get for the money back from but I haven't heard much about that from her\nWell the best line she's had though right is the line where she said why if someone came up to you and said if you give me one dollar I'll give you nine right which is the ratio and and I think that that had sort of drives at home\nAnd you know in a way the Republicans you know from the beginning we're very anti Affordable Care act anti as they turned that Obamacare and I think uh the the whole thing got caught up in in that we're\nWe've seen a change in the polls right any I mean ... and some are where people were against Obamacare that but they were for key provisions of it and now that leaving shifted now they're ... in Georgia and more people are for our health\nCARE Act is more popular than ever before especially the provision for pre existing conditions that's always poll very well aren't you Americans so\nI I okay let me ask what I I I grant you it may be a very naive question Medicaid expansion ... what is why do we think that suddenly as many as Seventy\nFive percent of Georgians what Medicaid expansion is that like I see bumper stickers\nThat or give me a a very clear quick message if you expand Medicaid you'll benefit in this way or that way it is it is it altruism I Know you don't pull for this sort of thing Kevin but what are your\nYeah you'll better fit in this way or that way it is it is it altruism I Know you don't poll for this sort of thing Kevin but water ... why his Medicaid expansion helping the poorest of Georgians get coverage what's driven it's so high up the list anybody have any speculation about that\nI mean one thing that's been interesting is they I think people and you know I think things really started to change last year when\nRepublicans in Congress got very serious about repealing the Affordable CARE Act and I think people finally realize oh I could lose something think it's a little different in Georgia where they didn't expand Medicaid but when we talk about something like pre existing conditions\nIn a way that has been really helpful to my family and in my pocket back on and you want to take that away from me that's an argument you heard from Republicans when Congress was initially debating the Affordable CARE Act it's it's really hard to take something away from people when they get it\nYeah you know I'm a Kyle it sounds as if maybe that's what part of this is is that\nObamacare itself became more popular the notion of preexisting conditions which are going to talk about in a few minutes a suddenly became more popular so maybe Medicaid just rode along with their overall sudden increase in popularity of a CIA\nWell I think the other thing to add is that Medicaid does provide good coverage for people who are on it there's almost two million people in Georgia who are on the Medicaid program in the state and research that has looked at Medicaid expansion\nHas shown improvements in South rated health status having a doctor I'm an expansion states like Kentucky and Arkansas versus non expansions to non expansion state in Texas and you\nActually wrote a piece on just said subject on how ... how important medicate is for for ... poor people who with out it forego many of the most important health services that they should be taking advantage of\nLow low income adults and expansion states states that have expanded Medicaid\nThey tend to be reported to be in better health they have fewer on ... medical needs they don't skip doses of medication or versus as compared to these low income adults in states like Georgia that have not expanded\nI Want to go back a for a couple of more minutes before we move on to another aspect of health care to the to what camp wants to do because there is in ... another important provision that we sort of touched on lightly but I think we should help our listeners me for that matter understand\nTo the to what camp wants to do because there was another important provision that we sort of touched on lightly but I think we should help our listeners at me for that matter understand a little better a camp talks about waivers we mentioned that before\nAnd one of the waivers he says would be important to Georgia is very similar to what they did in Wisconsin which is a program that the feds would allow the state to\nUse some two hundred million dollars in is this is what we talk about when we talk about reinsurance I think Andy for people this would be subsidies for people on the exchanges the Obamacare exchanges right\nWell this would help insurers this reinsurance running around this would help insurers pay for really high cost medical care right in other words those individuals that may have a cancer or a heart condition that racks up really high bills\nReinsurance would have a pool of money for insurers to recoup some of those expenses in those high dollar individual patient cases\nFor the most important thing right that the waivers to\nThe anti air that it gives gives political cover instead of expanding Medicaid politicians are able to say well we're not doing it the feds aren't telling us how to do this we're going to do it in a\nUniquely George away or they uniquely Wisconsin way and away or could we talked about it before it came on the show could mean almost anything right\nRight it could mean the Georgia chamber of Congress plan which looked a lot like Medicaid expansion of course they didn't call it that they called it I Can't even remember what they call them but they they had work requirements for beneficiaries who would gain coverage but essentially look pretty much like Medicaid expansion\nGrade he has a waiver idea that's more targeted to uninsured in Atlanta ah and but there are waivers all different types that they need special federal permission in order to go ahead and pursue the night\nBut Kyle a while it sounds like it could be very important for people with high who who do have significant health issues that are paying higher rates because of it and by the way we were still kid into preexisting conditions at a couple of minutes\nThe waiver that camp is describing\nIs not an answer to expanding Medicaid because it doesn't it doesn't expand the number of people in Georgia\nKemp is describing is not an answer to expanding Medicaid because it doesn't it doesn't expand the number of people in Georgia who would suddenly be eligible for Medicaid\nThat's correct so there's basically two kinds of waivers that I think are central to this debate a waiver in Medicaid which is what some other states have used to expand their Medicaid program and then this waiver for reinsurance that we're talking about the campus proposing I'm Stacey Abrams is also basically proposing the same idea in this instance and so\nUm this waiver a squarely targeted at people who buy insurance on the Affordable CARE Act health insurance exchanges and bringing more stability to that market\nA man it is not a solution to Medicaid or it in my opinion it's also not a solution to the ... of\nHealth care in rural Georgia because this problem is just different than the problem that you're experiencing in rural Georgia\nUm before we get to our break we we are coming into the enrollment season Andy and so we now in Georgia have for insurers across the state if I got that right\nRight that we have for insurers are but they're not all across the state there are in different regions yeah but it's the same for as we had last year\nSo one of the things that's interesting about this as people go to ah to the website to the federal website to sign up they're going to notice what the rates are this year and of course I'd tomorrow last year when Congress was debating the abolition of a ca ... the warnings were\nA prolific that people were going to pay more and more money that the system was falling apart that ... your costs for being insured we're going to continue to increase that was a big reason they sold to Americans the fact that they should be overturned wasn't\nExactly you heard a lot of Republicans talking about skyrocketing ... and for many years that that was ... we saw that on the exchange it had that was pretty remarkable is that this year and at least two of our for insurance in in Georgia I mentioned that rates will go down slightly\nYeah I was interested in reading the Kaiser Family foundation report on this which we are to post on our Twitter account a Robert will will get that out so people can look at it in Georgia the ... the silver plan is a plan you believe we should look at a first and foremost right Andy\nLow cost silver plan is is basically the ...\nThe the silver plan is a plan you believe we should look at first and foremost right Andy\nLow cost silver plan is is basically the benchmark plan\nRight so people are going to pay a bit more on the silver plan they're going to pay about forty bucks more than they were if they had the bronze plan they're actually going to pay less and the goal play I think there are costs go up only\nAbout any ... about up to about seven percent so these are increases but they're not the\nSort of a terrible terrible crisis moments so that we were told by Republicans were happen\nRight here or go don't forget that we had like fifty percent increases in premiums but uh this year it's much more moderate and one thing I think we've learned is insurance companies are making money on this product now and that's one of the reasons why you see a little bit more competitive rates\nPool yeah and the other part about it of course is that I mean in the end it going all the way back to when President Obama you know push this through the debate was really about\nDid we have the obligation as a country in as taxpayers to make sure everybody who wanted health insurance could have it\nOr was it more look people are on their own it ought to fend for themselves and that sort of that new ... new government mandate government's not can't solve every problem and it was sort of those two debates now it's sort of really more than changed into a much more complicated situation um\nIs there anything else I'm trying to figure it I think we've covered preexisting conditions fairly well I Will say this is Kevin\n... and I I don't like to make the show about us as in the media very often\nAh although I did yesterday I think it's because this week I'm feeling a particularly the wrath of the president who seems do a lot of blame the media for what happened in Pittsburgh over the weekend um and I I grant you I may not be being fair to him and but it does hurt a\nSo here's where the media plays such a crucial role if you have people who voted against a ca against individual mandates against preexisting conditions in Congress over and over ... people\nWe have people who voted against a C. A. against individual mandates against preexisting conditions in Congress over and over\nWhere else are people going to learn the reality of that or the nuances and grant you there are some nuances in terms of the Republican plan here and there except through journalism guests Kevin\nOh I Would agree in fact one of the things that I Believe and I don't think I could prove this is that\nThe reason that certain that the idea of expanding Medicaid and the Affordable CARE Act have become more popular is because the more media coverage as a people have learned about things they become more insightful\nThey understand the issue better and they're demanding more of their politicians and their leaders because they ... they they understand the complicated problem better because we've spent so much time covering it\nKind of let me ask you a a this doesn't have to do specifically with the campaign and a promises and policies that are part of the election but when Congress decided to eliminate the individual mandate\nWhy didn't Obamacare just start to collapse that and why is it that the exchanges are able to in some cases reduce the cost of insurance this year in other cases make very small increases what now is keeping this whole\nProgram up and running well I think um [noise] it really has to do with their financial assistance that comes along with the policies\nAnd they Affordable Care act so it was sort of as a carrot and stick approach and the carrot in a help getting a health insurance plan if you have income under four times the poverty line\nUm that is enough of an incentive along with having health coverage of having a little bit of security and peace of mind about your financial situation as it relates to your health\nThose things I think continued to drive\nWhy people want health coverage and I think\nUm what you see from voters as that they just want you know that the part of some stuff to go away and for politicians to come together and make policy than just get this right\nAnd it appears Andy in terms of well Kyle is saying that Americans have not\nSuggested that they really want so skinny plans that offer them minimal coverage and exclude any number of conditions they seem to be going into the exchanges and buying\nThe full full deal\nAnd um all coverage and exclude any number of conditions they seem to be going into the exchanges and buying the full full deal\nRight and we expected a big drop off in the exchange uh this ... this past year but we didn't get it it was pretty close to the same number well over four hundred thousand Georgian signed up\nAnd uh I think it I think it is about preexisting conditions in the sense that just about every family has somebody in that family with some kind of health condition and people get that they get it on an emotional level but they also get it on a financial level if they lose that coverage All right\nWe're we only got a couple of minutes left for this discussion but as I think through what we have talked about and what what I have a neglected to bring up there is one issue that I have not brought up that I Do think deserves at least a couple of minutes before we move on today Stacey Abrams says from day one\nShe'll go for Medicaid expansion now she clarify she knows that she can't go in and inside that executive order establishing the Medicaid expansion she says she'll start working on it if she's elected from day what\nBut the legislature a few sessions ago decided to take the uh uh control of Medicaid expansion out of the hands of the governor and put it in the hands of the legislature with a Republican legislature\nUh Andy ... why does she think that she can get them to expand Medicaid when it's been a ... to so many Republicans in Georgia\nBut I think two things are at play I mean she told me in an interview that that she felt that there is that it's actually a lot of Republicans came up to her and told her that we wish we could do Medicaid expansion but the the political landscape uh there was another words the leadership in the state\nAnd I was saying no to it so I think she feels like there's more a pent up Republican desire to do this [noise]\nAnd and I will I Will also say that ah it could be that if she is elected that there could be a compromise with Republicans in the sense of adopting work requirements for anybody who would be a beneficiary these low income adults would have to fulfill\nThe work requirement in order to get this new expanded Medicaid coverage I mean some states have done that\nUh it cuts down certainly on the number of people who get the uh the new Medicaid benefits but uh it see it\nUh it cuts down certainly on the number of people who get the uh the new Medicaid benefits but it ... it could be a middle ground that she could strike with Republicans that could make it work\nTill things about about the politics I think what Andy suggesting on the work requirement\nGives ... would give the Republicans some cover that they may need ... Republicans who might be looking to uh to this to solve some of the states uh problems and then I think it would be more accurate to say helped me here that Governor deal\nMore or less a sent it to the legislature being having control of whether or not to expand Medicaid well what I mean I Know they had to pass the bill and everything but the message was clear that we're going to make this is hard to do is we can't I\nMean that's my point of by the way I think establishing a word condition might in fact when some Republicans over by Stacey Abrams wants to pass a Medicaid expansion\nShe better make sure she better be careful about that because unless you can pass it with all Republican votes tomorrow they're going to be Democrats in the legislature will hear nothing about a work requirement for Medicaid\nSure sure that they're still in the minority and it looks like they they will be even after they actually have political position that would play Ottoman right yeah I mean I I I don't I bill I don't see it that way I think it would be very hard for a Democrat in the Georgia legislature to argue against expanding Medicaid okay or they could\nPut it to a referendum and unlike like Idaho in Nebraska are doing and and give it to the voters does\nFall right um I we are pretty much out of time uh Kyle as you sit up there in Washington and work on health care issues for the think tank here associated with their anything last thing we need to address here with about a minute we have left\nSo I think the one I just add a little to this discussion on work requirements and Medicaid worker ... I don't think are a condition for getting Medicaid in a red state Republicans have\nAccepted Medicaid expansion in the past with out of work requirement\nBut um another piece of leverage potentially for governor Abrams over a Republican administration if you don't get through this next year\nI'm is a tax bill that passed last year and that cuts tax cuts income taxes in this state by two steps the second step in that tax cut requires a joint resolution from the legislature and the gun\nThis year and that cuts tax cuts income taxes in the state by two steps the second step in that tax cut requires a joint resolution from the legislature and the governor to sign that that may be a piece a legit and she looked at that time it really hasn't gotten\nIn writing could get some bargaining power All right let's see if we are completely out of time for this discussion Kevin Riley Andy Miller ... thank you so much\nFor being part of this conversation by the way\nIf you don't think that conservatives want Medicaid expansion we almost had never agreed with one of our favorite tweeters Ted bar field but tend bar field\nJust set us a tweet saying it's not a popular sentiment and tough to sell politically but folks with expensive preexisting conditions need a public option and not insurance they essentially need transfer for payments but he's all for basically\nThe expansion of Medicaid for preexisting conditions are I said\nWe got on the same page as political rewind we'll be right back\nOn the next ...
