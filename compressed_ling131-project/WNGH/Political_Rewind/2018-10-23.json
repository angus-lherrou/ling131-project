Atlanta Journal constitution not just some reporter not just some columnists like Galloway we have the editor himself Kevin ...\nWell that are out there really doing are kind of like leave it started off as it and read the papers are great reporters go out and do all the work right I'm busy taking all the credit for it but it's great to be here bill anyway especially with the folks who got in Studio today I'm really looking\nVia sitting right across from you is former congressman democratic congressman buddy Darden served up there in Cobb County area for a ten years something like that

there you go Julian times it is going to be joining us a little later in the show because we're going to talk about early voting either I'm particularly interested you know she's up there in ... county interested in what the early voting data tells us about how women\nAre turning out and what they're what they might be doing as they cast their ballots All right let's get right to it um [noise]\nI said that there are some breaking news part of it is this special session that you just heard a drew doesn't tell you about on the news break I'm Kevin the governor has called this special session he just couldn't deal with the uh\nJust heard a drew Dawson tell you about on the news break I'm\nKevin the governor has called this special session he just couldn't deal with the uh figuring out how to budget for the costs of clean up for Michael they're talking about it at least a hundred million dollar Seventy million of that might just be\nWell I think it ... that's in part and quite frankly I think ... had several other issues on the shower and beat as well or his taking on all the teachers they felt unfairly so his redistricting which was rather ham handed\nSome of the other things got him into trouble as well as the flag issue the fact of the matter is that that we had moved on and what makes the flag different from some of these other issues that we've been talking about some of some deals with history\nA and looking back a ... but but the flag in particular or as was pointed out by a by you're a person on Facebook that was something that was brought forward from the civil war into our modern times\nAnd and used as a symbol of ... of segregation Hazaras brown v board of education and other things and so that they are in law's a difference we can have a debate as to what statue should remain much that you should not personally believe that the Stone Mountain\nA carving should stay on their of something like the flag which has been used in modern times uh to uh to call for repression and racism that's something that we need them off into the history\nSo we're going to see tonight whether the camp people think this is an issue that voters may have to be interested in and see how they bring it up I have a project and\nI have a production I think they'll try to connected to this effort to make her seem radical outside or in other words the one way you do watch ... that's the idea is you were getting something\nOkay effect find um meanwhile uh just about an hour I think before we went on the air today we are\nSo story that broke in Rolling Stone it'll make its way into the AJC if it hasn't already become part of the ... a political insider Kevin uh Brian Kemp captured on tape audiotape in private\nIt gets way into the AJC if it hasn't already become part of the cook political insider Kevin uh Brian Kemp captured on tape audiotape\nIn a private Republican gathering presumably of his own supporters and um we've already talked to a campus campaign about this the spokesman there are a ... he doesn't take issue with the ... camp says on the tape\nOr he just says he can't be sure camp didn't say more because there weren't a lot of campaign people in the room so this is what camp said in talking in a private setting according to Rolling Stone\nAbout all of the early voting efforts that are going on in the absentee efforts that were going on let's listen to that tape\nAnd war is we were going to start voting was the [noise]\nLiterally tens of millions of dollars they are behind you get out there they allowed out of that money that they asked\nFor a number ...\n... her by a unilateral sizes way rival the one hand that allows outlaw that\nShow at Lindsay what became campaign says yeah he's telling his supporters the Democrats are energized they're getting a lot of early voters house they've got a lot of absentee votes now we have to do as good a job as they do and they say it's as simple as that\nI think it is a simple as that uh and I would totally expect a Stacey Abrams to be standing up and and whether it be a closed meeting or doping meeting with the press and say you know those Republicans they are are showing up and those Republican areas are and we got to get our people out okay and\nIn the context that we have right now\nWhere there are Democrats accusing the secretary of state's office of voter suppression effort where just this afternoon the ACLU was in a federal court arguing that a lot more than fifty thousand or early votes\nBetter ... Vance votes were cast were challenged and are in a provisional status now because the signatures didn't match\nThere are people out there who believe there's been an active voter suppression effort\nAnd this doesn't help because of the Republicans who want to say hey we want everybody to vote and we're not going to worry as much about you know things like exact match\nDoesn't help the cause of the Republicans who wanted to say hey we want everybody to vote and we're not going to worry as much about you know things like exact mad shooting and voter id and that sort of thing which is an an artful way of saying it so you just comment when I'm\nIn my view I think we've got to change our mindset owned the entire voting process and remember that voting is not a privilege is so right and when they have a right is involved every effort out to be made to include everyone Republicans Democrats independents black\nOr anything they're fairly young and what Brian how didn't\nHear anything the barriers in ... in what he said the ... who is of course\nThat uh he won't his people to vote and didn't well or the other side of the boat but the truth is\nEverybody needs to vote and uh they've more people that both the better off I think we all are and the more representative our democracy will come so\nI'm not offended by I think that shows you that not only are the Democrats are doing the very aggressive procedures what all shoulder Republicans I was shocked at the other day as well they should\nOut yesterday I checked out the voting a in Polk County and state of town I came back by checked out the voting in ... county and then call those recount it's not just happened to go by and the turnout is British people are moving people energized and these are ...\nStates raw wood that All right let me say Kevin uh I think here's the issue I mean it does sound like Brian kept saying let's turn out are Republican voters it will be interesting to see how the Democrats so Stacey Abrams may use is if she does in the debate tonight but does this do\nRaise the question of whether bright and kept might have been smarter too if given up his position to secretary of state overseeing the election and just run for office because in this tape how do we differentiate between candidate camp urging his people to the polls and\nSecretary of state camp worrying about all those votes coming in for the Republican candidate I Do think\nThat's the issue I mean it's a it's a fundamental\nA you know I I guess I Would say uh just conflict or something maybe the state out a deal with I mean there are rules about when you have to leave office if you're going to campaign for another office but in this case they don't fly in and\nI'll just say this I mean this that and other national media outlet coming in and making it sound like there's\nAll this craziness going on about voting I mean I get that\nYes I mean this is another national media outlet coming in and making it sound like there's all this craziness going on about voting I mean I get that it's a hot issue on both sides but\nUh I just thank God for mark nice ER reporter who's covering the the whole issue of voter turnout suppression and all that the and I would just urge people to read his stories\nBecause he cuts through the last word\nOr ... if I can make frequent and what's not number one in a secretary camp had resigned from office earlier and we had had some of these controversies regarding voter registration\nOr the ... campaign will be coming out against him how dare you abandon your seat when these things had to be fixed that's number one number two\nUh when it comes to these fifty three thousand or there's been a lot of uh inaccurate information about it and the ... campaign came out yesterday and showed that three quarters of the people that are on that list or on on that list not because signatures were wrong\nAbout because the Social Security numbers that were put on the registration forms or not the same ... or ... Social Security numbers are that these people have it in the system and number three\nAnd and you know the fact of the matter is a a you know people need to ... and and and that's what both sides of the campaign or anyway\nI take one last second to say buddy it's conceivable that Republicans wouldn't be under the gun by Democrats and the national media which of course has been focused like a laser on Georgia with alleged voter suppression stories running left and right\nIt is Republicans who a decade plus ago decided they needed to find stricter rules for who could voted new couldn't voter id photo ID when you go to the polls\nAnd they said they were doing it to prevent fraud but it planted ... didn't it for Democrats now comes back in a way to hunt them or as what might be innocent efforts to police who votes and who doesn't our ... our our interpreted through a more sinister lines\nWhat is Kevin ... says as an inherent problem here\nWhen you have a candidate and someone a part of his own enforcing law against everyone and I'm not saying what he's doing is wrong but everything you do just such back look at the bottom tremble a disqualification situation down in in his district and it goes on and on lookout whatever he does now\nIs that it's going to be a\nLittle suspicious of wrongdoing if I can get real quickly\nAbout the the id law uh the\nIs that it's going to be a a ... a wrongdoing can got real quickly about the the id law or the Democrats went to their favorite federal judge ... Murphy the judge up from back in two thousand Seventy thousand eight\nTo claim that the ID laws were a worst voter suppression and judge Murphy in a very extensive border\nFound no evidence to support that allegation is okay I take your point and\nYou got the last word in this segment you could have easily now so could all of you were going to take a quick break and come right back on political rewind Julie Thompson there'll be joining us when we do [noise]\nYou know selling a car can be a hassle but donate again as a whole different story let us take off your hands off your driveway and turn it in the public radio and maybe even a tax deductions to resolve the host of marketplace here is how to do [noise]\nAll eight seven seven GP beat one car or donate securely online at ... dot org slash cars ten thanks [noise]\nAll right so we're going to watch what you're gonna stay with us for the next few minutes ... oh yeah yeah I I Love that up because\nKevin a town house wants to know if you will clarify did you cast a provisional ballot and they were going to check your address or did they just accept it up to my really boy Arab Utah and everything is\nMaking news here but everything\nIn my address except the number the street and I am I on the street right ZIP Code was right everything was right\nWhen I Would suggest that had not been Kevin Kevin rally had been some other person in some other jurisdiction you may well have been denied that right to vote you are strong enough to insist on your position but most people would not have shown that kind of moxie that uh you demonstrated when you said that you'd be entitled to both well\nLet me also add that that you know as a Republican laundry would say one thing she did say you show up at the polls and you insist on your right to vote on some someone says no you keep insisting that\nYou know as a Republican I'm agreeing with say say but the one thing\nShe did say you show up at the polls and you insist on your right to vote on some someone says no you keep insisting that end of it on the worst things about this ... and ... and ... what I Want to emphasize those fifty thousand people you can vote and they said that and I hope you do\nAnd so does a good Republican\nAll right well I started to say let's get another break out of the way we all continue the conversation Julie I'm Glad you can stay with us on the phone or Kevin I'm Glad you're here buddy Darden and as Lindsey will continue with all of you after this\nNext fresh air voting rights and voting restriction they kept with Ari Berman author and give us the ballot twenty four states have implemented new restrictions disproportionately affecting minorities\nRanging from requiring voter id is closing polling places also tell us about the seven states or Africa are being made to expand voting rights China\nShares this afternoon at three ... and the b._b._c. news dot org\nAh we're back um you know I ... every now and then\nWith an issue like either of the Abrams Confederate flag burning or a camp are urging people the Republicans they'd better vote because Democrats sure well\nI I Do there's this little piece of music feels guilty because those in some ways are distractions buddy from the bigger issues that face this state and that the can't canes themselves a lot of talk about so that in mind let's do a little reset here we have a debate tonight\nUm what are the issues if you were a panelist tonight one of the reporters on the panel what do you want to hear in the way of issues from Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp what issues do you think they are most likely to highlight and I'm gonna go round and ask each of you that question\nDemocrats a will emphasize healthcare because the state of Georgia we all know we're all going about twelve billion dollars in federal money cents C. A. C. H. came on and Georgia has an agree just record a in so far has\nA number of inch uninsured people we had that would be one to our public schools are specially in areas of southwest Georgia and\nAnd uh in the central Georgia need need strong attention and that is a state wide concern of great great and finally finally\nNo in the central Georgia need need strong attention and that's just a state wide concern of great great and finally finally public safety is always got to be an issue though because that's the job was like God what am I in my opinion just educate educate the people who got good health care\nAnd to see that they are properly protect shallow free or you're in law enforcement education and and of course they don't care\nFor Kevin uh Stacey Abrams has a focus a very very intense sleep on expanding Medicaid it seems to be a pretty popular issue across the state of Georgia Brian Kemp\nOr doesn't think it's a good idea thinks it will end up costing the state too much money a but there's no question this is going to be somebody she'll talk about tonight right\nI Would be shocked if she doesn't find a way to talk about it when the first questions he's asked no matter what the question is\nBecause she has really taken that tact of ... you know expanding Medicaid is the simple straightforward way to do things but the what she's really emphasizes made for healthcare rural hospitals all that kind of stuff that I think for average people\nUnderstand that they understand preexisting conditions they don't understand their hospital closing a expanding Medicaid sounds like big government and I think a lot of people\nLess attracted to that kind of terminology but everybody from the moment Obamacare passed the most popular feature has always been coverage of pre existing conditions everybody can agree on that\nJulian if you were giving household or Brian Kemp before the debate what would you tell them he should focus on a most intensely\nWell first of all I I Would tell him to focus on what he is going to do to strengthen the economy and help job creation and the private sector um I agree with that either had access to quality health care and education\nAre definitely top ... issues with with everyone and the public safety issue is\nExtremely important and also how that factors in to education and if I were advising by and can't\nI Would tell him to definitely focus on what he plans to do in schools\nAnd not only with getting that thirty thousand dollars and to start out as security to strengthen security in schools but also the five thousand dollar a teacher raises and how that is going to attract and retain quality teachers so ed\nAnd it's called but also that five thousand dollar a teacher raise those and how that is going to attract and retain quality teachers\nSo ad that I'm Glad you mentioned education you know we already know that Medicaid expansion or as ... as the new vouchers for health care which is the way he has explained to\nAs I understand it while you're building ... waivers rather I meant waivers vouchers\nThey help people who are on the exchanges and wanted to save money and they're not much there not much good for people who need healthcare don't habits that should be out of right and that's education\nA RINO Abrams is all in for public education she wants to take away the hundred million dollars the legislature now is put in place a for scholarships for students to go to private schools and camp in fact wants to expand the opportunity for people to go to alternative to a A R D well turn it into\nA public school so it can be interesting to see how that plays it\nIt it will be an interesting contrast and ah you know when it comes to public education or if if I was camp or an ... advisors I Do too thanks number one is that ... I'd had healthcare head on first\nOr the fact of the matter is a Medicaid ah waivers to give states more flexibility and taking care of the the least among us is something that works worked in Arkansas it's working in Indiana and other places it up I was him I'd come straight out of the box and say look\nYou've got a one size fits all I Want to come up with the Georgia plan to to make health care better for all Georgians and this is what I'm going to do so I take that that away from her from day one\nNumber two is on education\nYou know I'd hit her on the fact that that she's talking a about continuing a an education system that's a hundred years old and he wants to look at an education system that works for all Georgians in the twenty first century through graduate school choice she's not only against uh the the the the teacher\nBy the ... the student a scholarship program but she's also against charter schools she'd been very\nVocal opponent of the state charter school system which had been a very successful program and was voted for overwhelmingly by the people George in two thousand twelve and so I'd come after her\nOn her order inability to go after school reform to basically a improve the quality of education and I'd come straight out of the box and talk about my plan on health care when it comes to helping in particular rural areas those are my two things that hit on we all know that the key to the to the night for both candidates is not to say something done much do\nAnd are not even ...\nYou think that hit on we all know that the key to the to the night for both Kansas is not to say something dumb stupid and are not\nEven Russ under show yeah yeah that's the only had him on that you can learn and you can lose it\nTonight but you can't win it and I don't think that many votes they're going to be changed however a if a person made an incorrect all police you saw a dumb or stupid statement that might that was more likely\nTo me that you think I mean I I I agree with you I had a friend of mine who studied debates for years ... always used to say that debates don't change anyone's mind that you go into the debate you ... Canada and when they won and people are undecided aren't watching anyway\nWell I think you're you're right in terms of but you don't you can't ... some of the some of the smartest people I've ever known have gotten into a debate and they get themselves caught up in the fact how smart they are Roy Barnes who's one of the smartest politician we've seen in this state\nSaid something that was probably accurate in a debate but he said it in such a way that was cold at ... palace in sounding and that's when he said children die all the time who are in a state system\nA and you know I Know what he meant by it but that's what he said and and his opponents beat him over the head and two thousand to ... hours there and it was a rotten egg right here when when he said and uh\nOf course obviously he should've qualified it and uh but what he said was absolutely true but we all know that people don't want to hear it in such a catalog and what they consider on the lean way but if I can give you one other thing really ever given in terms of a question and this was a voucher reporters\nIt'd be real interesting to hear this answer\nA Amazon is still looking at us for you or a governor and Amazon came to you wanting to close the deal what would you propose that would be an interesting question\nAll right ah I'm not on the panel I don't I frankly don't even know who is and I should I Apologize for that but that isn't a bad question Julie and I want to go back to something you said", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "23"}
