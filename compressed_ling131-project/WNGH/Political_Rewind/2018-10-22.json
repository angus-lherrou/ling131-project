Michael the c._e._o. or a of the Georgia forestry ... association says that the University of Georgia study shows that the states working for us is taxed three times higher than in neighboring states with four point seven million acres tax rate about six times\nHigher so this is an effort to continue to keep the taxes on the timber farmers are ... to a\nLower rate yeah and I mean I've seen this firsthand traveling down to corporate county some other places in in South Georgia where you know as far as I could see this lonely pines in his in his in his a full blown industry right it's not just land I mean you you really have to be more its crops\nAll right I Do think I Would urge you all if the Google this one a ... because you're smart voters out there we know you are you may want to do a little bit more research on this timber tax and see what you say number four is the crime victims Rights Amendment\nIt's also been known across the country have as much as it use law what does it\nDo a ... law actually kind of caught if I was in the constitution right or the idea that victims have arise you already have certain noticed rising\nOh what is it do it ... law actually kind of caught if I was in the constitution right the idea that victims have arise you already have certain notice rice if you're a victim about hearings in court cases\nBut in this case if you're the victim of a crime and that individuals getting out of jail or parole or other types of ages ... to make sure there was in the constitution\nThat you will get some kind of notification a and can be repaired and you even have some rights to go back and ask that not happen in certain cases or seek other types of protection so emotionally at times on your heartstrings\nThere are and it was started by an individual who was familiar with the case in another state where someone was notify\nThe California built billionaire\nYou're it's I'm a Tamar ... you probably will be ... been hearing about it in Washington because there are many states that are passing versions of Mars these law it it all relates back to ... Nicholas a young woman in California who was murdered\nAnd within a week after the a murder took place the family ... family walked into a store and saw\nThe guy who's been arrested for her killing walking free and they were stunned to have to find this out so tomorrow this is this is something this is a ... a big national campaign as Jim says funded by money from a one billionaire out there\nAnd think starting to catch it congressional race I think a lot of Republican actually wait actually\nBut uh but I Will tell you a bill that the ACLU heads as pushback very very hard on this bill a because what it's ... it's it's it's main point being that depicts victims rights a ... they're they're asking for the creation of a relationship between victims and the state\nThat would directly contradict a lot of the the the the relationship between a a a an accused of murder trader and the state\nAnd uh if uh if the\nIf you if you talk to a lot of lawyers they're saying this is not a place you know there's this is ... and what's more it's as as you said it's a ... we have all most a lot of this stuff is already in statute and we're putting an end to the constitution that's a that's a bad\nYou know one of the things Michael that that the critics have said is basically what what Galloway just pointed out it's that you suddenly allow the victims or the victim's family to be involved\nIt's basically what what Galloway just pointed out it's that you suddenly allow the victims or the victim's family to be involved in a court proceeding you wouldn't you have to be able to see\nThe mother of a of an assault victim and murder victim on the jury not obviously that's forbidden by law the critics suggest that there are some similarity when you allow the family to enter into court proceedings and therefore become part of\nThe essentially the criminal justice system\nThat is that is part of a concern I mean it literally spells it out and it says you know that a writes for the victims would inclusion of any schedule court appearances and the opportunity to be heard any scheduled proceedings involving the release plead or sentencing it'd be a key so it puts them right there right in the middle of it\nTomorrow or you've got to figure that the language of this amendment he's already basically said it is such\nThat there is no chance in the world is just going to pass giving victims of ... giving the families of victims of crime rights to be involved this is why the way in which the constitutional amendment is written has a lot to do with how people perceive it right tomorrow or [laughter]\nAnd that's why we have like ... [laughter] alright ...\nReal quick uh the last one is a an amendment number five and a the amendments kind of a gym it's pretty straightforward\nUh basically what number five says is that if you have a school district\nThat has a city school system within the county so in a DeKalb County you have the uh uh Decatur school systems in Marietta and it basically ... it used to be that you'd have to have separate agreement but each system if\nYou're if if a if a if a lake county is seeking a school's ... staff than it has to get the permission of both the county wide school system and the ... and the and the city school system which often leaves the the kind of the uh it it gives a great deal of leverage to that smaller system\nAnd uh and I think uh if uh if I'm not mistaken I think one of the main backers of the ... amendment was Lindsey tip ends up in Miami out out in Maryland up yet and and and he did not you know he he didn't appreciate the larger Cobb County school system being held hostage by the Marriott assist\nI Want to be careful about how we share this with ...\nAnd he did not you know he didn't appreciate the larger Cobb County school system being held hostage by the Marriott assist\nI Want to be careful about how we share this with our listeners have because I Believe this removes the requirement that a county systematic city school district have to agree before calling for a referendum it removes that are necessary grand ...\nThat's right right right which gave the smaller system a lot of leverage right over the larger system or just a new kind of Ghana in Marietta but also in a smaller communities all around there about twenty twenty systems lab independent city like Lawrence in in Dublin in a violent and I guess maybe Gainesville and you've got\nYour few others around the state that do that and so I gave them a president of leverage in a few of them abuse at times that leverage and even though they represent thirty percent of the revenue\nOf the county they might have wanted forty or fifty percent after the attacks was collected and so the larger counties you know kind of rivalry there I think this will be a good when you know to support because it does now there were certain examples where they weren't getting the votes done because people were holding things up\nLike I just wanted to kind of take a step back just kind of based on some of the questions that I get about the about the whole is that the fact that you know their state wide number one right and that ah they've already gone through the house and Senate had two thirds of approval so lots of questions about that from people All right uh\nWhat we're going to do it we're going to take a break right now there are ... there are certain there's some statewide referenda on other ballots as well but that's enough for looking at these ballot issues today before election day we'll look at those couple of referenda there pretty gym there for tea in the weeds\nIn the enough to\nLet's do this or let's take a break and when we come back let's talk about a ... a news that's coming out of our twenty eight feet election cycle\nPeter Spiegel here and it's hard I Want you to try something roll up the windows you're all sealed inside take a good smell\nCan you smell that that was the great cologne experiments of two thousand for it you should not have gone with the dollar store for that one boy you can lose that older car smell my donating your vehicle one of your favorite causes like public radio it only takes a few minutes and just like that he supported the station and well you are on your way to a life of better smell [noise]\nGo to ... dot org slash cars and thanks\nBack to political rewind a quick clarification attempt ... told me during the break or that I got it wrong I'm always the last to learn the\nWelcome back to political rewind a quick clarification ... told me during the break uh that I got it wrong I'm always the last to learn these things ... election night from seven to eight we will be on television and streaming on Facebook we won't go on the radio statewide\nIn till after eight o'clock so\nJoined it said seven by BP be TV or on Facebook Live you know what I'm instead of ... you have not had to get involved in too much of the business of this show yet\nWe were going to let's talk about the congressional races before we talked about some updates let's make it hard on yeah\nLet's make some little for a big money she gets on the show tomorrow you had you file to pieces on the sixth and seventh restrict braces\nAnd I wanted to talk about him with you and the panel first of all you just filed um to my knowledge within the last few hours of peace on the sixth district congressional race Lucy McBath\nWhy but you know I Wonder if she wants to just really pump up the Democratic load\nLimit there's two ... two messages they're number one go vote yeah a number to\nBe very careful and make sure that vote is counted I mean this is this is you know look if if if Brian Kemp Brian Kemp closing messages is is is going to be be where the ... illegal immigrants who come to vote she's going to be there are messages going to be make sure they don't they they don't toss aside your ballot\nYou yeah you know I think it's it's been stuff that we've continued to say I'm In all these efforts around whether your vote is going to count or\nUm you know are you going to be a rejected or something that the thing is get out there early go vote boot provisional if you can if there's a problem we have from opportunity to to to fix it but there's also the thing that you know things come up and if you wait till election day\nUm you know you you could actually have enough to your vote count but I Will tell you I get lots of calls in and you know nice old ladies will call and you know say well man this is where your polling location is and um you know you can actually go vote you know on Monday\nAll of them and you know nice old ladies will call and you know say well man this is where your polling location is and um you know you can actually go vote you know on Monday and she goes oh no I'm voting on election down ... so we're still going to see you know these these are devoted Kamara election day and so I don't I don't know that we can still\nEven at the end of early voting you know we can look at this but no we still have a good turn our election\nDay you know I was just looking at the early voting returns that as of the end of business on friday and you've still got and I wondered if this was another reason that Stacey Abrams ... went to south ... mall to vote early\nYou've now got your covering it almost a thirty percent a little under thirty percent black turnout early twenty nine point seven or so they are and he'd love to get the number of ...\nThat that number up a ... by the end of the day on November ... she needed that nobody that number needs to be thirty one thirty two\nAll right meanwhile uh Brian Kemp ... who's about to get go off on this big bus tour around the state he's been back in rural Georgia but he's going to launch an official or\nA fairly soon I'm not quite sure exactly when he's but it's ... yeah I think it kicks off on Sunday and Monday we are joined in ... in the meantime he Jim had a couple of really positive developments for him number one over the weekend the president went back on Twitter and renewed his call for the people of Georgia\nTo vote for Brian Kemp is the best candidate for governor\nAnd uh that certainly helped Brian and they are in the runoff but then here's the I think and you'll tell me about this gym the even bigger wide and it was this commercial\nThis election is about Georgia's future\nWe can't afford billions in big government with higher taxes Ryan camp is\nThe only candidate who will keep Georgia moving fall\nRon as a businessman who will grow our economy and create jobs my investing in education\nAnd Brian will keep your just say strong I'm Nathan Deal Ron count will keep Georgia moving in the right direction\nGym it's nice to have the president but in Georgia haven't Nathan Deal special\nThat that's important and you'll notice that the that ... the commercial was a very non specific it was it was very very very good let the governor say what he wanted to exactly what he wanted to say there this is if you are a Democrat in Georgia\nIt was it was very very ... to let the governor say what he wanted to exactly what he wanted to say there\nThis is if you are a Democrat in Georgia this is where the voice starts to tighten the less for it and we're in the last two weeks\nAnd here we are and and now the full weight of Republican influenced begins to kind of come down on your campaign or a gift we saw Trump entered the race over the weekend I mean but eight years ago it was it was George W or\nMaybe a little bit more than a laws I Won ten years and years ago it was it was and it was George W uh uh this is this is we talk about this period when when the when the when the Republican base comes home and we were at the front door that\nPeriod ... to ... let me let me just to pick up on some Big Jim said though I mean I I get that you know Trump's popularity according to be a juicy polling and and it may have changed since the last poll which is we can live more than a week plus ago\nA hovering right around fifty percent I Would argue that ah that in many ways Nathan Deal who is enormously popular a is a bigger endorsement right now than Donald Trump\nYeah and and they don't gala in all of our oil and they'll ask here at ... ... ... ... ... ... like in in charge at worst at it and try and more so than\nAny current or any any other\nKind of a special talent that definitely will at the same time Republican it out\nThere not wanting to kind of ... and I think that that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation really galvanized and I I think there still is quite a bit of trouble ... over the next two weeks to campaign account\nMichael a Stacey Abrams has made a point over and over again of saying that an issue because obviously she gets how popular Nathan Deal is with Republicans and Democrats\nUm of saying how she worked with Nathan Deal and the legislature especially on criminal justice report a reform does this take any of the wind out of her sales in trying to argue that she really is the inherent or of the deal legacy in some ways\nI don't think so I mean there is no surprise at the end of the day you know Republican governors going to come out and endorse the Republican nominee so there there is no surprise there but Abrams has been consistent what she says how she's been able to work across the aisle\nRepublican governors going to come out and endorse the Republican nominee so there there is no surprise there but ... has been consistent what she says how she's been able to work across the aisle and our campaign is is basically out there for all Georgia's you know so um I don't see a surprise and they\nTell you what you have if you tell me the one thing that I that looking at that at and listening to a just a few minutes ago the softness of that ad ah makes me feel that it's directed\nAt women voters shows no question right the first of all bill you're right it was a powerful one two punch\nNobody can motivate based Republican voters in the state of Georgia better than Donald Trump when it comes to tweets and getting stuff out for the base\nAnd we know that the Democrats are organized and coming to vote and historic numbers already so that was important but Nathan Deal I Do think is probably the land span of the campaign because of that ad goes right to is independent women and independent men a gym you know we forget there are a lot of independent voter men\nAnd Nathan Deal is speaking right to both independent meant an independent women there are Nathan Deal Democrat still out there in the state of Georgia and\nUh they like him you know the state is clear in all polling that most the majority of Georgia's St George's going in the right direction and I think that's why the ad with that line Brian Campbell keep us going in the right direction is a nice\nVery not so subtle hand off from a ... one person to the next and it helps smooth over any of the rough edges to some people think Brian Kemp still has\nI don't and I don't think we should uh a failed to mention jam that a deal was he was reluctant to jump into he certainly didn't want to jump in on behalf of Casey Cagle he was on the stage with Brian camp in a big Republican rally the night or two after a camp won the runoff\nBut he's been relatively quiet so far in this campaign\nI mean the the higher politics he got caught up in the higher politics so he came out and endorsed Cagle I think a\nWith a with a with a a visit is does it make me kind of a fan and a and then he was he was immediately big footed by the Purdue cousins who who who were able to bring Trump\nYeah All right let's do this let's get another break out of the way because when we come back Brian Kemp\nA in an op ed piece he wrote in the Sunday Atlanta Journal constitution made a claim that uh I think deserves our attention and scrutiny you're listening to political rewind and the next ...\nClaim that um I think deserves our attention and scrutiny you're listening to political rewind\nAnd the next fresh air Melissa McCarthy\nAnd never have to\nLook at the stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a biographer times literary forward here we'll talk about the film growing up on a farm or early comedy act heroin bridesmaids and playing Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live join us\nFresh air is this afternoon at three or ... hand GB new subtle\nWelcome back to political rewind or as we get into a they are kept campaign what's very quickly or listen to a I'm a big name who is being here today campaigning on behalf of Brian Kemp a\nMarco Rubio a was in ... county I think this morning and then went over to fall into a city of Atlanta right Jim Wright right to appearances and caught but let's listen to what Rubio had to say\nAnd you heard about all the money pouring in you know while that money pours in from all over the country because they want to nationalize these rights\nMake these races about what's happening everywhere else except here but it's about here because when the election's over everybody gets up in those onto another campaign somewhere else which is still lives here and you're so miserable still lives here and your children and grandchildren's future will be here\nThat's what you're trying to build through the campaign\nAnd it won't matter if you don't vote\nMarco Rubio okay tomorrow I don't mean to be a skeptic but this is a Republican talking about Democrats dragged to nationalize the campaign when Donald Trump is going from rallied a rally saying vote for so and so is a vote for me you", "year": "2018",
