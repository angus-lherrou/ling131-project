we have a panel here that's still very energized to talk about all that's been going on and we start with\nThe Asia lead political writer Jim Galloway you read them in a Wednesday in Sunday paper and of course he oversees the political insider blog an agency aren't you it's like it's hard to keep up\nJim ... the county to county down counting down today yeah that's right that's what that's what gets me Patricia Murphy is\nWith us too she has been involved in politics on the hill a for a long time she worked for um\nSam Nunn max Cleveland ... sticking out to him and she is a columnist for both the Daily Beast and roll call thanks for joining us today don't marry America Oliver democratic state representative is here with us today at one point we're going to talk to you because you were in the courtroom during this a\nVoter suppression case that went down I'm looking forward to getting your observations have made it a wonderful job okay ah says the Democrat who was very happy with the result of Republican strategist Brian Robin ... is with us he of course served as Nathan Deal is\nCommunications director during the governor's first term and now is doing consulting work with the Republicans including your big one\nIs amendment number four ... slot right\nThat's right if you care about crime victims rights yeah\nEarned a little of the money you know [laughter] All right you know Jim what started we can't I'm One of the things we've said on the show for a while now is that candidates in Georgia for governor for Congress other races\nHave tended they've been focusing on they've been staying home in terms of the issues they want to focus on\nThat's all changed really in the last week at least suddenly national issues are playing a bigger role that's a fair way of saying it\nFocus on that's all changed\nReally in the last week at least subtly national issues are playing a bigger role that's a fair way of saying the maybe the biggest one being a the discovery of the pipe bombs that went out to a prominent critics of President Trump\nA unrest in the case um and suddenly a you've got a both Brian cap and Stacey Abrams talking about that as they go out on the stump\nYou know you you are in ... you're you're going to find that Stacey Abrams is here to more year to talk about it than Brian Kemp just given given the the the profile the we have the fellow who who's been arrested in the ... cases\nA and and and it's ... the other hot button issue was for for Republicans which is is it to keep wanting people to this\nThose parade of refugees that are a thousand miles ... miles away in in in Mexico\nWell let's let's deal with that for a second I'm shortly before the arrest was made in this case of President Trump's set out a tweet which speaks to exactly what Jim is talking about let me show it\nAnd read it and then ask everybody to a response here's what a president said Republicans are doing so well early voting and oppose it now this bomb stuff\nHappens and momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what is going on Republicans go out and vote Brian it feels like\nAnd this isn't a particularly unique observation everything the president sees is filtered through this political mid term lines [noise]\nI don't really understand that tweet that it's I don't really know I came back in time to deeply on it because I don't\nKnow any needs about you know the political coverage is slowing momentum and smelling [noise] I I don't necessarily agree with that Republican momentum is pretty strong right now I don't think that this has this is only a national conversation going on around us\nAnd I was just hard to see both sides coming out with wild theories about what it was and we had no facts about who it was the other day Republicans saying it was a false flag attacked the I'm near Democrats using\nAppraise such as Stacey Abrams who said it was an assassination attempt that we don't know that we didn't know that are going to find out a lot more now that there's been harassed by the right person but I disagree with the underlying premise that this has hurt Republicans on some level that wasn't my premise is really this is what surprised me\nIn fact the right person but I disagree with the underlying premise that this was hurt Republicans in some way that wasn't my premise was the leader here that's what he's saying I Am confused by the way frankly Patricia\nI'm into a state races\nThe other one of course is the care or the president has really really whipped up a frenzy about bees who knows six thousand five thousand seven thousand I hear numbers all over the map\nPeople who are marching through Central America maybe to the southern border maybe now we really don't know the keys to an eight hundred troops us troops to the border to beef things up to be things up in anticipate in anticipation of a\nA foot bones caravan that might get to Texas by February right so let's with that in mind I'm let's hear how in the it suddenly in Jersey congressional races a Republican candidates have picked up\nOn this theme here was a debate or in the sixth district race or in which Karen Handel was facing off a Democrat Lucy and we passed and this is where Karen Handel said\nWhat I Do support is legal found immigration I Would hope that all of us can agree that a caravan with thousands of people\nWorking its way to our border in an effort to storm into our country is something that we cannot have it underscores exactly why we must have border security I support the law I support when ever measures we must take to secure the border\nAs long as we're there let's listen to what Lucy McBath so I said about the same subject\nI Do believe that we should have strong security and law enforcement at the borders\nWe should have vetting but I Do believe that we should be looking at each in every case individually we should not be assuming that people that are coming here from war torn nations or coming here for political asylum are the keys and criminals\nSo I'm Patricia or the president has successfully introduced this\nPolitical asylum are the keys and criminals\nSo I'm Patricia or the president has successfully introduce this issue into every congressional race virtually across the country and and killed a pipe bombs he was dominating headlines by talking about another kind of Bob the caravan headed\nNorth well immigration specifically illegal immigration has always been the bread and butter for this president I was interested in this debate on that Karen Handel who I think most of these races they are trying to keep this highly localized she went hard nationally I think the word storm in particular\nThat to me she's made the calculation she needs to get her Republican base voters\nOut even if she could offend some more moderate\nUm more moderate Republicans or with the way she characterized people coming to this country at least in the grass on the other hand I thought had a particular for a Democrat and the cycle one of the more measured response says there's no talk about abolishing ice there's no talk about um you know I'm going to the whole idea about immigration at all that I Know of\nUm but that was more measured and a number of other Democrats I think she's playing a lot more toward the middle\nAnd hair Karen Handel I heard they're playing it more to the right\nThe doors storm is a code word a bad word the feel of these unfortunate people carrying their children on their shoulders he might arrive at a dribble in February of courses of sexually dishonest picture to try to put forward to the voters in the sixth or seventh congressional district\nEvery Democrat I Know starts with we must have border security we must have border security spending thirty billion dollars on a wall is not border security it's how you do it and what our philosophies are and whether or not you're trying to scare people or whether you're trying to do it honestly is the issue\nOf you you you know you know what what what I find really interesting about this is is\nIt it's it's it's the ... Republican\nKind of accepting Trump's measure of the situation\nBecause I as as Patricia so I mean I mean immigration has always been Trump's closer ... I mean it was it was this time in in in in in in sixteen does what he was totally open or to live for our you know where do you think that and and and the traditional Republican instinct\nWould be to go back to those tax cuts that were passed in December and point to the ... economy\nAnd and the these great job numbers and and the growth and\nWould it be to go back to those tax cuts that were passed in December and point to the ... economy and and the these great job numbers and and the growth and that's not but that's that's what's happening and I wonder\nAs a consultant as a Republican consultant\nIt it's got to be a little when you don't have a congressional candidate in in this cycle of my ... I think you don't you don't really have any political candidate okay that's right okay so\nIt it is is is is that tactic you would settle on is it frustrating that the tax cuts hasn't resonated that the unemployment rate hasn't really resonated is is the is the caravan something you would advise a Republican to really focus on at this point\nWhere we ask them was Karen Handel and a ... which is to say local\nI thought caring response was fantastic I I agree I agree with everywhere that she said in that debate that Rob ... mother had was really good to\nVisit I Would definitely encourage it because it goes really even beyond a\nHard core Republicans a lot of independents agree we've got a broken system uh my friend Mary Margaret sad oh these you know these people their children and they\nThey're just trying to seek safety that real perspective of the Democrats which end end up as a solution well they need us just let them all in Mali wind it will not look at how if not agreeable it twelve million illegal immigrants in this country that's not a dribble\nSomething that has that has directly impacting our nation\nWhen ever end that country gets to fourteen or Fifteen Percent of the population being foreign born throughout our entire history\nThere's a reaction and we are historically high levels are looking\nOut for a limited number one the twelve million had been there that's nothing new but it's not that's not new but it's I mean we've been arguing about that since since Nineteen Ninety All right I guess my question is why does does tend to student print on a border Crump\nA really sound economic message\nI think they kind of message is part of it I\nDon't think that you go out and talk about it because people know it I mean people have to have people know that things are good in their neighborhoods like in twenty can they knew they were bad and they have their neighborhoods so glance talking about it and claiming credit for his important and they are\nBut that doesn't include all other issues immigration is an issue that Americans care deeply about and the Democrats have become so extreme\nBut that doesn't exclude all other issues and immigration is an issue that Americans care deeply about and the Democrats have become so extreme on the issue of our big old remind me of I don't want you to come on there's lane or the remark\nPower to the extreme I mean it was like a treasure brought up the talking about abolishing I says something that's become part of a mainstream part of democratic\n... means me by the Democratic talking points that's what a number of the Democrats are getting the most to press on the issue are calling to abolish ice which is something I'd never heard before until this cycle there I just don't know if it's mainstream among\nHere right here in Georgia Stacey Abrams calling for a new immigrants to get hope scholarships if they are for another day that's what I mean the money or a very murdered you get the last word before I take a break thank you\nDavid how I was in the Senate district part of it than the current house district there are thousands small businesses legally operating where you go to restaurants where I go to restaurants the economic viability of different highway is a dramatic example of positive immigration\nResult we need to do better with integration we need to protect our borders and we need to fix what is\nTruly brother and I do want to take one more moment on this because obviously there's disagreement but Patricia whether Mary Margaret Brian agree on whether the president ought to be a you know whipping up fear about a caravan\nHis approval ratings have gone up and it appears that the gap in energy between Republican voters and democratic voters has tightened so it appears that to some extent it may be working\n[noise] well I don't know exactly which part of it is working certainly in Georgia and I'm at three simple the president's approval rating is at forty nine percent which is quite high I mean you're getting into normal territory\nBecause the economy is unbelievable right now I have to sort of re read the economic numbers that they come out because there are just almost so eye popping leap odd to me it\nWas good ... a month ago two months ago when the president's approval rating wasn't as high end when it appeared that Democrats were much more energized to turn out to vote so there does seem to be something happening here with the presidents or a red\nShirt I think so I think there's probably still a lab a positive effect after Republicans from the ... Kavanaugh hearings I think that their own woke up a lot of Republicans to say and I remember when I was upset in the first place [laughter] you know so and that and that's why they\nAnd for Republicans from the ... hearings I think that there was a lot of Republicans to say and I remember when I was in the first place [laughter] you know cell and that and that's why they like this president I exactly what happened with Brett Kavanaugh is who they wanted and it's how they want it it it got done turn on and it was a very high profile duct tape and that's that\nI I turning point because Republicans who maybe don't like Donald Trump who Democrats how they shot at Democrats from minded those people a lot they didn't like the rest\nOf the ... All right let's do this or we want to get a break and when we come back I wanted to talk a little more about the governor's race Jim we've seen on NBC News poll that has some really interesting uh numbers in it and we should talk a bit about that uh will do that after this break [noise]\n\nI Am Ira Flatow this week on science friday we traveled to the moon and back with Neil Armstrong the new film first man man every intention of coming back\nTo what met said toward the end of the debate the other night\nI Am here before you fast for your vote this is going to be a runoff anyway if you're tired of the two party system and the two parties journey of the oligarchs running the planet than a vote for me as a protest vote to show them that you're sick and tired of the same old stuff\nUh basically being a libertarian is leave me alone don't tell me what to do and do still my stuff\nBrian ... the NBC poll has him at four percent and ... oh my God that's enough for a run off yeah I Do want to say that I treated outback quote that he used there because I thought it really spoke to me they\nLeave me alone and stuff like that if they're in Johnson\nWere here he would say that's the Senate of all of you Brookhaven three car\nGarage but what about this\nNotion that we could be headed for a run off I think is a distinct possibility and I want to correct what I said earlier I misspoke when I say about the moms and now\nThey seem to\nMe about the poll I\nI was wrong I think the polls\nThey seemed to me about the poll I\nI was wrong I think the poll is wrong I think it's a bad number I think if if they have the black vote at twenty five percent that that that Brian Kemp sleep we will be much bigger in that sample to the end it was so I think it's about ... percent I mean they never really get more than two so let's say\nEven ... even ... where do you ... nobody's over fifty percent veterans\nHonestly believe that Brian Kemp is two to three points a hat and I think he's going to win between four and five points\nPatricia I'm we haven't seen a candidate break fifty percent in ... in any polling on this\nAnd we have that we've um and we haven't I don't think seen her in the lead at all and end as well I have very early very early\nOn but I think at Georgia's tend to go about two percent I don't know that Mr Mann says performances ... plus percent on but this race is so close it feels so cause I wouldn't be surprised the fire went off I don't think that on anybody who is voting for Mr Mets would seriously have been a real vote for anybody else\nI think that somebody just going out to vote on the state of affairs in the world\nHe did but I thought that was there but I thought you said that he he told me it was a protest vote if I Want to be smart\nHe's running as a disruptor yeah\nAnd and you know ... that that's kind of what Trump also maybe he's trying to peel off just a sliver of that\nI Would have been on the on the run off I Would think you know on on the election I ... I Will be I've I've got a vacation at steaks well I'm In a runoff governor I think it's far more likely that you're going to see a run off in those two in one of those two don't say a down ballot via the\nRaces yeah okay I think we're looking at her on a vacation or in the study of yours or you think we're looking at a runoff in the governor's race yes and possibly others to particularly the governor's race okay is it Mary murdered as long as we're talking about a potential run off I thought a political insider this may have been actually you're writing\nGym or if there is a runoff election will be on December forthright Nathan Deal has called a special session beginning on the level of certainty in their ... their teeth Brian Kemp if he is still secretary of state\nWould have to recuse himself from any fundraising during the time of the special session is that finally the moment Brian Kemp decides it's time to give up his job\nWould have to recuse himself from any fundraising during the time of the special session is that finally the moment Brian Kemp decides it's time to give up his job\nHas me 'cause he's gotten enough salary for two thousand eight to ... maybe it's just one for salary for the wouldn't surprise me at all that would be a significant a pen sunrise thing for that four or five days then we'll and special session\nLast week where we are going to seek kept stepped out if there was a run up you know he great boosting asked him during the debate you didn't want to repeat cues yourself or or give up your job during the election or if there's a ... said would you recuse yourself from that and the camp basically said no but\nWhat happens if there's a special uh if if there is a run off to see give it up to it and keep raising money\nWell he's been very loath to average sign up to this point I'm from talking letters I think it led up probably in front of the confidence in the election results if he were to recuse himself will have to see an\nSessions going to be more attention to the capital it's going to be more attention to if we're in a runoff which is what I fear\nBut as you but if if there if there is a runoff there will be tremendous pressure cry on governor deal and on a disk mob of legislators in the state capital to get from their business just be the fast as I can get a bill through I think it's five ...\nUh and and I wouldn't expect it to be a tick beyond that\nLet's do this so let's say a final breaking the show when we come back we had an important ruling in a federal lawsuit over alleged voter suppression a we have with somebody who's in the courtroom to watch how those arguments unfolded and we have a panel of experts who can comment on what they think happened you're a this is political re wide\n[noise] financial contributions from listeners like you are not the only gift that keeps gp beyond the air in fact many listeners have already chosen to donate a used vehicle to GDP will pick up your vehicle for free and send you the paperwork for your taxes\nGet started today called eight seven seven GP being one car or go to G.

Georgia project it hadn't been buying cans primary day job too I'm In his mind clean up the voter rolls but then also pass the legislation that has been quite controversial\nAnd ... match in particular as the secretary state needs to have been battling it out over this issue\nFor nearly a decade and so here we are\nFinally to the campaign um the reason I decided to do some reporting on this issue specifically to see how letters or feeling it out at how is this filtering down to their own behavior and their own opinion about what's going to be happening in the race when because there have been so many national headlines\nFeel specifically to see how voters are feeling it out at how is this filtering down to their own behavior of their own opinion about what's going to be happening in the race when because there have been so many national headlines\nI tend to think that national headlines are often times I Will get into sort of a sort of making a lot of assumptions about a southern state and I wanted to just see how it's affecting people and so I went down the middle Georgia and talked to a number of voters and it's just I have to say my my primary mission is just very sad to talk to voters\nAbout how concerned they were about the integrity of their vote and especially older African Americans um Georgians a born and raised here who feel that they have been struggling their entire life I think\nYou are to quote was an older African American woman who so why bother voting my\nVote one county said that's the she was getting as she is calling voters to get out and vote and they say why should I just really going to count\nWere tweet are we in fact we have I think Tom House tells me a rubber gyms was going to tweet out a link to that column so Jim this sets the stage for a lawsuit went into federal court this past week and uh basically two organizations ACLU being one of them said uh they were challenging specifically\nThe effect that county election offices were rejecting absentee ballots that were coming in based on believing that the signatures between the registration card in the ... a vote or didn't match got that right\nJust as a slight correction they well they were objecting to a whole lot of the stuff and the judge said the the the cleanest thing I clean as quick as I can do right now is rule on this on your", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "26"}
