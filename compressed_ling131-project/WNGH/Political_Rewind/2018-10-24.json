middle of your question and uh they thank goodness\nIt only took about four minutes to correct it but it was embarrassing beginning debate we all have fiery open thank God that wasn't actually real fire was not a not a real threat it was just the faulty wiring apparently yeah\nWe're going to talk about the debate and get everybody in the studios reaction to it as a ... he's political reporter for the AJC\nHe was on a panel last night and got to ask I think I got about four questions in ... and one yes no because we had about twenty seconds left that actually in a minute we're going to at some point we're going to talk about what that yes no it was because it's important uh So Greg is with us I'm Audrey Haynes\nIs back with us today she of course is an associate professor of political science of University of Georgia\nShe's also oversees the issue here is the director of the applied politics certificate program which we have said to our listeners a couple of times in explaining it\nYou don't really preparing your political science students for work in the ... in the field of politics\nYeah semi work with a grade school of journalism to help students who are interested in a political communications to prepare for that arena have a working fat Greg has come and participated in the program as well so we interact with a lot of practitioners Andy I'm In a state and at the national level\nWill read all of poor is he or she is a Republican strategist she's a former press secretary to a former governor Sonny Perdue and she also was the co chair of Carly Fiorina's presidential campaign you know given that you do for all you've done political consulting Loretta\nI when you hear a re say she's preparing students to go into the field of politics do\nYou think that's a good thing or a bad thing [laughter]\nThink it is a good thing you know I don't mind them going into it but I think they really have to understand that dynamic yeah what I mean\nWell I I think that sometimes um some of the students that are coming into the field don't understand how aggressive it has become as a profession I mean my ... my son is that is that masks\nSome of the students that are coming into the field don't understand how aggressive as ... as a profession I mean my ... my son is that\nWas focused on issues last night throughout much of it you you said that one way or another that she gave a lot of detail in terms of positions she's a taken in the race and of course one of the things that we know about Stacey Abrams is that she has made expanding Medicaid the top\nIssue in her campaign let's listen to how she says it last night\nI'm so bullish on Medicaid expansion because I Know it works it's a bipartisan proven solution and even governor Mike Pence dead and the state of Indiana\nGeorgia has more rural hospitals on the brink of closure than almost any other state and unless we expand Medicaid draw down to three billion dollars to which we are entitled and invested in Georgia we will not be able to build the strongest rural Georgia it'd be neat\nWhat you're hearing here is probably going to be her closing message nationally you're hearing Democrats look for years ago six years ago this was Republican attack\nIt was Obamacare is is needs to be repealed it ... it was Obamacare is the root of a lot of a of a new government bureaucracy now you're in Democrats over the nation sees on Medicaid expansion because poll after poll after poll shows the majority of voters\nAre in different states or a approve of some form of expansion and this is the lying Stacey Abrams of said throughout which is pointing to Mike Pence on the other Republican governors in red states who also embrace Medicaid expansion\nUnder does it strike you as you why she was raised in a folder and when you think about that soundbite and others like it last night the Abrams\nHas done to maybe get the voters have potentially a better understanding of the things that she wants to do at this point than camp her message seems more focused in his doesn't mean people are gonna wipe the message\nWell I mean I think naturally Abrams is more of a policy wonk and camp and so I think she has some natural advantages here in terms of being able to talk about issues in details because this is a natural home for her\nAnd at the end of the day I think there is a lot of negative pious and shit that's influencing what's going on here and so by negative partisanship I mean that people identify with the opposite of what they believe us and so people who are inclined to vote for Brian Kemp a voting\nWhat's going on here and so by negative partisanship I mean that people identify with the opposite of what they believe us and so people who are inclined to vote for Brian Kemp a voting for him in\nPart because he's not a Democrat or he's not Stacey Abrams and so it it in that respect it actually really doesn't matter whether or not he's more or less detailed than she is\nWell I Would say that also on you know on the Republican side to your point if you if you've got this bifurcated electorate that for for Republicans what they hear when Stacey Abrams talks about Medicaid expansion I hear this over and over again is she's going to be a big government governor she's going to expand government every opportunity that she has and so\nSo there's there's that on the surface and the second level the one thing that really bothered me that she said about Medicaid expansion last night was that it was the only solution\nAnd when you're governing um you have to really be creative\nAnd to think that Medicaid expansion is going to solve all of our healthcare else it's just it's a it's an ... it's a promise you can't keep\nBecause in our rural communities the closest thing\nTo to health care or community pharmacists and some of our counties we have\nNo doctors community pharmacist is acting as the lead healthcare professional in certain parts of our role to me ... and some of our rural communities so to say that it's going to solve all the problems of healthcare in rural Georgia is not true because we don't have doctors for these patients to me is\nI just you know drill down a little bit of a new ... she certainly has showcased Medicaid expansion is the key issue in her race I've not heard say that it is the only thing we knew to do to fix our entire healthcare system however\nWell I haven't heard that either I think she's focused on that primarily because she's interested in a sort of a rural a reinvigorate Haitian and that is a you know one part of one of the things she's talking about how do you bring people into rural areas they're not going to go there if there is no doctors\nAnd doctors aren't going to practice somewhere when people don't have enough money to pay them that Medicaid expansion sometimes will help with that I mean I think I Would add sort of the folks on rural hospitals\nAs being something that was related but a little bit separate from Medicaid expansion well it is different but it is it is tied in because there's the reimbursement growing component of that\nArgument is that now that it's chicken egg but she says the horse and the ... the kind of been together hand in hand I mean his argument is that less regulations are more flexible\nIt's chicken egg but she says the horse and the ... they they kind of gum to gather hand in hand I mean his argument is that less regulations or an and more flexibility to spend federal dollars on what you might choose to spend it on ... will lead to more development and right\nAnd so when you look at Mike Pence's plan like Mike Pence expanded Medicaid and Indiana there is a component in there that Medicaid recipients certain Medicaid recipients at certain threshold have to contribute some of their own dollars it's not it's not totally um\nSteps you know paid for by the state or the federal government that there's an expectation you know some sliding scale\nThat Medicaid recipients at certain levels\nPay in and if they don't they will lose their coverage and so she doesn't go on to talk about those types of things where as you are right is that Brian Kemp is looking at a way to say yes we do need to drive down those federal funds they belong to Georgians and we can look at waivers as a way to do that is a lot of states have done including Wisconsin recently in Arkansas\nUm and and how do we make that system set for George\n... was a critical in the debate of camp she says he didn't have a health care plan at all\nThat's not quite correct he's introduced the notion that he would ask for federal waivers the great you cover these two pretty closely when camp talks about waivers\nThe waivers he won would provide subsidies for people who are buying insurance on the exchange already which doesn't take into consideration all of those are underserved Georgians who Abrams wants to ensure through Medicaid expansion is that\nCorrect yeah and I are private insurance sort of they cost ability waivers and not for Medicaid is in his words for Affordable Care act so these are not Medicaid waivers he's asking for but it has been you're right it has been a weakness for ... for a long time because for the longest time his his healthcare plan was\nMostly revolving around his opposition to medicate expansion wasn't until about two or three weeks ago it down in Cook County they'll Georgia\nOr where he he did a unveil a more detailed healthcare platform but until then Abrams hammering camp for only having a seven word or so health care plan\nSteven oh you're in the studio or you were in control of me or one place or the other watching this debate unfold lesson I one of the things that struck me\nIf one of the ways in which we define how this debate unfolded was Abrams trying to stick to the message is put out throughout the campaign I think it's fair to say that another a way that we can look at this debate is\nHow camp hammering away at a bus\nOf the campaign I think it's fair to say that another a way that we can look at this debate is how can hammer away at Abrams and tried to de legitimize her as a candidate for governor I Want to play just a little bit of his closing argument\nUm or his closing statement and ask you to comment about it here's here's the opportunity to be an for Abramson camp to say what they stood for\nThis election as a fight for our future my opponent has run the disc most dishonest campaign Georgians have ever seen and here's why she's lying about my record to hide her extreme agenda she won't higher taxes bigger government a single payer radical government takeover of health care and those are her moderate\nPositions she also wants to get taxpayer benefits\nA welfare and free college tuition to those here illegally and she's an even asking illegals to vote for her in this race not even California is that liberal\nSo see when I have to say\nThat I understand in the in the in the mid term election cycle the ... where you've got a president who's out there pounding away at Democrats left and right that Kim is why sue again disqualify her as a as a legitimate candidate for governor but that seemed like a very\nHarsh wave to want to close out your argument in a debate also it it's\nPar for the course of what the ... campaign and some of the state Republican Party messaging that's gone out against Abrams of they've seized on this quote that Abrams said a campaign about what Senator Elizabeth Warren that I was at\nWhere she said the blue wave this coming in Georgia and she lifts up different people and different things that are on it and she says it includes undocumented and documented people and uh in the context of that speech Abrams says that it was who was going to be supportive and who's in Georgia who she is they're representing\nBut it's one of the many things that have been used to attack Abrams as too radical too liberal for Georgia there been male or set out of calling her you know comrade Stacey that she some socialist communist liberal so this closing statement really\nSums up the method of attacking Abrams in our policies that she doesn't represent or does he doesn't belong in Georgia and\nThat's the that's kind of what kept saying there\nWas you all think of that well and I would say I ... I put that into the literature where they talk about on the matter is behind that kind of messaging that kind of messaging fear messages hear ads\nYou put that into the literature where they talk about um the motive behind that kind of messaging that kind of messaging fear messages fear ads um they tend to um heightened attended this people pay more attention to that they hear it and it\nWeakens people's reliance on partisan cues so that is a way for him to kind of chip away to generate maybe some flaking from people who are we partisans on the on the law left or independent\nSo part of it's a common national trip you tie that candidates to extremist and the hopes that it will be mobilized to folks and then sort of undercut their support 'em but then they're also becomes the issue of if we are going to believe that rank him really doesn't pointing guns at teenagers\nI'm so that primary version of a prank and visit the general election version of ... then we also have to understand and put into context what Stacey Abrams was saying and so in that context I think she was talking about who she intended to govern not necessarily who she was trying to get to vote for her\nWith with it and I leave it up to each person to decide whether Mets acquitted himself wealth or not last night but I Wonder the fact that we have a race that almost every poll suggested his neck and neck\nWhether just his very presence in this debate last night might be enough\nFor people who aren't really happy with you a Republican or Democrat to say well what's ahead if I'm going to vote I should throw my vote to the libertarian so of course in the debate the guys that were going to have a runoff it I Want you to vote for me to get us there\nWell I mean there there are number of issues to kind of think about that I think because this rain is going to be close regardless of who comes in first place or not because I think the margin is going to be so narrow that means that neither candidate has the type of Christian that necessarily guarantee that they're going to get over fifty percent so that's the place where he can play spoiler\nI'm sort of saying you know just for me to make sure that you know we have the right off I don't know if that's necessarily terribly convincing\nI suspect that's right but he does he could be a protest vote yes\nHe could be a protest that I mean if it were just on the merits of his performance my take on it that he was not ready for it was kind of unfortunate out of the campaign operatives\nHe take the country be protests that I mean if that were just on the merits of his performance my take on that he was not ready and I was kind of unfortunate I think\nThe campaign operatives I talked to were were not happy he was part of the debate and hopefully he won't be a part of the debate W S P in a week and a half but he will yeah you've already said they are going to bite him but but they were also thrilled with with [laughter]\nHow he came off because they're hopeful that those two percent numbers that he's at every poll even continue to shrink and thereby making it less likely to there's a runoff 'cause neither campaign is all that excited both of them want the knockout punch\n'em ... you know if there is rough it tends to favor the Republican in Georgia [laughter] um so so that's especially worrying for states have his campaign but the ... that the emphasis on hand for for a lot of different answers\nYou know he sort of became a laughing stock um and this was his first real event I mean he is if you compare this to four years ago when you have Andrew hunter who is actually out on the campaign trail we saw a lot of them you've got a lot of coverage gives out and about um ten minutes has not been out to nearly the level that the other libertarian candidates have been so it'll be harder for him to drive up his margin\nI Want to turn to another thing in the debate before we get to our next break and break it it comes down to you and your question which you said before you only had an opportunity you two questions for us that we should talk about one of them is I felt us to a great question of Brian Kemp\nOr you've been criticized for continuing your job as secretary of state and overseeing it'll lectured made your major participant in\nIf you're not going to step aside essentially you said it with the election approaching will you in fact step aside if there was a recount that was an interesting question\nYeah I really want her to get them on on on whether or not he felt like he could um partially a you continue to oversee the St elections which he said before and he said it again why um he said he had a job to do and he was elected to the job and he's going to do it but but state law requires the secretary of state's office to director recounts\nUm if if if if it's within the margin of I think its point five percent um and he said if it's a recount you know my office is very well equipped to do this or the state law requires me to do this I'll continue to do it which you know if we come down to that\nWill be a giant national story and we'll be able to look look back to this debate to see his answer on\nHer I said I've asked a question on this show repeatedly um why didn't camp anticipate this idea that other secretaries of state running for office heaven stepped aside but we've never had as much scrutiny on ballot security on an on issues regarding the ballot that we have\nThere is a state running for office heaven stepped aside but we've never had as much scrutiny on the ballot security on an on issues regarding the ballot but we have right now and have had for the entire year\nUh he could've set aside a long time ago he didn't but now just say well I'm Still secretary state even in a recount that strikes me as a something that voters might be a little nervous about\nWell I mean so here a couple of things to think about like flip that on its head I'm I'm\nPat full confidence that he's after the ... machine and can do this stuff without him and so if they can do it without him then why not excuse yourself from the products right because the suggest that you don't trust your staff I'm On the one hand and so there is some managerial issues that you may want to think about and then there are these larger optical issues to think about overseeing your own election\nThere's just something inherently unethical about this\nAnd and yeah there's no rule against it but just because it's not against the rules doesn't mean that it's necessarily bright and then there's the larger question to think about so not sort of you know what other people did before you why do we let partisans control the electoral process like this is something that I think many states need to seriously rethink\nI you know here's an example I thought we had an example I'll start with you on this re yesterday of where his candidacy and his office come into conflict\nOr we talked yesterday about this Rolling Stone tape\nThe tape was kept telling a private gathering you know they've Democrats are registering a lot of people they've been very successful they were getting them out to vote um we've got a pop up our vote operation and Rolling Stone put a spin on it somewhat diabolical this was something cap was doing\nIn a in a kind of an evil what what I heard was\nCandidate single supporters man they're energized we better get energized too that's fine except\nThat candidate is also the secretary of state and it seems to me a moment when those optics relieved look bad for him\nYes I agree with me and said that as you said it perfectly I mean it is a question of optics when I read that\nI thought well that he's right they have spent millions of dollars on this absentee ballot initiative and um you know they're seeing some a good turnout feedback on that so he's concerned about that he's trying to rally the troops because that thing they're most concerned about what\nIs uh their their base a voter\nBack on that so he's concerned about that and he's trying to rally the troops because the thing they're most concerned about\nIs uh\nTheir their base voters not being as motivated because they're in control of everything things look good we're not worried and a big part of them being you know Trump loyalist to their person's not on the ticket so maybe I'm going to stay home and look up industrial hemp and\nSee what it does [laughter] so uh [noise]\nYou know I I agree with you and I think that you know it may not matter you know they may be aware of the optics in in the end I think it doesn't matter\nAnd that's why they don't care for the enemy ... but in the context of you've been accused of voter suppression right it's just this is this a pile on for people to think that maybe ... perhaps are reading the election in your favor I I'm going to tell you what I think they're thinking oh they say that every election and it's you know\nPeople don't think it's true so we're not going to deal with\nIt so one note on how and why this device of this issue is the Democratic party Georgia released a poll while above left leaning a polling group so or take a kind of with a grain of salt but even that poll showed Georgians\nAlmost completely split it was like forty five forty four forty five or forty forty five on the issue of whether ... should should stuff that you\nGot a whole ... polling group that was really wrong on things like chalis Montgomery way way\nOut even that polling group a left leaning point we've had a a split non got as an overall any favorites\nI I Will say ... to our Facebook Live family 'cause that's where they become a an awful lot of them really comic comment on this repeatedly they think\nThat captured have recused himself a long time ago and I keep saying yeah that seems to have made sense some time ago you can't do it no right I mean it's just going to be what it is through the election ... out if there was you're right\nAnd then I Want you to be there right and my feeling is that whatever the outcome is of the election on November ... six that may dictate actually what happens and run off right because we have got\nA number of lawyers watching this election right on both sides and so this is ... there's a lot of scrutiny here um and so I don't there is no reason to believe that um that this is not going to be handled in a judicious manner and in a proper manner in a fair manner ultimately\nHope that their perception is shared\nAt um that this is not going to be handled in a judicious manner and in a proper manner in a fair manner ultimately\nLet's hope that their perception is shared by voters of the state because if we come away from the selection of feeling in any way that it hasn't been legitimately run it's it's very dangerous for all of us obviously so we'll watch and see how that turned jobs even follow we're going to take another break but\nThank you but you get a good time last night are covering this debate do new there's plenty to cover especially when\nAgain a fire alarm goes off and you notice grand was not faced at all well and the camera was right I knew I was watching you and you're like\n...
