Sunday Edition of the newspaper and then over seas political insider the blog add\nPolitical Georgia at my AJC dot com Hi Jim\nHow you doing great I'm great and 'cause I'm especially glad about today 'cause when we have the are two mayors panel it's always fun one of those mayors is of course Theresa Tamil uncertain of Columbus she's a Democrat although you run as a non partisan night you\nDid your let him do our intuition you're a lame duck lame duck container any Senate ... yeah I you mentioned that earlier and I said who scouting\n[laughter] if I have a good\nRental pour a is with us on Fridays ah she's a Republican strategist she worked for a governor Sonny Perdue she was his press secretary you\nWere the coach air Carly Fiorina's Georgia campaign plus all your other credentials in politics either right or I can hear you too and Sandy Springs mayor rusty Paul is back with us do you run not partisan and yes and yeah but you're a Republican yeah\nNow and and I want to take just a moment because you it's been a while since we've seen you on the show and and between the last time you were on and now my wife and I got to come and see a concert at your new city springs venue which isn't all municipal pride jagged him\nEleven hundred seat theater concern theater a black box\nIt it's it's a remarkable place congratulate\nWant to thank you uh when we needed a place where we could come together and build when I called the connective tissue of community and we didn't have that and uh the uh the reaction to the community is very similar to yours I was going to church the other day\nCalled the connective tissue of community and we didn't have that and uh the uh the reaction to the community is very similar to yours I was going to church the other day and I'm used to people asking me even at the altar what's going on Linda rode down and all a lady I said OK here comes as I Love the new one of\nThe well the reaction and I I wanted to even measure their property and gradually it should have also because I've spent a lot of my time trying to promote how important the arts are to everyday lives and uh and you're venue or does that congratulations okay let's get to work\nOur way I'm we're looking for early voting is underway and and it's really appropriate to start each show with at least a short report on where we stand\n'em as uh the end of the day yesterday\nAnd these numbers include a\nEarly voting in person which began last the last week and a absentee ballots\nThree hundred eighty two thousand nine hundred Georgians had been to the polls across the state which is an increase of a hundred Ninety four percent\nIn two thousand fourteen midterm only a hundred thirty thousand to voted out of the Georgia electorate they're done they're over this race yeah yeah so um it it ... one of the things we should point out and I want to ask for the uh the mayor's about this um\nIt's exciting Teresa that we see so so many people energized to get out and vote\nBut we don't necessarily know whether these are we certainly don't know whether we we don't know whether this means much because it's just people were in the habit of voting early\nWell looks like a couple of things there is some information that we can tell by the ... and it looks like we're getting a good number about thirty percent of those folks I give or take ... and ... counties\nBut thirty percent non veterans have already that if people did not vote and twenty fourteen to that's a good sign my initial observations are I Believe there's a lot of people who went early just to push that button as hard as they could\nUm because they feel very strong so tell us about that ... comments about the same we're at um almost I think it's like a hundred and fifty percent um and so we're we're doing great there's some counties at almost four hundred percent\nAt an early voting and that what you see it as one at a moderate everybody's expectations here they can't he see in some of the conservative north Georgia county ... that two hundred\nThree hundred percent I see it in some urban counties that's at\nAir they can't he see in some of the conservative north Georgia county as that two hundred\nThree hundred percent I say in some urban counties that sat two hundred three hundred percent four hundred per cent honest and on Clinton I ended up like that I think Stacey can say that she has worked it to turn as there is out because you're saying a very significant increase but what's interesting is are they ...\nAnd in that situation what people are looking for is encouragement and ... that somebody cares and that's what the president coming down does that's what why when we have storms and stuff you don't see me at the storm center you see me communicating with our community but here's what we're doing here's where things are happening here's where the problems are\nBecause that's what people are looking for what they're looking for some hope at that point\nAnd so the most important thing you can give people at that point is hope and then you've got to come in with with help pope has not enough and a Katrina changed the whole dynamic\nOf politics around these major storms and so if they change their diets equally because I I mean\nThere's nothing you can do in many cases my dad was a was a Red Cross disaster relief person when Katrina hit he loaded it struck up and was his crew and ready to go and they said stop\nWe have no place to ... we have no food to feed you or you're just simply going to be a drain on resources so sometimes you get help and you can't it it really causes problems so there's that you've got to be able to look at these disasters kind of incrementally the best thing you can do is rather than\nLoading up people in going in there right after a storm is really help the second responders Red Cross Salvation Army and those folks who are there and but but the president's job the governor's job the mayor's job\nIs to bring hope and let people know that we're doing something we're getting back on our feet and you just hang in there and we'll we'll we'll ... we'll be there\nSo let's talk a little about the political calculation and all this understanding that the people were down there right now have other concerns but but but politics has heart of everything in our lives now um\nI think about saying for bishop ... Democrat who is one in his district down there which is certainly a powerful district for years and years he's not going to be\nI think about saying for bishop ... Democrat who is one in his district down there which is certainly will district\nFor years and years he's not going to be in jeopardy or ... years down there working with people as you as best you can but but if if the president makes a visit and as we move forward say another two weeks to election day and people down there are still living with the kind of despair that we know they are\nGoing to have an impact on elections and all is well\nI think the scenario is going to play out over a longer period of time selection to write so and and the amount of time so when you heard President Trump if you listen to some of the video when he was down there talking to the farmers\nHe was saying what do you need how can I help you know and they were responding I don't have enough insurance to cover this\nI don't have you know enough of this that I Need to rebound and so\nYou know part of the reason for him being there too so that when secretary Perdue or one of the other cabinet secretary steps up to him and says we need to issue these grants to south Georgia or we need to issue these loans to south Georgia he understands why and it happened faster and we saw that happen\nSo he immediately went back to shoot you know and said those loans down and ... those loans grants are flowing into Georgia\nSo I think people in this circumstance ... in particular the farming community down there\nTo your point they're not thinking political sure right\nUm and I think that the electorate in general and Georgia is understanding I mean we've been through that so many times and other circumstances\nThat this is a scenario that is going to play out over time Jim but I'm Sorry did you want to say actually I Will say that al ... for example we saw Brian Kemp today announced that he's going to have a three day bus or to go down to south Georgia\nAnd so there's an implication there where he's got to go down and talk to these folks again he's been down there already once since the hurricane and in one capacity and now he's going down there and another capacity to speak with them um and that that part is about getting people to the ...\nI Will tell you what one of one of the way that this has helped probably Brian Kemp\nAnd that the and that is uh [noise] two three four months ago\nWe were all waiting for September October Tobar to feed the reaction of farmers\nWhen they pulled in soybean crop and couldn't send it to to try and murdered okay that is completely off the table not right I mean that is just a I don't think I heard a single person over the word terrorists do themselves Georgia in the last week\nThat's really an another and it strikes me\nSo you uh I don't think I heard a single person over the word terrorists down in South Georgia in the last week that is really an another it strikes me uh uh the other way may help or Brian Kemp is um we all we all thought it was quite likely that\nPresident Trump was going to come down through Georgia and make it part of his rally tour of red states and try to get Brian Kemp up on the stage with him and had one of his typical rallies which of course does fire up to research the Republican base but justice powerfully\nFires up the Democrats who don't like Trump\nThis way Kemp sort of get to the benefit of a presidential and vice presidential visit\nA without having to get the downside of those rallies which get so many people would flame\nYeah I you know I really think that Trump is so baked into this cake\nUm and I I agree with what a recipe was saying and that when the president comes even if he's not your guy just one and they're acting like the president for God's sake any any dead and and that's been done\nI don't know that that there's going to be a major flooding together Frank can't because Donald Trump that that I think the biggest impact the election is going to be that many of those democratic counties are without\nPower at the ones with the um the largest pop\nConcentrations of population in that general area I think that's a problem people's lives have been you know uprooted they're just turned upside down some of them in hotels or maybe they've gone to stay with the sister somewhere they're not even there to vote and you know when they will\nBe back and I think that's that disruption is is a real issue for the ... campaign but let me say Stacey had already announced how best to her and says she'll be down there too so again I think you see\nIt and you know it it's going to work for each of them in their own yeah\nRusty can I ask you a different aspect of visitors so\nUh in the middle of all this and and I said in introducing the show you know when you do this because you work with many candidates is former chair of the Georgia Republican Party is a former advisor to Jack Kemp\nOr you got to be so careful in how you speak to you both know that candidates that you find yourself saying something that you know just came out of your ... I Do which is hosted additional all the time\nTo Stacey Abrams is it makes this comment\nShe says uh we don't want you know we should have more job diversity more job possibilities for the people in Georgia people shouldn't have to work in agriculture in hospice\nUh we don't want you know we should have more job diversity more job possibilities for the people in Georgia people shouldn't have to work in agriculture and hospitality and\nBoy Republicans are counting on that hurt the kept people just put out another released Saturday saying we're coming down your way a at all Stacey Abrams thinks about is the fact that it's unfortunate you're stuck in these industries agriculture\nIs it's still Georgia's largest single industry\nAnd uh so uh you don't want to be on the wrong side of of that particularly I mean it you know Georgia still is a an extensively rural state in many ways\nA and and they have enormous pride in those rural areas and ah you know they're proud of what they do and they are essential not only to our economy but darn life\nSo anything that cast aspersions on the agriculture community in this state but look oh I was just said dumb things I mean haven't met one of the reasons I've never run for higher office because of ...\nYou you go and we're like okay and I mean I've told Jim all these years do not report what I say report what I intend to\nThem it it is it is\nA kind of she misspoke she you know and she knew it immediately did but still you still on video yeah mistakes like that you're going to make it clear what she wanted to say was it's fine to working agriculture or hospitality\nBut if you live in South Georgia those shouldn't be your only to ... ... and that's a that's a that is a there is a message that\nEvery economic developer or in in South Georgia could get behind yeah up but the problem is you're you're also dealing with a with a with a with a region\nThat's a little bit beleaguered and when you get beleaguered you'd get defensive pure and I'm and I'm sure that's what's so that that's what the ... people are currently about ... ...\nYou know to me it kind of signal to I Know that she knows that the two largest tend to strengthen our state I Know that intellectually she has that I also know that she has probably been speaking another circle largely about economic mobility as a policy and that sort of a high brow concept that doesn't play well when you're on the stump\nAnd sell it and I'm speaking out as a party and I'm speaking to somebody that had to learn this myself as an aide to governor cause heart and soul last rats with a land break 'em and who married into farming\nPicking on his part is and I'm speaking to somebody that had to learn this myself as an aide to governor who's heart and soul less rests with the Land Rover um and who married into farming\nUm that you have to walk the walk and you have to be with the people and understand and farming in the state is not just a livelihood farming and the state is a way of life and NATO's about lineage so all these farms that had been devastated\nMany of these families aren't giving up on farming because they intend to pass it down just as it was passed down to them and in tourism we are recognized and I've learned this from my economic development days we are recognized around the world for our hospitality\nNot only our culture of hospitality but aren't the services we provide we've set up schools to train people to specifically go into the hospitality field\nAnd so you know she really miss stepped on this one and it would it show to me is that she just hasn't been out there enough in the trenches are really talking to people\nAnd learning on a lower level or size average\nNot that I've never had that that particular attitude a I think the more people boat the merrier but let me let me give you an anecdote\nBrian and how he's he has built firewall between the campaign and what's going on for two weeks off I Want it in because I had somebody who was looking for him to come visit so I just wanted to state jobs I spent some time dumped capitals you all know\nAnd I went in and said this is talk of the schedulers and I said to him I taught them and they said I don't want it was about as well we can't talk to you about that you need to call these people because that's being done over there and we don't do that here\nAnd so do you have to have a far wall between what's going on in ... states office on a day to day basis in the campaign so he has built some protections in there so that that those kinds of overlaps with you but I don't usually see\nPain so he has built some protections in there and so that that those kinds of\nOverlaps which one but I'm not unusual to see he hasn't he hasn't elaborated on them is not verbalize now but that firewall no\nThat's it that's it there and that ... that are in a state why can't that that's I mean that's exactly how it was on governor pretty was running for office at that as someone on the governing side you did not talk about anything that had to do with the campaign and vice versa\nI got to get to another break but before I Do I ... I understand all of these arguments but I Would suggest this\nOr whether it's this week next week we're on November ... there are people who will go to the polls and vote\nAgainst Stacey Abrams because they're farmers are hospitality workers who thinks she insulted them and they're furious were there for doing it and there will be people who will vote against Brian Kemp because they think he is manipulated his use of the secretary of state's office to hold down votes so perception\nBecomes incredibly important we all agree with that I guess\nRight now are are they new voters okay [laughter] I knew it would have to get in the la [laughter]\nWe're gonna take it other break and we'll be right back [noise]\n\nI Am Ira Flatow and this week on science friday a sleep scientists spill the beans on insomnia night ... one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles from the\nWind genes may decide your bedtime on science friday from anywhere in the studio\nThree o'clock this afternoon on G. P. B. and C. P. B. news dot org\n[noise]\nWelcome back to political rewind we've got a great panels at age Im Galloway a is here\nTheresa Tomlin said in the mayor of Columbus were rattled poor Republican strategist in so much more\nRusty Paul former chairman of the Georgia Republican Party a and the mayor of Sandy Springs longtime are associated the great Jack Kemp Republican or Democrat you had to love Jack Kemp [laughter] uh Theresa I Want to give you the reason you got to ask\nIs because you said coming in\nI on with oh two Republican [laughter] and it's because if any democratic hold their own mom is the uh\nMan with two Republican [laughter]\nThat is because if any democratic hold their own laws is the life of course [laughter]\nI'm All right we want to remind you all out there that we are coming to savannah on October thirtieth and I think I've said this before we are told that this venue that we're doing it at the Jewish education alliance I think is the right word for that is a filling up fast\nYou do still have time to register and come to see us on the thirtieth\nYou can see that you can come to G. P. B. dot org slash community for reservations Tuesday October thirtieth\nSeven P. M. we really Jim we have so much fun in Savannah and the coastal league of women voters really really get excited about the house yeah and and now it's you know you almost feel like you're important and I wouldn't want to go that far\nBut we're going to have to watch what we say spontaneous lay down their alright I'm I Want to turn to one another matter that has to do with this whole question of\nYou know so called voter suppression gym or we know that the other day we talked about this on Wednesday show Jefferson County had a strange incident where a senior citizen a set or tried to get people on a bus so they could go vote early on the bus was turned back\nBy county officials who believed it was a partisan exercise being led by a democratic uh official in the party in the county the seniors but he'll get off the bus you'll have to vote some other time Stacey Abrams she went and\nSaw those folks that are very very modest [laughter] I mean I mean she she went on to the ... is it a ... percent\nTo see those folks she happened to bring a couple of network cameras with her and and and and it all worked out for her at all but it did it did it did kind of feed what what you were saying earlier is that is that is that democratic message of of of data of they'd rather not see you vote\nWhich is intended to make you want to vote even harder yeah\nI'm All right I'm\nBull get off the governor's race a couple of quick notes uh Loretta yeah on Monday Marco Rubio is going to be in Cobb County voting I'm voting for supporting a a camp they'll rally with camp and according Booker is going to be here in Atlanta on Sunday for a Stacey Abrams um\nAny kind of thoughts about Rubio as a post\nIn Atlanta on Sunday for a Stacey Abrams um any kind of thoughts about Rubio as opposed to Booker every bookers kind of\nHeld up as this and liberal shovel with by Republicans whereas you know Marco Rubio\nHe did he use the guy who talked about Trump small hands where do you make of you\nKnow I mean look you know\nWell if you're going to look at where they are on the partisan spectrum Cory Booker certainly is to the left\nOn the part isn't spectrum and he demonstrated such during recent hearings 'em and Marco Rubio has been more of a centrist he's very conservative socially but uh when it comes to foreign policy and other issues he's very central he's in Cobb County because he won Cobb County when he was running for president\nDemocrats who say that a victory burger was a hero in the middle there are there are two numbers that explain everything here okay one number is Tony Tony the other number it's twenty twenty four\n[laughter] All right okay so so so they're both making they're they're they're they're they're they're making bones with with the people that they have to make if they want to have a chance in their ... to ... go ahead and and and I would say that that this is a smart play by the ... campaign because\nThis is ... ... ... if if camp is going to escape is weak in the northern parks in the verbs marker roads Rubio is the perfect person to rally Republican voters\nWell he also is very close to Jeff Duncan Jeff Duncan when he played right a Florida Marlins they were very close friend or you're going to be overly cargo to me right down the street on may ... you know I Try not to cross the river bad things happen but I'm\nGoing to make an exception and Teresa with Stacey Abrams with all this\nYou know I've never been event with her but I've done some things certainly I'm trying to do my part for the campaign and the cars\nYou know I Will say when it comes to a Rubio Marco Rubio or or Cory Booker they're just playing to their base getting its national attention it's all fun it makes it all LA is George and the national discussion that's great\nBut I have to say something about you what you just left related to the Jefferson County by smoking things exactly what I was talking about about the one man one vote let's expand the electorate make sure everybody votes versus oh we can't be so ... and now here I you know there are those people were adults that this was not a daycare center and a and they want\nOh we can't be so parts and now here\nI you know there are those people were adults that this was not a daycare center and I and they want it it was ... it was a non profit organization that that by the fact that there was somebody involved that may be and it's all of the Democratic party but that ... shutdown\nWas it was deemed to be partisan strategic effort because it was an African American\nI mean there's no question there was a symbol of this whole notion of whether there's been voter suppression\nAlright so look I let's change the subject of higher early do we all agree that the amount of time we spend paying attention to this election cycle to the Trump White house to the Congress fighting day and night usually means we really need to drink more and there\nWere you specially wish we could drink earlier on Sunday and that is\nThe subject but both of you and your cities are going to address the ankle brace ill or the most or whatever you want to have a mandate to most submitted first of all what does it do essentially this basically this uh this allows a restaurants\nTo serve alcoholic beverages with meals before noon yeah correct in the earlier so windy minutes ... minutes earlier\nRemembering that how when ... when did we allow Sunday liquor sales of any kind of it's been within the last decade I mean\nI Am trying to I'm trying to remember it's been longer than that haven't been by ... I tell you what if there's nothing that symbolizes the change current and Georgia that there is not\nPitchforks and torches uh about drinking", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "19"}
