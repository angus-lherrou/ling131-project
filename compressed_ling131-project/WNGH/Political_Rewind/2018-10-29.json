Nye did um [noise] I Want I Want to start very briefly by saying I'm I don't like to talk personally is too often on the show but um I Will tell you that I'm I'm Jewish\nLike to talk personally is too often on the show but um I Will tell you that I'm\nI'm Jewish my wife and kids are Jewish and this has been a very rough couple of days in our family has it has been for Jewish families across the country and uh and really we don't have to be Jewish too have had a very difficult time\nFor the last couple of days I'm In the same way that you didn't have to be African American but you felt it more than others after the mother Emanuel church massacre [laughter]\nUm or any time any Muslim was dealt with a violent to hate crime in their community\nAnd so we're going to start the show today by talking a bit about hatred in America\nAnd how we can look at getting past this awful awful time\nIn our lives are so I Know it's not that we're not talking about campaign politics at the very top of the show we will get to that because the election is going to go on and we need to talk about what's happening in the final week of the election cycle\nBut let's get started by talking a bit about what happened in Pittsburgh on Saturday um we've got a a course Jim Galloway here the lead Political Report or a writer for the AJC\nJim I thank you for being you hit reunite traded messages on Saturday and I I appreciated the fact that you were aware of what a difficult day it was especially for Jewish Americans\nRight and and and anyone with a sense of history I'm going to be upset and will will will come into the the the Atlanta has experience this with with the temple bombing or in a bit yeah we'll\nDo that during the show as well Jim of course appears in the Wednesday and Sunday newspaper and oversees the political inside our blog\nAt politically Georgia my AJC dot com right across from him in the studio tag dream a Republican\nStrategist who's got a couple of candidates in this election cycle and um who's spending all last week thinking about that we're glad you're here today to I'd always a pleasure thanks bill and Howard Franklin democratic political strategist is here as Well hi Howard good afternoon guys\nSo let's talk a little gym um [noise] what it is it oh I didn't introduce Allison ... see this is why Galloway is a great a side man here Alice\nOh I didn't introduce Allison could be a good match the this is why Galloway is a great a side man here\nAllison ... Goodman is the southeast regional director of the Anti Defamation league and Allison we're very glad you're here even though I didn't introduce you to the very start found that if he has so let's start with you actually a first of all\nYeah we're not seeing a twenty Seventeen we did not see a number of violent assault against is what we saw a huge spike in the number of incidents around harassment in vandalism these types of kind of everyday easier actions that people can take\nThat maybe don't take that extra step into violence to Saturday with ...\nThe euro erode every a lot and Emory has for a long long time been ground zero for a lot of this very kind of behavior there's a strong Jewish presence on the campus\nBut over the years there have been people who have targeted that Jewish student body with the kind of things Allison is talking about swastikas anti Jewish messaging so it's something you're pretty aware of I think that\nThat's true and I want to I Want to go back to something you were hearing earlier about it was either you or Jim I Can't recall I'm about there being you know the ... the adult in the room or the father figure talking us through this I had that experience on on Sunday um but\nI don't necessarily think that the government is the only place to look for moral leadership I agree with when we heard ... um give a moving a prayer coming out of retirement and peach tree road United Methodist church and that's where I look for for moral leadership um\nThe hyper partisanship that that uh Howard mentioned this is something that is not just since two thousand sixteen it had been it had been brewing for a number of years\nI'm not saying it's President Obama's fault I'm not saying is President Trump's fault I'm saying it's something that has built up over at least a decade and we have all all\nUs as political actors whether we're just a normal voters or whether we are consultants who may get\nAt least a decade and we have all all of us as political actors whether we're just a normal voters or whether we are consultants who may get carried away with this guy used um of what of what the people on the streets are talking about we've all contributed to that\nAnd we can all be part of changing that but\nWhen Jim talks about political correctness as a set of sort of genteel rules under which we have our civic debate I think that was true at one point I think at some point in the nineties and accelerating through uh the last decade the idea of political correctness and that there are words you can say there are\nSentiments you can't harbor inside your brain ... even if not acted upon has become a casualty to use against\nPeople who believe differently um and again that's not just a right wing\nA phenomenon that's not just a left wing phenomenon it something that a lot of people have done it becomes easier to do it publicly now because you can do it publicly from behind as a small screen or ah or behind a larger screen at your desk [noise] um\n[noise] but we've all contributed to it every time that we don't say\nI'm not comfortable with that [noise] I don't I don't want to eat you can't say that in front of me\nSo I'm I Want to read you said we have to look for a leaders who are outside of government I think that's right I'm Greg loose deems rabbi posted it or or wrote a note is that a Greg put out on Twitter and I read tweeted on the politics gp beside [noise]\nAnd here's what his rabbi said our people have been targets of attack for millennia we have so many ways to protect ourselves or fight back we will continue to do so\nUltimately our greatest response to those who seek to hate or destroy us and our greatest victory over them has been refused to submit to fear but rather to continue to live to learn to pray and to sustain our heritage that has a response to that is within the grasp of each of us today Allison your thoughts on what you what he said\nYeah I mean we we do need to kind of come together around this and I should say\nWe have been really I'm blessed to have received so many outpouring of solidarity from all communities in Atlanta um we've gotten beautiful messages from I'm from several churches from the Islamic speakers bureau\nFrom Planned Parenthood from she's based groups and you know political non political um community members\nFrom the Islamic speakers bureau from Planned Parenthood from issues based groups and you know political non political um community members passed interns people are just showing up right now and that's exactly what they need to be doing\nIf I could if I could jump in and just kind of response to what Tom was saying is ... ... yeah we we we have a government isn't the only source of leadership that we could that that\nThat uh again it's not the only source of leadership that we need right now certainly but we're we're living in a society that is more and more secular\nOr in a society in which really religious leadership quite frankly carries less and less weight within a community\nAnd to me that makes it more important for for for political figures across the spectrum I mean you know I Want to hear from Nathan Deal I Want to see Nathan Deal in the pulpit talking about this I Want to see Johnny Isaacson\nIn a pool but talking about this I Want to see David Perdue I Want to I Want you know I Want I wanted to see a a a a Michael Thurman\nYeah I think that's a good point and and and Howard uh we we have to get these ... I Do think there is just some synagogues are now planning their services to to remember what happened over the weekend so ... there's time for these leaders the gyms to argue about to step forward but they ought to yeah\nI totally agree I I went\nTo Charleston after the massacre there a couple of years ago and a broad\nUm array of leaders who saw fit to weigh in on this tragedy and I are in weighing on the troubled mind that was able to conceive killing people in a church I think it was useful to the discourse I I don't I wouldn't\nSay on this show promote any sort of false equivalence I Do want to talk more about kind of where Todd is on the all all of us having a responsibility in a row for because I think there's also the the prominence of backlash from people do speak out right after it it's such a\n... it's such a chicken and egg question as such a you know ... kind of a revolving we'll because I I Do think there are plenty of people leaders organizations who do try to speak out on a ... and sometimes they get\nLabeled as the political correctness police or you know other things also maybe ... maybe thrown at them so I'm really curious I think this is a difficult and a thorny question to answer especially when you include the layer of politics and\nYeah and we're going to go ahead of time I was going to say that to gyms point\nIs a difficult and a thorny question to answer especially when you include the layer of politics and yeah and we're going to go ahead of\nTime I was going to say that to gyms point that the the problem when lifting up our secular leaders as\nMoral authorities in some way is that you eventually get to one who disagrees with you\nAnd is only accountable to a better majority of ... or electoral college and and and so by by saying that we're going to look to the political leadership for a moral guidance you're you're empowering the next guy whom you may not agree with\nThat I I hear that accept a ... that's exactly what you're Trump does he plays to his base and his base alone so he will never be able to be a great unite or because his messaging is always to the people who support him and you know that um [noise]\nAnd and part of the issue is strikes me there ... look we've all accepted for some time now that it just isn't in his DNA\nTo be a healer and a great moral or a leader who can bring us together as a people Ronald Reagan knew how to do it after challenger so Peggy Noonan speech which he wrote for him and he delivered so beautifully and with such feeling was an example of that they did nothing to do with [noise]\nYou know kids playing to his base you know he talked about the astronauts who were killed and challenger going off to touch the face of God\nI mean powerful Brock Obama after Sandy Hook I think Galloway point is correct so the trade off I Believe you get with President Trump is for those who are supporters of his is we're going to get our Supreme Court justices were going to get our conservative agenda [noise]\nOkay so he's not going to be the unite or we accept that\nBut but but I Would say that that when you when you say that Reagan speech the magic of that speech was not just that it was delivered by of by a very fine actor or than it was written by one of the preeminent words miss a of of our lifetime it's that you referred to eternal\nUm moral standard right I had an aunt and and that is something that has been I Would argue drummed out of much of our of our severe ...\nI I'm Alison I Want to um [noise] I'm frankly you know one of the things we know about you have to I'd have a major league as you are not a partisan organization and so to some extent I I kind of wander ... from what\nBut frankly you know one of the things we know about your ... you are not a partisan organization and so to some extent I got a water walls you off what is going to become a bigger more partisan conversation after we finish your segment with you so what's come back to you I'm\nA deal marks all views things you can monitor them how to fight back you up programs like no place for hate what are you doing to try to change the climate deal\nSure so we are engaging people and dialogue and discussion about difference and identity and how to stand up to bigotry and hate at all levels\nEvery single day and with a number of different types of constituents so no place for hate we work in over two hundred schools in the region but thousands nationwide where touching millions of students across the country and teaching them how to speak up against hate when they see it happen\nUm we have a really great resource on line about a power empowering young people in the aftermath of hate that's actually for educators students are parents\nAnd so you know there is a difference between journalism and the journalistic entertainment right Tom fly\nGrant you that the gym where the reason that they're such anger and hatred in this country\n... I'll tell you there are two two things that bothered me number one was a ... that you read it and and that there is an implied bargain there [noise]\nYou start saying nice things about me the president was saying and ... and things will come down out that the hatred will stuff [noise]\nUh you get you do one you get the other um [noise] I'm not sure number one that he's in control of that uh and uh so uh so I'm not sure that it is that it's something that we can even if it we can even entertained I Will tell you what the you know the the tweet that bothered me most\nUh on on Saturday from the president was a his decision to discuss ah the the pitching shortcomings of the LA down ... yes I mean just uh\nI mean you read it out they should not have pulled their starting pitcher for reliever you're you're you're you're in in\nYes I mean just uh yeah I mean you either now that they should not have pulled their starting pitcher for reliever you're you're you're you're\nIn in one tweet you are trying to trying to at least making an attempt to convey some sympathy and empathy about what's happened in Pittsburgh and then you're off to the world series\nI think the the really ironic part of his entire display is that you've got a guy who actually became a public figure by being an entertainer on television and now he is complaining that he's not being taken seriously although he does so many\nYou know cartoonish things whether it's on Twitter or behind\nThe podium for a political rally not I don't I'm not saying that the person doesn't have the right but I but I think in any of it\nAs a member of either party you have to realize that the statements you're making has some consequence people have the ability to weigh in and they give you and the and the broader public what they believed to be a ... the substance or lack there of when you're\nBehind that Mike from so uh in talking about how the president has dealt with this weekend a for good and ill or I was thinking about Jim ... one of the worst act of terrorism in the United states which took place here\nI Am and I'm putting that in a historical perspective at the time it was one of the worst acts of terrorism uh in October of Nineteen fifty eight\nThe Hebrew benevolent association the temple one of the oldest Jewish congregations in the state of Georgia I'm was bombed\nAt three in the mornings uh some I think there were like twenty pounds or something at AT T is a fifty fifty six of dynamite of blew off the side of the building thank God no one was killed but it shocked\nThe Atlantic community at the time because it was such an overt uh and raging sign of hatred against juice and it was\n... you know I mean this is if if your if your favorite movie buff this is what driving miss daisy was about to actually\nWrite the AC is coming to temple to uh come to a surface and they pull up and stop people remember the scene and and uh hulk the driver says we we can go in\nThere as a mom [noise] um but uh but but it it did two things that were two things to come out on that bombing number one is I mean it was all a rabbi Rothschild who's leaving the congregation at the time I mean he was All right\nIt it did two things that were two things have to come out and bought me number one is I mean it was all a rabbi Rothschild who's leading the congregation at the time I mean he was already making a mark\nFor himself as as a as a proponent of desegregation ah which which in essence made made the temple a target there [noise]\nUh so it it it kind of illustrated the union of causes between between religious freedom and and racial justice yes and and\nLet me let me just play for a minute I'm\nSome sound of from ... morning October twelfth over twelve Nineteen fifty eight mayor William Hartsfield uh went immediately to the temple he grabbed a W. S. B. TV microphone and talked into their film camera and said this my\nSo uh that was then mayor William Hartsfield of Atlanta attempt house just told me that it's crossed wires that President Trump is heading to Pittsburgh or tomorrow a bill Hartsfield wouldn't be a bad model for him for how to deal in the aftermath of this sort of thing Todd [noise] I\nI I agree with that I think that um [noise] I think that there is a there is a place for for measured um statements like that but again I I just I just don't [noise]\nI I just don't pay that much attention to Washington I don't pay that much attention to Twitter really the the last time I think I looked at Twitter on my cell phone was probably the last time I was here\nUm and and that's part of the discretion that that I advocate is when people are have turned a medium into assessed pit well get out of it quits quit swimming in it uh it's done wonders for my peace of mind\nNeal if I could ... it just it in fifty eight when when Hartsfield said that he wasn't talking I mean he wasn't reacting to to just a little little tidbits of social media he wasn't responding to to Twitter messages he was he was responding to a very real political climate\nTo just a little little tidbits of social media he wasn't responding to to Twitter messages he was he was responding to a very real political climate that was actually that actually had the upper hand\nIn the south I mean you had a ... we weren't too far removed from the days of gene Talmud which are from the last lynching a in Georgia and uh and uh it it it just\nHe was taking a very definitive risky was stepping out at all he was\nOne of the remarkable things about this is that I'm\nClear Frank was lynched the Jewish merchant who was convicted of murdering a young uh Marietta girl a in his pencil factory um he was lynched he was pulled out of jail and millage ville brought back to Marietta and lynched\nAnd the Jewish community Atlanta started leaving in droves because they were terrified of what was happening around them which is kind of the atmosphere that Jim was talking about [noise]\nAnd one of the reasons that people were so afraid is that a nobody came to their defense outside the Jewish community now the beauty of the temple bombing was it was a book and in the aftermath of the temple bombing in fact led by William Hartsfield\nThan non Jewish the Christian Community did come together and did offer there a support\nTo the people at the temple so in in fact Hartsfield was a foreigner or for a movement\nThat we're taking a very large time hours before it came to real fruition and some would say it may not have\nCome out of it yet but it was an incomplete booking shows\nBecause uh they had five suspects in the case only one was tried twice acquitted ... cases were drunk yes but but the point is that Hartsfield took a ... a brave stand not playing to his base\nRight and I think you guys underscored it very well I think taking a political risk and speaking to the moment in a way that was meaningful to a lot of folks whether or not they were getting that message through multimedia\nOr ... I you know I completely feel your pain as it relates to him to media I guess my concern is is that people aren't leaving it right it it's obviously got all sorts of issues we talk about and we've seen in a in the news you know leaders who have said things that have gotten boots\nAnd it's just that people aren't leaving it right it it's obviously got all sorts of issues we talk about and we've seen in a in the news\nYou know leaders who have said things that have got booted from social media et cetera but it doesn't seem like the millions if not billions of people who are still using it to get their news are using it to spread their views are stepping back from the microphone away from their computers\nBut I Can't control what they do I can only control what what I Do and I can only control what I suggest other folks do\nUm I I Would say to to gyms point about the chronology we were also it was also several years before a Lester Maddox was a rise to prominence so it was it wasn't just like a stopping point and now George is on the right track but I I think there's some level at which ah Hartsfield had been dealing with\nThe underlying tensions and and I think that that\nAt that time the the racial issue was probably the greatest the greater of the\nOf well in fact the great rabbi ... ... or Jake abrupt child who was a great hero it in a civil rights leader in this town was also the guy who had and Martin Luther king junior won the Nobel Peace prize and the rest of Atlanta the business community turned their back on him it was Jacob Rothschild his wife Julie nice\nUh the Coca Cola company that came forward forward and said we're going to honor this man this is an extraordinary achievement and that to Howard was a turning point in the business community's relationship\nTo the African American community absolutely I mean that a storied\nStory a narrow narrative a retelling and I mean I I\nAm a ... eleven we went to Israel or in many ways was reminded of all of the partnership that have grown from oppression frankly an for from having each other's backs and", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "29"}
