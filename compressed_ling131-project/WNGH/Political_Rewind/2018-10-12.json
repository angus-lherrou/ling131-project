introduce\nJim Galloway he's the lead political writer of buzz of e AJC and a is a regular here on Mondays and Fridays you also you read them on Wednesdays and Sundays in the dead tree edition of\nThe up AJC any overseas the political in sight or block Jim great to have you here for a welcome to fall ... who is gp bees legislative a correspondent a wider to be here today I I assume that in the last\nYear or so you've you've covered Stacey Abrams down at the state Capitol Hill\nOr yes indeed I think everybody is talking about this race\n... and as we get started if I could tell if a guy or the folks in the control room that were there we go we're getting a bad feedback or we only want to hear our voices one son this year oh today Welcome\nStacey Abrams it's a real pleasure to have you here thank you for having me I Do need to point out as I have when we've promoted the show before we did invite Brian Kemp\nA to also appear on political rewind his campaign said he was not going to do it that he doesn't have enough time I talked to Bryan about it personally and he basically said the same thing so if the imitation was extended to him and we're glad you accept that\nLet's talk issues check\nYou said over and over that you're going to in fact say at nausea and perhaps that Medicaid expansion is the most crucial certainly right up there in the top couple of issues in your campaign [noise] um what is Medicaid expansion really mean\nThe most crucial certainly right up there in the cutoff couple of issues in your campaign [noise] um what is Medicaid expansion really mean what should people know about that and and then was hurt but some of the challenges you may have to deal with if you're elected on that score\nSo let's let's set the stage right now in the state of Georgia we spend about one point seven billion dollars on people who are sick\nBut can't afford health insurance and he'll go and get health care anyway\nAnd when I say we have I mean every single Jordan when your property taxes go up when you pay income tax you're paying for those folks us because our health care system in America is based on health insurance\nMedicaid expansion was part of the Affordable CARE Act one part credit the exchanges and where people can buy private insurance but for those who are considered to poor for existing Medicaid but\nUm who who make too much for existing medicate but we are too poor for private insurance\nMedicaid expansion said we're going to provide them access to insurance as well because that will cover their cost and actually reduce the costs for everyone in the state of Georgia that means four hundred and Seventy three thousand people who make more than seven thousand dollars and less than roughly Seventeen thousand dollars\nAnd a lot of these are working people who have one or two jobs but they don't get health insurance from their employers they would be eligible for Medicaid\nIf we accept Medicaid expansion the state of Georgia puts in one dollar we draw down nine dollars but when all end that's two hundred and fifty million from the state and we drove down three billion dollars with that money recover four hundred and Seventy three thousand George is with health insurance we create fifty six thousand jobs\n... sixty percent of which are outside of Metra Atlanta\nAnd we see a six billion dollar economic output through the state of Georgia\nShow is you know governor deal or rejected expanding Medicaid on the basis that in the long run it would cost Georgia too much money I'm ... years of the Fed's pay for the bulk of it for a number of years but eventually the state will take over more and more of the obligation\nAnd really that's not true okay so so it it's true in fact but not the reality is what started out was that if we done this and fourteen that the feds would have paid one hundred percent because we're now down to the feds paying Ninety three percent but the cap is it the feds will always pay at least Ninety percent\nAnd so we've already missed the moment where we were going to have to pay more so when I'm Talking about is the worst case scenario we're putting in one dollar and drawing down nine dollars it used to be we put a nothing in return\nMiss the moment where we were going to have to pay more so when I'm Talking about is the worst case scenario we're putting in one dollar and drawing down nine dollars it used to be we put in nothing and we do down ten dollars\n[laughter] let me ask you you have a Medicaid expansion is being held by by many people who are really worried about rural Georgia yeah and and and the state of health care of their ... and you were in a political season and the political weight of Georgia is above I twenty how do you get\nTo get the answers that they can make certain that they can stand foursquare behind this project\nSo um I Want to turn to another one of the big priorities that you've been discussing that education you um first of all you have made it clear that uh if you become governor the hundred million dollars that the legislature is set aside to provide scholarships essentially\nFor students and to go into a non public settings eyes grown away you don't want to continue that you want to put your focus on public education my correct\nI Believe that public dollars should be spent for public education okay um so you also have ... I guess I Would call a holistic approach a ... 'cause you know Mr Abrams\nCertainly Galloway and I and ... are a little more recently we've all watched the governor's for many many years with education reform plans if you have two and a governor comes along proposes a plan and the next governor changes that up\nAnd tell us what this holistic approach you're discussing you're looking at it as an entire communities ability to engage with students in a way that we wouldn't necessarily consider the academic approaches that a fair way of\nSaying I think it's a fair way of saying it and it comes about and part because of the hard work I did working with Governor deal and the legislature and sometimes in opposition when it came to the opportunity school district\nWe know that the current funding formula it's inadequate I'm proud that it was finally fully funded this year but it was written forty years ago for a very different student body for a very different state\nWe know it's more expensive to educate children who come from low income homes to speak English as a second language a special needs are we live in rural communities and therefore we have to update our formula to reflect this knowledge\nFirst or you were saying you will take on a asking the legislature\nFor communities and therefore we have to update our formula to reflect this knowledge\nFirst are you are saying you will take on a asking the legislature to redo crawl over you basically education which governor deal would say he was going to do and never realized that he was going to have a hard time doing it\nAnd it's going to be difficult but it's necessary because we have certain counties that are donor counties that have changed since composition and are unable to meet their basic responsibilities plus we have a different student base than we did before and we're very we're much larger state\nAnd so I Believe that we have to tackle this we don't need to do another commission or we I was there when the governor Perdue did his commission when\nGovernor ... um deal that his commission I think we have commission information off the next job implementation and thinking about how do you craft of legislation that actually reflects the best values\nBut holistic education is critically important because if a child comes to class on Monday and the last time they ate was on friday Nathan the best teacher can't teach that child\nAnd we know that we have to think about the whole needs as a child mental health nutritional issues health care issues transients one of the issues that Atlanta has tackled is that we have school districts where children are moving from apartment to apartment every thirty days because their parents can find affordable housing\nThese are not solutions that have to be isolated from one another and I think Atlanta in Marietta have both come up with really innovative ways to start to address these issues what I'm saying is we have to bring the solutions together public private partnerships aren't just for infrastructure building it's how we build the best and strongest societies\nAre approach to attach to your approach to public education\nThere is I think long term there will be a different price tag no we have today I Do not know exactly what it is because I think part of it is figuring out how much can the public sector provide what responsibilities can we ask the nonprofit sector to contribute to work in the private sector step and where it has not\nBut I Do know that we have to make this a priority we are losing the race in the state of Georgia we had a great graduation rate but we still have too many kids who do not achieve at the levels and that's a mile since we need them to hit\nFor this to be a strong sustainable educational system for kids but\nWe um compost just told me we've got to get a very short break a thirty second break out of the way so we're going to do that right now and come back with more with democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams\nOf getting rid of your old car truck van or RV usually these legal donation program is you're held donating has never been easier will take care of everything\nOld car truck van or RV ... vehicle donation program is you're held donating has never been easier will take care of everything including ... pick out of your vehicle is good at ... dot org slash cars or call a seven seven genes may be one car and thank\nListening to an\n[noise]\nWelcome back to political ... joined today by your attorney oh candidate Stacey Abrams which is a real pleasure to have you here since it happened and we've already gotten some notes from various people out there on Facebook and Twitter yes as I said it'd be they're gonna show we did invite her opponent Brian Kemp to appear as well the ... campaign took advantage of our invitation\nThat Kim campaign did not Jim gallery you got a question\nFor the journal constitution and gentle do actually new news has a new poll out this week\nUh speeds in horse race terms that shows sill shows you as you and Mr Kemp it in a dead heat within the margin of error of each other there are a couple of aspects that are very interesting but I think\nShe is leaning against a among go male voters fifty three to forty three percent nearly living among women voters with fifty point four percent which which in in in talking with with other Democrats who is it's that's a number of the needs to be improved upon and at the core of that\nIs you've got a white female voters still a number one uh\nExpressing approval for Donald Trump I mean this is after me too and this is after the Kavanaugh hearings and with sixty four percent giving him an approval ratings sixty four percent Kemp they're giving in ... there are there going for camp by sixty nine percent [noise] ah [noise]\nHow do you address that in the next three weeks ...\nThat polls are good roadmap that they are not protected\nIf you look around the country like if you look around the country we've had races that have been decided this year by margins that were unexpected including my own race and my primary and what I Know is the polls tell us what's possible\nAnd they tell us places where we can improve but we are not running a race that had these single scenario idea I'm Talking to everyone everywhere I've been to a hundred and fifty nine counties\nWe are reaching out to communities that rarely\nBut we're not running a race that has a single scenario idea I'm Talking to everyone everywhere I've been to a hundred and fifty nine counties\nWe're reaching out to communities that rarely hear from candidate but we're doing so in a way that's consistent the same conversations I was having at the beginning of the campaign I'm having them now I haven't pivoted I haven't had to soften or just my image I've been able to run a consistent campaign and that is why we're in within the margin of error together\nBut going forward I'm going to continue to do the work necessary to actually turn out our voters that is how you win by turning out voters in every community of every stripe\nOn on one of the issue questions though do you do see asked on on on who do do a better best with health care\nI mean clearly you have spoken more about health care and Medicaid expansion ... you know maybe maybe on a racial nine to one over over Mr Kemp and your voters voters pretty much our our our DOMA line I was saying goes ... an equal number so Kemp would be a would be better\nOr fixing healthcare menu [noise]\nHow do you how to address that\nBy how do you how do you how do you go from from I guess from tone to loving to twelve\nBut again I I take every poll was the seriousness that I should\nBut I also recognize that when I'm Down in ... county when I'm over in Stuart counting the number of people who are turning out to have these conversations you've never voted\nWho've never been engaged they are turning out in record numbers in part because they're not included in a lot of these polls they are not the voters who are considered likely voters so they're not being added into this narrative\nAnd that's part of the way we win by having this conversation with everyone I don't doubt that people see both of us and use their ideological backgrounds to decide where they said\nBut the responsibility of every good campaign and the responsibility I take on as a future leader of the state of Georgia is I've got to talk to everyone every day about health care about education about jobs I Want to go back ... go ahead of joy ...\nShould also very very important to you the partnership between police and community and went through Rogers wants to know what are your plans for increasing police accountability in addition what are your thoughts on the civilian review board to investigate police misconduct and brutality\nWhen it comes to a partnership with law enforcement as deputy city attorney I was responsible sometimes for writing the rules that were implemented by the police and so I have a very deep respect for a law enforcement and if you look at my record I worked hard to maintain a focus on public safety and as hell\nAnd so I have a very deep respect for law enforcement and if you look at my record I worked hard to maintain a focus on public safety and has helped get good done\nBut I also understand that there's a higher responsibility on our law enforcement that hasn't been met in some places\nAnd people are worried that is why my criminal justice reform plan includes community safety as part of that conversation we've got to reconnect our communities to law enforcement and they have to be held accountable that's why I worked with rich go like the Republican chairman\nOf the judiciary non civil committee to pass legislation that actually held for law enforcement to a higher standard they were no longer allowed to access\nThe grand jury process without impunity and they had been previously and I'd want to continue to do that work I Want to continue the work that I'm governor deal began with post training that training that all of our law enforcement has to go through\nThat training has to include sensitivity training but also include diversity training and it can't be a one shot deal it's gotta be repetitive\nAnd there has to be consequences civil civilian review board I think makes sense but it's a local issue because most of these are locally held\nBeen to a hundred and fifty nine counties and I started traveling to those counties is the Democratic leader because I knew that I couldn't lead my caucus numbers without understanding communities they were part of\nI of my own volition gotten my own car and drove myself around the state to meet those hooked in to talk about their needs and this campaign I have grounded our campaign and issues and values and talking to every Jordan I can find\nAnd because of that I'm One Seventy six percent of the primary hundred and fifty three counties is thirty eight thousand donors to my campaign at least five times the number of individual donors from Georgia the my opponent has and I am very proud of each and every one of those donations because those are individuals who heard my message here in Georgia and believe that this is the right way to go\nI talk about Georgia across the country because Georgia's a national state we want to be a national leader\nThe current governor ... being the number one place to do business no one's coming here if they don't know about us and I'm going to do the best job I can to to shout about how great Georgia is across the country I've met with studio heads and California and New York because we bring their jobs here a hundred thousand film jobs my question is why hasn't brand kept taking the lead and talking to this\nI met with studio heads and California and New York because we bring their jobs here a hundred thousand film jobs my question is why hasn't brand kept taking the lead and talking to the sub so we can get a hundred thousand more here I talked to investors about bringing jobs to Georgia my question is why isn't brand kept doing the same thing\nI Believe that leadership comes from how you behave not when you have the job but what you're willing to do to get the job and I'm willing to go across the country\nCheerleading about Georgia to make certain that not only that I went but that George is the number one state in the country the dad become a last question what is your message take you these next two weeks to minority rural Georgia of women or minority women yes\n[laughter] I said\nJust a just a real softball or what are your days like how much sleep are you doing\nAbout four hours a night and I we we this morning I think I started at six am a will be going until late tonight or I may find myself on another national show talking about issues here in Georgia which one should we be looking at I don't know I I just work here [laughter]\nMy point is that is I I I I Love Georgia\nI was raised in Mississippi but I grew up here I came here when I was in high school and I chose to make George my home I spent the last Twenty years working for Georgia\nI spent the last Twenty years building a life here making certain that I was hiring Georgians creating jobs for Jordan's but also doing the work of serving Georgia and I think the values I bring face and family and service and um responsibility that those are Georgia values and that's why I'm asking every Jordan to consider me and to give me their\nVotes human lives so I think we just heard a closing argument that we may hear more young ones between now and November ... thank you so much for joining us how you will enjoy having you are in for way out for us what you'd like to do for the state would rather marriage at the questions\nWere to take a a very quick break and when we come back in Germany will stay with me or we're going to talk a little bit about\nThe other news in politics right now this is political reward ... who\nAre you thinking of getting rid of your old car truck van or RV and you see these legal donation programs here to help

[noise]\nThan yes she is fluent in squirrel monkey it's all on science friday from WNYC studio this afternoon at three on CPB and CPB news dot org [noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to political rewind or I'm joined for the last segment a show by Lisa Randall who's covered the legislature for Georgia Public broadcasting for the last what two three years to say I shouldn't have to lie and my Monday in front of your partner on the show Jim Galloway a V. AJC uh\nStacey Abrams Jim are you and I especially in at least a yo weigh in on this as well we've seen a lot of candidates for governor come and go and again I ... I asked me to repeat it again yes Brian campus been invited to do the show and you know what I Hope he's still says yes I'll come in but so far they haven't\nThought she really has her message down pat\n[laughter] she has her message down pat at times ... ... if ... if I'm putting on a campaign managers hats I'm I'm Wondering whether she would be better off simplifying some of that message she's I mean she gets she gets she's such a policy won't get since ... so deeply into the weeds\nThat that that sometimes the the the impact of the message is is is lost a medical landed\nOn their Web sites and then he pulled out of their their campaign paid they didn't even think that's a really intense and in third world America the Medicaid expansion\nIs is ... is one of those issues or it's it's a it's a very complicated issue and you're trying to break through a ... someone's view on on on those low income people on on geography a you know and maybe maybe to simplify that message to just simply saved my hospital\n... I don't think ... even as a legislator was very very thorough no matter what she tackled 'cause that's that's who she is that there is she\nRight um well it was good to have er here are talking about her or the issues that battered\n... that's ... that's right\nUm well it was good to have her here are talking about her ah the issues that battered her Jim let's go back a because you you went through the numbers pretty quickly but you did have an important poll yesterday you in a W S P TV conducted by the University of Georgia right\nThings sample size twelve hundred plus yeah that's a big deal a margin\nOf error is down to two point eight which allows you to to to dip into a lot of sub groups and ... so I knew\nThat there isn't that the margin of error there I made really our neck and neck there it's\nAll it's a we've got some forty eight forty six and a two point eight margin of error or a ... has released his statistically meaningless ... here\nYou you wrote a column which is what I really want to drill down on for a few minutes thought on I I you suddenly you ask Stacey Abrams about but I I'd ask you to go back and kind of talk to us about it again your most recent column is about the women at how the women were pulled in\nTo visit or service this isn't Sunday's paper here\nAnd and if you look at it it's it's there are there are plenty of of numbers there that if you're Stacey Abrams you're you're you're encouraged a if you Brian Kemp you're encouraged\nBut on the on the Abrams side if you look at the the gender breakdown of support for Abrams fifty point four percent uh this is a this is a ticket with two women at the top she's running with a ... Amigo\nOr she is a we've got two female candidates are running a Democrats running for PFC against Republican incumbents you have two female candidates running for the sixth and seventh congressional district as Democrats\nAnd and that's not that's that's not a comfortable margin or for Democrats I don't think fifty point for as it carries down the ticket\nIf you isolate what I did was I asked her our number crunchers just to isolate out a white female ... in this\nAnd the results were studying a number one uh you know just what ten days after the Kavanaugh uh the the Kavanaugh hearing couldn't concluded of Trump's support among white with white women in Georgia is ten sixty four percent of them yeah it's a and that book if you're if you're Brian Kemp\nYour aim is to be just a ... is is is to be three or four points more likeable than Donald Trump at this point it's that's that's a fairly comfortable\nThis is is to be three or four points more likeable than Donald Trump at this point and that's that's that's a fairly comfortable bar you know\nI'm you know they said it what's interesting particularly about these numbers that Jim is a pointed out is I assume\nThat some of these women are those suburban women voters that both campaigns really are targeting thinking that they're the independents who could flip either way so uh uh these are voters in many cases that that ... really needs to win over\nAnd I think that's now why she's going to focus on the female vote in the rural areas I think that's why they're so instrumental in this campaign because women make or break cantankerous we've known that for years now\nI think her plus you know she kind of shied away from it but I think her push really in these next few weeks are really getting onto the rural areas and really tackling those women who made in the rural area\nMight disagree slightly I think you're going to see her ... ... ... a little bit more attention to to suburban Atlanta\nSix and seven and district maybe up there ah Lucy McBride and Carolyn Bordeaux territory where there are a whole lot of people who are very well might be truly independent\nWomen right right and and and again this is and this is where I Want to keep going back to the health care issue Medicaid expansion\nIs because if it is it's it seems to me that if you're going to make a\n... a a rational argument for for white women to vote for Stacey Abrams and and we know as we know in the season that politics isn't always the rational thing but if it if it is if you're making that rational argument healthcare seems to be the place to start yeah\nBy the way I said I was in ... ... no that's her name I just had a moment to where I didn't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "12"}
