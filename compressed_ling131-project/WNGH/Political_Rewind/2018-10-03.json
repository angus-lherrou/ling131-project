grateful to you for\nSending your contributions thank you so very much for doing that\nPatricia Murphy you wrote a roll call piece that I saw for the first time a yesterday\nAnd here's the lead of all the questions left on day answered after the Judiciary Committee hearings for Brett Kavanaugh ended last week the hardest one to know for sure might be also be the most important for the long term health of the country\nCan this be saved after everything that happened last week and you're going to write a very balanced these Democrats and Republicans what do you mean by that\nWatching the Kavanaugh hearings on fall it got so personal not just between the nominee and the southerners up between the senators themselves and I think there is the man when Senator Graham looked across the hearing room\nBeing the nominee and the senators but between the senators themselves and I think there is the ... when Senator Graham looked across the hearing room and said that you know something to the extent of\nYou only want power and talking to Democrats you never had any intention of doing of doing this properly this is all your fault you have ... that I've never seen before and he just went he was it was\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nJust for a second but you've got to remember that we all base our attitudes of ideas on life experiences and I think the fact that Lindsey Graham never has been married has no wife or or daughters might might affect twos attitude but at the same time\nThis is a place that ought to be a photo of stability and has been over the years and I'm confident enough to think that once this little explosion happens a business will go back as usual and the Senate will be able to get his business doing what caused the Senate has to operate and get all of our country to operate\nYou sweat you way you know this\nIs my congressman when I Lived in South Carolina I've always admired him quite a lot and found it would be very reasonable and I've had several conversations with him um that was uncharacteristic 'cause the Lindsey Graham I had known 'em and I was\nBut a lot and found to be very reasonable and I've had several conversations with them um that was uncharacteristic 'cause the Lindsey Graham I had known 'em and I was sad to see it because it was a moment when it was not the Senate at its best and I'm afraid that the Senate's norms of ... and\nDeference have eroded quite a lot and it began um while back and I think that one of the problems is\nNot having confirmation hearings and not just for the last couple of Supreme Court justices but going back to judges that were being appointed in the Clinton Administration when you don't have confirmation hearings you begin to set up um or confirmation votes you begin to set up animosity between each side and there are a lot of grudges\nUm that have been around for a while and I'm afraid the current climate is just bringing them all to the forefront\nPatricia you also point out that when Kavanaugh was being questioned by Democrats um among other things at one point we became a rather famous or a piece clip\nAmy call before I was talking to him about his so did he ever drink socially blacked out and he shot back set back at her I don't know did you ever drink to your blacked out and you point out there in the old days it wouldn't have something else would have happened is that moment\nYou would've herd of cattle and the chairman would have said\nAh I just have to add right now this is not the way that we we would expect a witness to address senator um there is just the level of decorum in ... in the room that is typically\nExpected and would be much missed I think if this is permanent because these people work together every day and there are so many levels of that\nUm where you have to build trust and when somebody a ... attack and it's not responded to by anybody else on the committee I was actually shocked that it didn't um but I Do also point out in my piece\nThat this this was I think a long time coming and Democrats and Republicans absolutely bare equal weight for how we got here\nI like a buddy jump in I Want to point out that this is not anything new when I was working for Richard be rough for years and years ago a Ralph Yarborough from Texas tried to pull Strom Thurmond into a\nCommittee hearing room because I needed him to make a call from\nSean thermal resisted and they got into a wrestling match owned out in the hall outside of the committee room and Strom Thurmond pinned him or what I Try as this goes up and down right now of course we'll to NATO or but things will get better and I think the Senate will [noise]\nIm trying as\nThis goes up and down right now of course we oughta Nader but things will get better and I think the Senate will go to another another area of comedy and it goes up and down look out for the Senate to do any business any buys benefit is got to work and they would make it\nMore criticism that exactly what we're seeing in polling are all over the place that the that voters that Americans don't any longer believe that Congress does work that they are capable of doing anything it is a peculiar\nTime right now and I'm hoping that we will as buddies I'd go back to\nSort of a normal time yeah there's a time we go back to the civil war when\nOne congressman gained another senator so it's we haven't had that\nBut um we are at a point where we are dismantling norms that are troubling to me one of the things that I just mentioned that I watched the hearing I didn't see all of the morning but I saw all the afternoon and I thought that moment with senator club which are was unique in the sense that I thought senator club which are actually handled herself\nIncredibly well in that moment and retain dignity in a moment which wasn't necessarily the most dignified moments\nIn the Senate but I I think there were some Democrats that did not do very good job of maintaining that dignity\nOwn it's what Patricia said that's plenty of blame to go around on both sides I don't think there's any\nQuestion about this but the one problem do that kind of came out that ... wish for his sake could happen because I've ... I've got Calvin off fatigue but the one thing that uh our disappointed about is that if you're going to be a judge you got to show a certain temperament\nAnd you've got to show a shirt and restraint and he lost it\nAll right I I I got a degree I Am glad to say that I Want to get to another pledge break because I don't want to litigate Kavanaugh's confirmation show if you make a point right now we're rich with yours [laughter]\nAs political remind listeners supported CPB where we have civil conversations about politics and they'll try to litigate things just are not in the room just with Bill and his committee public radio works because of listeners who value programs like political rewind do their part to keep them on the air\nAnd time is running out on our fault ... and we're working on a goal of wrapping up this tried successfully with your support\nIn just two minutes you can make a big difference in the program do you expect to enjoy and help us get that much closer to the end of the drive with program costs on the rise your support right now is a special\nBig difference in the program do you expect and enjoy and help us get that much closer to the end of the drive with program costs on the rise your support right now is especially important go to Jean ...
