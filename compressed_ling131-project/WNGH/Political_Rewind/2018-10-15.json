N. right next to you he's Garrett Republican\nBut back in front of our microphones heavier cities are great to be here and I'm loving the ...\nAs some people won't go through that process some people will be frightened away by that process uh it is so it is is a\nA ... or ... I got to take issue with you and you and you know you called the same manufactured of a issue and and you're right it is but it was something that that that that the Republican lawmakers made up in February of twenty Seventeen\nBecause it was a reaction to a federal a settlement that ... had entered into\nAnd nine days later they pass legislation to to undo that settlement\nThey absorb the manufactured crisis as she's she's trying to imply\nThat there's a ball out there which is not there and trying to keep people from voting who are otherwise eligible to vote\nAnd this law does provide the ride provision for it it's set up because partially because of ... own group\nWho he's canvassers submitted thousands upon thousands of fraudulent and a poorly filled out voter registration forms over the last three or four years some of that still under investigation for the reason why we have exact match\nIs to make sure that people aren't trying to ... ... only registered to vote and vote in the wrong precinct or the wrong county or a or here are either on documentary illegal and make sure that that's being done correctly we all should be for a transparent and open to get everybody to the polls and vote\nBut his manufacturers and again is using identity politics where she's trying to do here is put fear into people of color that there's some group out there there's going to try to prevent them from coming at the polls and they become justify a you know rectify that situation when when it's been decades in the state of Georgia and they were much more further along and that and nobody's\nTrying to do list actually my girlfriend and I always thought about the tribal pollen yeah that's what he's trying to do empire while they play and I think that play on both sides on your own age range around around the country and you're going to see this uh this kind of politics at play\nBut I think it'd be used to be careful not to say that she's ... you know for her organization\nAnd around the country and you're going to see this or this kind of politics at play but I think it'd be we should be careful not to say that she's ...\nYou know or her organization did anything fraudulent I think if if there's an investigation that's fine if it was some stuff that was done that was sloppy has got to be corrected obviously but here's the thing about suppression which I think you know probably everyone at this table with would not necessarily identify with\nBut he was even notice in the mail that says Eli you don't have you may not be able to vote\nOr unless you do X Y and Z the fact that you get a notice it says that that is in in and of itself or the first step of suppression quite frankly because you're going to be thinking if you're not a regular voter or if you're someone who has historically seen your right to vote or your mother's right to vote on your grandmother's right to vote or taken away\nSomething is going to switch in your brain and you got to think well maybe I just\nMaybe I just don't need to fool with it and I think that's that play when you get a notice like that when I noticed it now to go you have to go to the pole to the precinct and handle all that when you're getting ready to vote with your licence and all that so why get a notice saying you know you can't vote or you may not be able to vote you'll find that once you get there\nI think it's fascinating ... that both of these issues the allegations of voter suppression which are you a ... campaign Stacey on our show in friday talked about it I'm\nA cat on the other side of this uh this thing we're talking about with um a a a Brian Kemp saying that say she was trying to get on documented to the polls\nThese are playing out his huge national stories the conservative media is really pick it up on the Stacey Abrams wants undocumented to vote on the liberal media I mean ... all over\nA national media you're seeing these stories pop up about Georgia has a a state that is actively trying to suppress votes I\nPlaying out of the national playing right now right and it's just simply not trail end it if you have registered and your ID doesn't match the name what's on the form you can sell no on the day in the ... so this is kind of a famed issue [noise]\nBut you know what I I I'm what I'm seeing is on on both sides and in and he would invite you to jump in here too I I see both candidates kind of adapting to the decline of a state wide media in Georgia right now in in the early right in that you know I mean the age of ...\nIt's kind of adapting to the decline of a state wide media in Georgia right in the early right in that you know I mean the AJC is is doing his very best but it doesn't have as many bodies as as it used to to throw at a at a at a gubernatorial campaign or the same is certainly\nTrue for for every other news paper and and and most most TV stations and you've got you've got Stacey Abrams who on Sunday when to meet the press went to CNN\nOr of course when we've already mentioned brand chemical into Fox and friends all to reach their people via cable news hadn't\nFox and friends on Sunday certainly didn't have Stacey Abrams on but they did do a story\nAbout a Stacey Abrams encouraging undocumented they played a little piece of this sounds that we shared with you that Steven follower got at the the rally or they played an edited version of it and they hit upon this theme that she's trying to encourage young documented the vote\nI think that's exactly right I think this is still those three things a gym and and I think number one and does this is a nationalized election around the country and folks\nThat because the house of representatives because they're stored nature of Stacey Abrams because the balance of power in because of the Trump effect both pro and con voters I think that that's why we get national coverage do you think the lack of of full body journalists at the local newspapers starting with AJC all the way down\nCovering state wide politics is a big deal when I Do think look in my my call about this is\nWe we talk a lot on this show and others about when Republicans or or or potentially using rhetoric that kind of divides the country as well and point out I agree it's both sides I Wish candidates both Republican and Democrats we stopped doing is we don't need young African Americans are young Hispanic of\nIndividuals' thinking that it's still Nineteen sixty Georgia because it's not\nIt's a completely different so any time very sensitive to anything that comes across trying to divide in that regard just like I think we've got to be careful when we talk about uh not letting undocumented a you know\nFolks vote we need to make sure they know their welcome in our in our state and then they have a role in our society economy but there is a line you've got to become legal in order to vote and it was kind of things but ... got to be really careful here because seizure and I want to live in a world thirty forty years from now in Georgia where we're not still debating this right where the first part of opposed desegregation generation\nRight that I think and make things better but we're still talking like we're living in the sixties when we're living in two thousand and eighty\nRight where the first part of opposed desegregation generation right that I think it make things better but we're still talking like we're living in the sixties when we're living in two thousand and Eighteen and things aren't perfect we got a long way to go but our politicians got to be more responsible about this bone both sides in my opinion\nWell you know one thing I you know and and I agree with you and everything and he said but if our Brian Kemp actually would probably be encouraging people to vote in really talking about uh the work that his officers done over the years in terms of providing greater access to the\nThey do have we've talked about the show during re have done a good job in finding ways mobile registration that sort of thing the D. S. registration so it's interesting what you're saying the answer\nI Would be I Would ... maybe his advisers are telling him if he starts really encouraging every Georgia and to go out and vote that it it may sound a little bit and progressive but I think that's that's something he should really be held or ... or ...\nAnd I think ... I I don't hear him saying don't go and do right I hear that from his campaign ... what would it really is interesting here is that he he is allowing folks too loud and he is doing his job\nAnd you all have manufactured initiated that isn't true and so he's having to combat that\nYeah the way I think the way he can would accept the I've heard a commercial or if it wasn't done directly by him where he talks about voting but I think he should really lean in on encouraging people developed any kind of get off with a defensive on the ... I think they're\nOkay I hear all this and I wonder if in some ways Republicans are not reaping what face so\nRepublicans over the past decade here and across the country\nHave looked at ways to make it harder and harder to go to the polls and vote no they claim\nThat because they want to stop voter fraud\nBut photo ID for instance hugely controversial when it first came on the scene a number of years ago why do I have to have a driver's license to show up and vote doesn't that disadvantage people who don't have driver's license is built they tend to be a minority of potential voters so in some ways\nRepublicans may think they're doing this for ballot security but it does lead to a place for Democrats can challenge them on music if we've got we've got two two lawyers here at the table\nBut it does lead to a place for Democrats can challenge them on\nMusic if we've got we've got two two lawyers here at the table here and okay was it ... Edmund Burke who said better that the ten men go free than one one of one man be can convicted unjustly\nWell we've got a flip of the last ... here we've got we we've got we've got Republicans accepting of a a certain amount of collateral damage in order to make sure that no improper ... boat is cast\nAnd and I I think that that's a that's a that's an interesting turn of philosophy that that that that you can you can question fifty three thousand\nRegistered people who want to register to vote in order to keep in elections secure in you know I think\nVoter yeah and I would think Jordan if you've got especially if you've got down ballot candidates were who are not getting a tremendous amount of certainly not getting a lot of free media attention the challenge of how you position them to be a recognized too early voters must really be something\nI I bet early voters who are coming out this early on in the game have already kind of decided way before you know who they're going to vote for so\nWe we do like he was saying we do tend to advertise maybe a month or two out to account for it but I don't think it's a big strategic decisions when I'm creating these campaign\nManager if I could add a non partisan message as if you want those robocalls to stop\nVote early [laughter] you know I never get any robocalls I feel kind of a long\nLine\nThe oh that's right I don't use all and I don't yeah All right during the election time our land line which we really don't use them as much as just ringing off the hook but one last thing I'll say about early voting the other thing is and I haven't thought a lot about this uh but\nYou know as the numbers start to be revealed and kind of who's voting and how they're\nVoting the other thing is and I haven't thought a lot about this uh but\nYou know as the numbers start to be revealed and kind of who's voting and how they're voting during this period that ended up itself that data Internet itself becomes a campaign issue right landmine or a wave to ride and I think that's something that they can and you're\nGetting your getting real time feedback that can help inform how you plan out the final couple of weeks of your campaign that's really interesting All right\nUh you know what we have such a great staff or us questions about the demographics in the counties that have extended voter registration Tom Foust this guy that forest\nWe already said Randolph county of course is is predominantly African American which is one of the reasons when they were looking or closing some polling places a there was some alarm that it was an attempt to suppress the African American votes so turn out to eat\nOr the ethnic composition is it's fifty five percent white thirty eight percent black four percent are Hispanic Grady county is fifty nine percent white\n... I'm twenty eight percent black ten or eleven percent basically Hispanic clay county is a sixty two percent African American or thirty percent or twenty nine percent\nWhite in like five percent Hispanic so it's a mixed bag down there do you have him ... minutes it's it's a\nUh I'd like to my my next next number that I'm I'm probably going to crunch when I leave here is I'm trying to find them figure out how many registered voters are there and what percentage of the the statewide elected by the counties where they were really but you know what I'm just because voting but a registration was extended in those counties\nAlone doesn't mean that we're not dealing with other\n... areas of the state's southwest Georgia oh no no you're also affected enormously such a wide swath right from Bainbridge to make and rewrite right a lot of folks still without power right absolutely All right I'm\nPresident Trump by the way we say the very beginning of the show he heads down here you're supposed to land I think around six o'clock this evening at Warner robins air force base case\nI think David Perdue is scheduled to be with him at and a lot of your truck is coming to your ... your closest to a good friend and a ... a political leader you worked with closely Johnny Isaacson not going to be there today that he's not going to be there today because uh\nOh it's just a good friend and a ... a political leader you worked with closely ... not going to be there today\nThat he's not going to be there today because of a conflict but he is going to be traveling tomorrow to south Georgia and it's a tour of the damage with the governor and a as a potential with the vice president of the United states so\nYou kind of ... let's break that news have the vice president's coming to the president's here today and you tell us the vice president isn't are\nKind of I'm hearing from our sources the vice president probably going to be here tomorrow so I don't know if I'm breaking news or not a [noise] um it's out there and I do think that there'll be there'll be looking at other locations where the president didn't get to today um\nAnd you know look at it and I'm from South Georgia I grew up in Albany so ah you know my heart and prayers go out all my family and friends down that way\nA significant damage the national media for whatever reason it has been covering this storm the way they've covered the previous storms but with the kind of magnitude and the power this format and the damage that it did a lot of us in rural communities and I know people were feeling forgotten and I'm Glad to see the president going and hopefully the vice president governor deal\nAnd Governor Scott are doing a tremendous job would their Jima and with the Florida emergency management but they these folks bringing attention to it are important to getting the resources there to help fix it\nOr the governor will I did we already say the governor of eminent be down there yet most days I um [noise]\nAs long as we're talking gubernatorial uh and and the fact that the president vice president at are going to look at hurricane damage I'm Jim Brian Kemp was down that way on Saturday he flew in and looked at damage in a number of\nCommunities that have been hard hit by this storm um\nAnd you know it it's it's silly and naive to say gee is there a political motivation behind a storm like that because it's silly because of course there is you cannot separate politics from the reality of what\nNot look natural disasters and the rise and fall of ... has been happening for for thousands and thousands of years and this is why everybody was worried about the the the impact of Puerto Rico on on on the Trump Administration right and this is Katrina and Bush back in in what two thousand four\nAnd that was that was that was a tremendous turning point it it is not ... to ... point is you know it's it's knowing that somebody out there is looking after you and looking out for you and if you if you if people don't have that that the the point of view\nBoeing that somebody out there is looking after you and looking out for you and if you if you if people don't have that that the the point of view of it then then then they're not there do you are not one of them and we should also mention the Stacey Abrams has a bus tour down in that the rise right\nShe starts in ... started and make it and I believe today and his heading down that same a direction um\nOkay so speaking of a weekend visit er visits by ah activities by the gubernatorial candidates Jordan Stacey Abrams this weekend became the first major a gubernatorial candidate I mean first companies right handed in a major party\nTo ride in the uh a gay pride parade\nThrough midtown Atlanta uh what's your take on her having that breaks or\n[noise] I I think it's it's neat and she's definitely appealing to to her base in this situation and then can you know she took the opportunity and and I I don't think there was any issue with that Cesar\nI Wonder I mean clearly that's the sort of things that will end deer her to the gay and lesbian community\nWhich is a pretty powerful voting bloc an even better financial block you really you know it was a guy who ran for mayor of Atlanta how powerful it can be make appeals to the algae B. T. Q. community right both for their votes and fundraising\nIs it well two things about that number one\nI was really surprised that that may news ah and I guess part of me I'm I'm In the bubble I think\nI mean my time in office I mean you it was you went to the gay pride\nParade you did that you've participated at your is your land and as I edited into Vlad are the candidate that elected official in the city of Atlanta major corporations are very involved I mean there's a huge employee kind of thing it's amazing and the energy to our surprise it that was new that I Would not have thought about that number will the number two what I also\nNoticed and ... and ... you know I'm not sure how this plays out how it gets played out\nBut you you see that there's just a position between facing the pride parade and camp as it was reported you know is check it out south Georgia in terms of what happened with the with the hurricane that's how that's being played a little bit and that's really interesting to see see that and\nYou know it's it's it's really interesting here okay we have Jordan who's a Republican correct correct okay and she is basically what she thinks it was neat that those rooms walked in the gay pride", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Political Rewind", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "15"}
