I have to think that are undecided rating is a little artificially low um\nIt doesn't mean it's wrong it just means we kind of squeezed out people that don't care\nGiven I think the headline on this though has to be right now or the landmark poll confirms what you saw it and your first poll of the general election race this thing is a toss up for the time being at least\nRight and we were talking about the er again earlier um [noise] you just wonder when it might break you know because we've seen this before or it seems close but ah I think the polls are no kidding this is for real close unlike what happened in Alaska\nWhen it might break you know because we've seen this before or it seems close but ah I think the polls during the kidding this is for real close unlike what happened in the last gubernatorial race when it was close enough that it was close and then it wasn't\nA throw in one piece of information on us so we were doing polling at the time for W. S. B. two thousand fourteen I have to give them the shot up and I'm In that race at this particular point Jason Carter still barely led the race he was within a very just as a a very small fraction but he was actually leading the race against governor deal\nOn October ninth we polled again and that's the point where governor deal tied Carter and then from there forward\nLed the race that this has changed this it's changed this year but I think the Kavanaugh hearings have identified all over again for everyone how partisan a lot of politics has ended his push to people earlier than normal to pick a team so to speak and I think there is a\nTremendous kickback we talked a little before the show started with this I think is becoming a real kick back\nAgainst Democrats I think they're they're overreaching now when they're starting to look at your books and comments people wrote in your books and ice being thrown forty years ago in a bar I mean it's ... it's too much and I think it's starting to hurt Democrats and is what you're seeing that in Georgia now\nIt last point bill I'm In two thousand fourteen at this exact same point it was October seventh two thousand fourteen we were in the field with a poll and I'm just looking at this now the libertarian in that year had five percent of the vote this year it's only two\nPercent of the shows you a lot about the partisan jabs between Republicans in Congress under what's your take on what you just heard from mark\n... let me look at the at sign from last year and then looking at those class has one of the things that got me when I look I look at polls for another station\nWould be the variability in terms of who was being sampled and the polls they'll oftentimes and pulls where Carter was dealing better their tended to be more African American respondents I'm In the new we're getting more Democrats kind of into the mix at the end of the day based on the exit polling that thing that that hurt Carter and the thing that hurt\nI'm Michelle Nunn really was on the under performance among white voters and so I think it's a question as sort of what's the combination of race and party\nSo I think that this time around ... we were to Jordan told us yesterday twenty five percent of the white votes are say they're going to\nA a Abrams venue weighed African American vote a third one and a half percent were waving them at twenty nine in two thousand fourteen which almost was dead on by the way right so what does it mean to you on\nAmerican voted a third one and a half percent were waiting I'm twenty nine in two thousand fourteen which almost was dead on by the way right so what does it mean to you on drugs\nI mean it's not surprising that mark would wait African Americans up because of the fact that this is a historic first candidate ... then you know there's likely going to be some greater interest among African American voters if that turned out to be wrong then and Abrams wood paneled would be a little further behind\n'em on this depending on what the weights look like\nAnd I think the other sort of big sort of question is what the white Democrats deal I'm In this particular race and that was that was actually really really hard to sample I'm sampling you know as as much art as it is science into that it's nobody's fault but it's just a question of trying to understand why\nI'm you know if the numbers don't turn out the way that we anticipate if African Americans turnout at thirty one percent in this race where does that stand historically\nIt's not enough she needs thirty to at least thirty two to realistically have average Americans ever turned out at thirty two percent gubernatorial race and journal and in fact Obama was thirty two thousand and two thousand and eight of the state has grown\nThe electorate is grown larger African American population it's there isn't a radical voting behavior they're not voting and solid numbers yet\nBut um they they are going to need to get that to probably thirty two percent\nIn order when I think I mean and what I Would argue is that it's not just blacks cell I mean there's no way Stacey Abrams wins this race just getting African American vote it's a question of what do other folks just to put a multi racial coalition together and said what most people are are also looking at is you've got to have robust turnout among blacks but she also can't do terribly among white voters\nTo write but before we do that's a great point you have her winning twenty five percent of the white vote or what does she probably needed if she's going to win the election it's got to be above twenty five percent\nRight out to be maybe a little bit more but not a whole lot more obviously if if the African American population dropped back in voting she has to do better with white voters\nIt suggests isn't this poll at least the or the white voters oh she's doing okay with them she's just got to pump up the rest of the voting population that is to\nThe next segment I guess you're going to ...\n... yeah we got to get to a break or we will talk about the absentee ballots that are coming in already uh we'll do all that right after uh

to us from savannah rights\nDoesn't bother you know I'll be honest it doesn't bother me as much as ... and you know it's a it's a public area that the question will be you know it's a it's an unusual circumstance considering the history United States with airports airlines\nSo that that could have been a little bit intimidating but I think Facebook Live and handheld cameras are\nGoing to result in all of us in public life for more really of all of you are having a a a more and more you know aggressive aggressive behavior to get on camera or is this is this just the grass roots people speaking\nOut I call a grassroots lobbying yeah and I think part of the reason why people feel that they have to resort to that is that I mean there may be a certain sense of desperation they feel that this is the only way that they're going to be heard\nUm you know for elected officials were put in a situation um you know I'm not terribly comfortable with a costing people at dinner renting them out of ... the other hand people are um\nMeet these people when they put themselves into positions of leadership they also give up a measure of their privacy and they're supposed to be in dialogue with constituents on a regular basis and to have somebody you know feels that you know trying to get a meeting with the with a kind of work or like you would know what my email or my tweet than the only way that I can\nIn dialogue with constituents on a regular basis and to have somebody you know feels that you know trying to get a meeting with you isn't gonna work or like you would not my email or my tweet than the only way that I can get your attention has to walk up to you in public and that's fine I mean you know another sort of more crass\nAnd says I'm you know sort of dimension famous people deal with stuff all the time where people walk up to them and ask them to find weird stuff and do all these kinds of things so I mean if you want to be in a position of leadership you should expect that people are going to walk up to even tell you how to do your job on a pretty\nRegular Riley gets that all the time you didn't grow up to him asking them for a ...\nI mean he's a
