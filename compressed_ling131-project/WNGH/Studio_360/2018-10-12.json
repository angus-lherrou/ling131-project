thirty ... plays and counting and her latest one Bernhardt hamlet just opened in New York Her fourth place to be staged on Broadway\nThree three back welcome to studio ...\nThank you so this play is about the\nGreat actress of the second half and the nineteenth century in the early twentieth century or serve Bernhardt played by the remarkable incandescent Jennings here\nAnd the central stories about her insistence at the height of her career and Eighteen Ninety seven him yes that she wanted to play hamlet yes as a middle aged woman on the stage and everybody is skeptical of that idea and she wants to play rewritten to strip out the poetry\nAnd one of the I Am certainly at the bottom I Am and make it more like talk yeah and uh and focus more on I guess the action or yes she was somebody who is\nReally known to be as sort of electrifying active presence on stage\nAnd she wanted to play hamlet that way and she felt like the classical stance of the poetry stood in a way out of the action which in fact it does vague idea so horse spent\nA year working on this argument but I wasn't sure are watching the play that you bought her arguments because as she says it it gets last like port how dare you want to adapt Shakespeare in that way I sort of stand with Sarah and a lot of\nHer arguments she's quite a brilliant woman and a lot of the things that she argues not play I did sort of lift from her own writings um so you have written a according to my research uh twenty five ... players I've actually written thirty eight thirty I but it it's still even Carol ... back in time\nShakespeare were thirty seven I catch up um but that's one of the year\nBasically for your you know ... plus doesn't dozens of episodes for like twenty TV shows a couple of what you've created um bus movies plus novels so truly I don't know of any other writer of your stature who is more prolific so why is that\n[noise] well you know I don't know I Am very fascinated by writing a I mean truly fascinated by it in ways that not everyone is do you like doing it too late fence that that's actually the other you go I Do\nIt'll be fascinated by it in ways that not everyone is do you like doing it too late that's that\nAnd I was trained and I know what the job is and I was qualified and um yeah that's all I have to say about that I'm\nSo as if all your vast ... wasn't a impressive enough plays and movies and TV shows and books you also got a doctorate from Brandeis University a Nineteen\nEighty nine I went back to graduate school and got a PHD in Victorian literature and theater and now I'm really glad I did I you know I'm Glad to know the things I Know I'm Glad to have spent the time I spent studying Victorian melodrama staying Victorian theater studying Dickens you know\nThat was back before melodrama was used almost only productively as it is to\nYeah you know was the tone it was a very popular form of entertainment everybody went I became fascinated by the fact that it was a\nA culture of theatre goers you know that this theaters were huge and that also that it was a place that all classes came together to watch these plans and how was that ... a melodrama different from drama the score it was called melodrama because everything was musically scored almost all the way through\nAnd it was highly um expressionist African gesture all a there was a kind of depletion of psychology and language which is what people know when they look back or if they find these texts they think\nYou know it doesn't have a natural anticipated movie sort of be a movie or name where they were it was silent movies go silent existed and also I think you can actually draw the line straight from Victorian melodrama into silent movie and into German Expressionism and\nUh there's a kind of ethics size do a lot of the stories that I I find really powerful\nAnd it's very stories centric yeah and and your different stories or do you do feel like oh I have a ... I feel like an ship with this because I care about story and\nYou know well there's a lot of theater that's very story centric you know you'd for about ... you know I think there's a kind of contemporary\nThey care about story and you know well there's a lot of theater that's very story centric you know you were thinking about ... you know I think there's a kind of contemporary\nArt now move away from it which is there's no question I'm not interested in ... or fractional for or post modern and what's going on here and I don't find that satisfying sometimes I mean I go to see it and I think well okay\nUm I certainly am a big fan of back at you know the musicality and that deep heart\nAre are things that I respond to a so it's not like I Need a big story to be satisfied in the theater um but I Do believe that the action rises out of character and story rises interaction and that those are profound truth\nI'm In a great place are written on those troops or and or don't apologize for I'll go to my deathbed\nUm insisting but there are people who actually criticize your work for being too accessible well I find that mystifying do I do or is it just a general standard issues ... of the\nTwentieth century and now twenty first century well I think that it's a it sounds arrogant toward the audience named which seems contradictory around to form that can survive without an audience and I so I've always felt like I Do want to invite people in to the theater I deeply believe we should all be going to the theater or art\nOr the reason we back it has been a
