studio three sixty\nThank you so this play is about the\nGreat actress of the second half of the Nineteen century in the early ... century uh serve Bernhardt played by the remarkable incandescent Jennings here\nAnd the central stories about her insistence at the height of her career and Eighteen Ninety seven\n... that she wanted to play hamlet yes as a middle aged woman on the stage and everybody is skeptical of that idea and she wants to play rewritten to strip out\nThe poetry I Am certainly at the bottom I Am and make it more like talk yeah and uh and focus more on I guess the action\nOr yes she was somebody who is really known to be a sort of electrifying active presence on stage\nAnd she wanted to play hamlet that way and she felt like the classical dancer the poetry stood in a way out of the action which in fact it does I ... I just spent\nA year working on what makes this argument but I wasn't sure watching the play that you bought her argument because as she says it it gets last like how dare you want to adapt Shakespeare in that way I sort of stand with Sarah and a lot of\nHer arguments just quite a brilliant woman and a lot of the things that she argues not play I did sort of lift from her own writings um so you have written a according to my research uh twenty five ... players I've actually written thirty eight thirty I but it it's strange Carol ... now it's time\nShakespeare were thirty seven catch 'em but that's one of the year\nBasically for your you know ... plus doesn't dozens of episodes for like twenty TV shows a couple of what you've created um plus movies plus novels so truly I don't

you know I don't know I Am very fascinated by writing a I mean truly fascinated by it\nIn ways that not everyone is do you like doing it I Do\nAnd I was trained and I know what the job is and I was qualified and um yeah that's all I have to say about that I'm\nSo as if all your vast ... wasn't impressive enough plays and movies and TV shows and books you also got a doctorate from Brandeis University a Nineteen\nEighty nine I went back to graduate school and got a PHD in Victorian literature and theater and now I'm really glad I did I you know I'm Glad to know the things I Know I'm Glad to have spent the time I spent studying Victorian melodrama staying Victorian theater studying Dickens you know I mean that was before\nMelodrama was used almost only pejorative Lee as it is to\nYeah you know was the tone it was a very popular form of entertainment everybody went I became fascinated by the fact that it was a\nA culture of theatre goers you know that this theaters were huge and that also that it was a place that all classes came together to watch these plans and how was that ... a melodrama different from drama the score it was called melodrama because everything was musically scored almost all the way through\nAnd it was highly um expressionist African gesture all ah there was a kind of depletion of psychology and language which is what people know when they look back or if they find these tax they think\nYou know it doesn't have a natural anticipated movies so trying to be a movie or name where they were it was silent movies are silent existed and also I think you can actually draw a line straight from Victorian melodrama into silent movie and into German Expressionism and\nThere's a kind of ethics sized do a lot of the stories that I I find really\nAnd and it's very stories centric yes as a New York is very stories or do you do feel like oh I have a ...\nStories that I I find really powerful and and it's very stories ... yes yes and you're working for a story or do you do feel like oh I have a kid I feel like an ship with this because I care about story and you know well there's a lot of\nTheater that's very story centric you know you think about ... you know I think there's a kind of contemporary\nRight now move away from it which is there's no question I'm not interested in ... or fractional for or post modern and what's going on here and I don't find that satisfying sometimes I mean I go to see it and I think well okay\nUm I certainly am a big fan of back at you know the musicality and the deep heart\nAre are things that I respond to a so it's not like I Need a big story to be satisfied in the theater um but uh I Do believe that the action rises out of character and story rises interaction and that those are profound truth\nI'm In that great place I've written on those truth or and or don't apologize for I'll go to my deathbed um insisting\nBut there are people who actually criticize your work for being too accessible well I find that mystifying do I do or is it just a general standard issue snobbish this of the twentieth century and now twenty first century well I think that it's a it sounds arrogant\nToward the audience named which seems contradictory around a form that can survive without an audience and I so I've always felt like I Do want to invite people in to the theater I deeply\nBelieve we should all be going to the theater I\nTry to read and read back it has been a pleasure of not surprising by her but surprisingly pleasurable thank you thank you Teresa ... new play
