fresh air and congratulations on first man you\nKnow my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut and space\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] this is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross back with Damien ... he wrote and directed whiplash and love and and he directed the new film first man during Ryan Gosling is Neil Armstrong the astronaut who commanded the Apollo eleven the first man space craft to land on the moon\nOn July twentieth Nineteen sixty nine Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon\nAnd you mentioned you had the chance to talk with I'm Janet Armstrong who was Neil Armstrong's why if they were married for thirty six years and then I'm divorced what were some things you learn from her\nThat help you understand what she and she's portrayed by clear foie and what Armstrong we're going through during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nOr well one thing I think that Neal is Janet had in common was this ability to put on his face and in moments of incredible upheaval you know it was something in their characters\nAnd I think that Neal enchanted had in common was this ability to put on his face and in moments of incredible upheaval you know it was something in their character is sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had some you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to ... you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when uh you know you you're you're you're moving from place to place in ... to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot the ex Fifteen he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and and almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way but of course as complicated as that\nAnd uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities and instances of that we picked in a movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moment to the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a ... to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon mission sits down and tells them that he may not return\nThe made him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded in Jim Hansen's book I'm beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually was I mean\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from what she recollect and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process the movie wreck elected\nIn the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his hands saying I might not make it that she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yet you know and he has been in this incredible like low\nKey way without really really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through\nWhen a motion yeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know it is in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nI think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and actually sitting down and facing them and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep ... fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think is a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and what I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your way to the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nClooney version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just that the tracks\nAnd Im self it stumbled on a you mentioned a Jim ... book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks the music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from ... shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and loving in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and why\nWhy don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about when you were in a Rapid City\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nUm\n[noise]\n\nI'm a\n... which Neil Armstrong played on later known any ... in the new movie first man like his directed by ... lots of direct dead last\nWhich Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by my ... who also directed la la land and\nWord it too and also wrote and directed whiplash diminishes Oh thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on our shown congratulations on the regular so nice to be back first Robin Damien ... directed the new movie first man and won an Oscar for directing la la land in\nMy next guest is Adam Cohen the son of Leonard Cohen\nWhen Leonard Cohen died two years ago at the age of eighty two he left behind many unpublished writings some of his unpublished poems lyrics notebook injuries and drawings are collected in the new book the flame Adam Cohen wrote the forward\nAnd I'm also produced the album is father recorded shortly before his death called you want a darker\nAnd him as a singer and songwriter who's album like a man when gold in Canada and twenty twelve he was born in Montreal and Nineteen Seventy two and I'm going to talk with us about Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father in the final year of his life\n\n[noise] this is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross back with Adam Cohen a songwriter singer who's the son of Leonard Cohen Adam has written the forward to a new collection of his late father's previously unpublished lyrics poems notebook injuries and drawings it's called the flame\nAdam also produce the final album his father released before his death\nCalled you want it darker\nLeonard Cohen was very weak and in pain when he recorded it is their son you remember\nA from your childhood\nThat sticks in your mind a song that meant a lot of you maybe even a song you remember your father writing\nI mean when I was really young\nI remember him composing hallelujah you remember him writing it oh yeah and I remember him being your took um twelve years [laughter]\nYou know that started it started when I was very very young at here versus I think they're eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there was no one string guitar in his underwear and are there to always be versus to consult I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own album which by the way Sony at the time you didn't want to put out [noise]\nIsn't it amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity has has grown you know he lived in a kind of like comic anonymity if you\nBuy those to defeat by that unlikely union and um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to question for me to have\nSet on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to and to my forties [noise] um the whole canon of his work is\nLiving inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation yeah so\nFor hallelujah as you say there is that there were eighty four versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed because of dissatisfaction with a versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nAs the popular\nDissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nAs the popular a poem states of palm is never finished but rather abandoned [laughter]\nDo you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think I'm ... and that was expected um ... success of being able to let it go was who was the unexpected you know I think as I said was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew\nThe black and pages and then gave up an enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised enormous amount [noise] go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patients in my family my master piece on the side\nYou know you call it that you know some people subscribe to the to the last of the first thought that thought and that's often attributed to a one of the beat writers but your father believed last thought best thought [laughter] yeah he he edited the edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic\nIt was a constant process of filtration and refined for certain\nWhat why don't we hear hallelujah fathers version\nSure Leonard kind of they were\nGoing to have more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right to sleep transgression yet yeah refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something you know or give give some other songs a chance to get played um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] seven spite of the moratorium your family had an ... yeah I think I think I'll play it anyway are you okay with that oh God I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter] okay there it is\n\nReally\nReally for\n\nThat one or ... singing hallelujah and my guess is Leonard ... son Adam Cohen and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion mislead publish Leonard cone um lyrics poems\nNotebook injuries and drawings and it's called the flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people in the record it hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until just about the recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it\nAnd which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there was a period of years when your father is genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just ... a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him [noise]\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten [noise]\nYeah [laughter]\nFeel like my father probably felt like his whole life was characterized by that by that description that he did have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten but the but you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied\nOr he was a seeker\nWasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society she wasn't happy with society itself but we're ... ... deep in the conflict\nI'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people who have chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover [noise] um and through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction he somehow mustard\nI'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm one of the most delightful people anyone ever came across and it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you had this\nShabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more ... surprising and delicious you know this unexpected ability to have to fill the twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world these\nReviews from people that were like you know 'cause you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself I'm was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and\nTo see him take his hat off you know and I think the jubilant audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised and delighted\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life when\nI saw him probably in the late ... thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue that\nSense of like ... ... the devotion of its fans to him and his devotion to the music and see things
