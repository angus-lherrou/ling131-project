has become a full time job for each of them it's emotionally draining and it's straining their savings to\nIt's also become a source of friction in their relationship\nI think it's fair to say than in your movie you give pretty equal weight to how the husband and wife are experiencing\nTrying to conceive or to adopt and they they each have their own like emotional crises that they have to go through\nAnd I think it's interesting that you did that you didn't just try to do the woman's point of view and have the man be like totally comprehending and and cold and you know not going not going through his own issues\nYeah I Love I like I'm Glad you said that and I love Paul's portrait of I'm Richard her husband and I think when I set out to do it I remember thinking to myself oh this is a mutual midlife crisis\nThis is happening to both of them and in a way sometimes I think of it like a buddy movie and I did this with a Savage is too when you're writing some thing that's so character driven sometimes you need to create order in your brain because it's not a genre\nAnd I remember thinking with is that it was like a buddy movie and in stead of getting in a car and driving across the country would I don't know a bank heist or something they're getting in a car and driving through like infertility land was important to me that it was a mutual\nI don't know crisis that it wasn't

of adoption did you have to ask yourself what would it mean for a child to really feel like you're a child [noise]\nYeah um but then I think something kind of takes I mean there is this presumption as

which an unknown hacker was able to log onto the accounts of at least Fifteen million Facebook users but that's just one element of the crisis facing the world's largest social media

securities and Exchange Commission the Federal Trade commission and authorities in Europe and Australia\nOur guest New Yorker staff writer Evan Austin us explore space but history and profiles it's thirty four year old founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a recent issue of the magazine\nHe says ... relentless drive to expand Facebook's reach has jeopardized the privacy of its users and made it vulnerable to political manipulation\nHis story is titled go send the machine can Mark Zuckerberg fix Facebook before it breaks democracy he spoke with fresh air is Dave Davies\nWill ever knows those welcome back to a fresh air you know we all know Facebook is a very big deal give us a sense of its size and reach\nThere's really nothing quite like it in the history of American business uh it is now to point two billion monthly active users meaning it's larger than any country in the world it's really got no I'm no natural precedent when you look at the history of enterprise it's really closer in terms of scale and reach to\nA political ideology or religious faith I mean it just didn't literal terms it now has as many adherents a as Christianity and that is all been built in the last fourteen years since who was founded in\nTwo thousand for [laughter] for this piece you visited Mark Zuckerberg at his home ... at his office had numerous meetings a lot of access from a guy who was pretty careful about you know journalists to getting connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with him [noise] well he did it I should say ...\nUh you know journalists to getting a get connected to him how did you convince him to share so much time with him [noise]\nWell he did it I should say reluctantly um you know this was a long process that started a year ago when I first approached them about the idea of this kind of story I said look I I\nWe do in the New Yorker these very long detailed profiles and I think initially Facebook's view was we don't need to do this or a big powerful company [noise] um [noise]\nAnd I continue to work on it basically started interviewing a lot of other people around Facebook people who worked there in the past people who work there and the president\nAnd ah as that accumulated I continue to say look this fundamentally should be about how Mark Zuckerberg sees the world and over time they came to I think sort of grudgingly and I but I'm I'm grateful for it except the idea that [noise]\nTo an extraordinary degree mark soccer break is Facebook I mean that is the reality he's the chairman he's the c._e._o. he owns\nControls ... sixty percent of the voting share so if you're going to understand Facebook in any meaningful way the conversation really has to start with him and end with him and and for that I think they ultimately recognized [noise]\nHe had to be a part of this project [laughter]\nThe company has come up against a growing and really serious decline of public trust both among politicians and among the general public and [noise]\nI think they recognize that at the core of that and I think he recognizes that there is this profound question mark around what does Mark Zuckerberg believe and what does he stand for what does he care about how does he see his role in the country what does he see for the for the role of technology and\nThis project was my attempt to try to answer some of those questions for myself and for readers\n[noise] um ... started Facebook when he was a Harvard it takes off and it grows and grows because they're determined\nOf you know to to get more users to connect to poor people as ... likes to say and you write that in about two thousand seven a plateaued at about fifty million users which a lot of other kind of similar platforms had done what did the company due to break through that sailing [noise]\nWhen they first packed really there was a a a a sense internally that they wondered whether they'd sort of hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now over and and what they did was they just\nReally there was a a a a sense internally that they wondered whether they'd sort of hit the wall and whether this thing that had grown so fast was now over and and what they did was they discovered something important [noise]\nWhich is that in order to punch through that wall they have to come up with a whole range of new ways of accessing\nNew populations people who wouldn't otherwise had been on Facebook the first thing they did was they discovered they simply had to translate the site into other languages make it available to other countries around the world and allow people to be able to post in Spanish and so on\nAnd by doing that they cross the barrier that smoked which had prevented other social media sites from growing\nBut it did something even more important which was that it established\nThe sacred importance really sacred is the word of gross internally they created a a team called the growth team which became as of ... former Facebook executive said to me it was really cool crowd this was\nThe team everyone wanted to be on was ... it was about really sank defying the idea of growth as an end in itself that if Facebook stopped growing than its whole reason for being would cease to exist and that idea\nEnded up becoming the dominant fact of the next decade from two thousand seven until today when\nFacebook became a extraordinarily focused on whatever it could do to continue growing year after year\nAnd one of the things they did was that they made it a platform for outside developer so that may be able to explain what this means so that ups other software developers could pitch in to Facebook and use it [noise]\nThey made a big choice which was that instead of saying we're just going to be our own site we're actually going to try to become a platform like almost like an operating system the way that windows used to be the you know the way that everybody went on onto their personal computer and then you would build applications on top of that and that decision to open themselves up as a platform\nMeant that they were then sharing data to a much larger group of developers of programmers than they otherwise would end this turned out to be a fateful decision because if you fast forward many years later to and what we all now know as the Cambridge Analytica scandal that was\nThe was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they've done was they allowed an academic researcher to use some of the data on the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold back data to the political consultancy known as\nAllowed an academic research or to use some of the data on the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold back data to the political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which that data went out the door or has created much of the crisis that now engulfing the company\n[noise] today and you write that the executive within Facebook Sandy para kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know at developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users to you know plugged into their games what did he find\nWhat he found unnerved him a Sandy Park illicit joined Facebook at in twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out what the data that they were given to developers was being misused in any way or [noise]\nGet where people are violating privacy where they are taking more data than they were supposed to I found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nAre in other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm including for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this feeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit\nTo go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told a that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "07"}
