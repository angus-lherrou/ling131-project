Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bow jak horsemen\nA satire about Hollywood success or failure depression addiction and the human condition in general although many of the characters are not human they're tacking animals with human characteristics season five is currently on Netflix and season one is now being shown on Comedy Central\nSo you said that you regret some of the jokes from the first season and some of the ways bow jacks bad behavior like sleeping with his co stars I'm being drunk all the time ah being mean to people you just kind of regret turning some of those things and to jokes can you talk about that a little bit\nSure well I you know I think regret is maybe a strong word and I I don't know um what a better word would be like if you go with regret and it it's not necessarily that we had bow jak doing these things um because I think it is part of the character and I do think that we have\nFully investigated these actions and I think we've taken great pains to try not to glamorize who Bo jak is um but I I think I have a firmer understanding of the power of narrative and the power of humor I think in the in the context of the show we were making in the context of\nAnimated shows in general uh end up a time when the show came out and also just TV shows about\nLet's say bad dudes or you know dirt bags I think there is a a kind of joke where it feels like you're like holding someone to task but really you're playing it it's like kind of cute are funny\nAnd I don't know if we always landed on the right line of that but I think there are moments in season one or maybe it feels like we're not just letting him off the hook what kind of taking his perspective on things right so if he says a sexist thing or if he you know ...\nSeason one or maybe it feels like we're not just letting him off the hook but kind of taking his perspective on things right so if he says a sexist thing or if he you know dismisses somebody\nThe obvious joke is not oh he's a bore and he shouldn't be saying that it almost feels like we're saying oh isn't it it's kind of cool and funny that he's saying this even though we know we shouldn't be saying it like don't you kind of wish that you could say these things to you know what I mean and\nAnd that wasn't that wasn't intentional but I think it's slippery I think that happens sometimes without us meeting too\nAnd I think there are a lot of comedy writers and I I Would include myself on those who sometimes think we have a better handle on what we're saying than we actually do\nAnd there's a kind of comedy that I think you could call\nIronic sexism or post racism\nOr yes our character is saying this thing but we\nYou know the voice of the show don't agree with that and I think that distinction as maybe more slippery then people will allow themselves to believe I don't know if you have the control over that that you think you do about how that goes out into the world and how people internalize that humor um you know I I grew up uh in the era of South Park\nAnd I think South Park is a brilliant show and then there's so much that they do well and I there they've made me think about a lot of things in New ways um\nBut I they also have a lot of jokes about Jews and I remember being in middle school and high school and people like making jokes about me that they got from South park\nAnd obviously if you ask Matt in trade they would say well Carmen is not a role model if you're not supposed to think he's like cool or funny or charming\nBut I think middle school or high school me who is the butter those jokes would say well what's the difference you know what what does that mean to me and I think I Am also guilty of of of making jokes like that in the mouth of Bo jak or some of our other characters and not always\nThinking about what are the longer ramifications of this on our culture\nIs there an example you can give that child that you may be regret or wish you had placed differently in it can actually\nI can give a couple of examples you know I think a big one which I feel very comfortable talking about is a lot of the Jewish jokes we have had throughout the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes and I\nOut the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes and I think maybe I believed in season one and two that we were passed anti Semitism and I think now I look around the world and I think that was naive on my part and I think we are not\nAs passed it as I had convinced myself that we were and thought that we were and now some of those jokes in the early seasons just hit me a little differently um another joke about somebody that I Am not as we have a joke in season to 'em and bow jak is a very Boris character\nAnd we had a a gag or he's going on this press tour and everyone's worried that he's going to say something offensive and they're going to Alaska and he has a line about what we're going to Alaska what am I going to say that it's going to send a bunch of inbred Eskimo barber monsters is the line\nAnd you know on paper I can defend that joke and I can say no the joke of that is not on the Alaskans it's about how stupid bow jak as and now he doesn't realize including the way it's set up as oh he is saying this offensive thing\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross my guest is nominated for a National Book award for his memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction\nIt's a graphic memoir which is to say it's a book of text an illustration kind of like a comic geared to young adults but I'm an adult adult and I loved it\nJared J. ... was about to turn three when his grandparents insisted on taking legal custody of him because of his mother's heroin addiction and related problems that prevented her from taking care of him she was in and out of rehab with a student in prison while he was growing up\nThe book is written from the point of view of a Seventeen year old self looking back on his childhood and teenage years\nBecause I still wasn't an athletic boy in wasn't good at socializing so drawing was as refuge his way of making friends and his way of dealing with life\nBecause Africa is also known for his series of graphic novels for young people including lunch lady and the ... plus police squad series as well as our eggs in the star wars jet I academies series\nHe uses the middle initial J. Jared J. 'cause Oscar and his official author name as a tribute to his late grandfather who was named Joseph\n... ask a welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award Oh thank you so much Terry Gross [laughter] so did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents\nAre finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she was a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all this time no that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your families\nAnd Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I get older sometimes I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand and twelve that I share that story more widely\nPeople must have asked you like kids must have asked you all the time like how can the grandparents are raising humor as their parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories on my my father he he travels a lot for business or you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean maybe that my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nReally a mother lives in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nI didn't I didn't I didn't learn his first name until I was in sixth grade [noise]\nSo you've written about your childhood and your mother in the form of a graphic memoir for a young adult adult I'm an adult and I really liked it I I Would recommend Mr adults but um why did you want to like target AT T on ...\nWell you know I've made a career out of writing illustrating books for young people you know I picture books I I have graphic novels for for the middle grade reader and middle greatest seven to eleven years old [noise]\nAnd I knew I always wanted to share the story visually um based on the intensity of the subject matter and my grandmother salty language alone I knew this needed to be for an older audience um and I've always been obsessed with a coming of age stories about that moment in a person's life where they decide\nWho they want to be for the world is you know projects them out into the war on such a way this okay this is my path\nAnd for me that really was my senior year of high school so many things were happening I'm obviously one gets their license that's a that's a big game changer I met my father for the first time things came to head with my mother a and I was you know leaving the home\nThat I grew up in to pursue my dreams via our college\nUh so it seemed like a natural for me to tell that perspective from that Seventeen year old self the story is told the perspective of the the Seventeen year old ...\nIt seemed like a natural for me to tell that perspective from that Seventeen year old self\nThe story is told to their perspective of the the Seventeen year old Jared and you know it's funny I didn't really think of it as a quote unquote you know grown up book\nBut really are a lot of grown ups have been reading it and responding to it and identifying with it because you know addiction touches so so many of us are either directly or just we're just one degree away from it\nIt seems to be details about your mother that you felt were too upsetting to put in a book for young people\nI've been working on this book in one way or another since the early early to thousands and every time I Would sit down to write it\nI Would stop and hesitate because I Would I Would worry to myself well why aren't people kind of thing and at first it was what are the people in the book going to think you know if I'm writing about them and um\n[noise] and that was stopping hesitate and then as my career grew in I became known as the the lunch lady guy I have a series of graphic novels about a lunch lady who fights ... crime and it's camping it's funny and\nI thought wow is this is writing a book on the subject matter going to be in such contrast to that [noise] those happy books that I Would be putting my career on the line um by\nAs I've traveled the country and I met more and more and more young people who are dealing with this I realize that there's a sort of a responsibility for me to write this book I mean you know to go with a theme of comic books with with a great power comes great responsibility now I have an audience of these kids who grow up with my books\nAnd I feel like I owe it to these readers to to put myself out there and I realize that if I if I was going to write memoir I had just write it without any inhibition and I I wrote down the expression and I'll I'll censor this for the radio but I said right like you don't give an F.\nAnd and not that I don't care about the craft\nBut I Can't worry about negative opinions you know I have to just write this and put out there\nSo there are some things I learned about my mother later on in life um but I couldn't give some of that knowledge to that Seventeen year old protagonist because that would have really affected his relationship with his mother [laughter]\nAnd uh but there there is one particular scene or because I did have to explain how really how my mother fully went away you know what would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son and this is something I learned as an adult\nAnd fully went away you know what would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son\nAnd this is something I learned as an adult and I was able to find a way to share that and the story but not give that knowledge to the protagonist\nAnd when I was when I was a toddler she was in a very abusive relationship and her boyfriend at the time came home and he and his colleagues had a drug deal gone bad and they'd murdered somebody\nAnd ah my my mother help them clean up and dispose of the evidence and and that's a big reason why she went away\nYou're heading that would have been seen as a child\nWas upsetting to me as an adult him and I learned about it right before the birth of my first child and so I kind of you know what let me just mentally shelf that [laughter]\nIf I can focus on being a dad to the human being but I don't know how to take care of and then um some years later you know when I was really digging in researching this book I realize narrative Lee I have to explain to the readers fully why she's going the way for so long um [noise]\nYou know you don't go away that long for for shoplifting at the mall\nOr or for stealing batteries from a convenience store\nUm and I'll tell you like you might be the ... six or seven person I've ever so the outlaw how to Terry and I and I share that for those young readers out there who are dealing with heady issues at home so it took a long time for me to gain that courage to make this book\nNow I really understand why your grandparents insisted on getting legal custody view 'cause they were afraid he'd become a word of the state\nThat's exactly it that's exactly it and they were and they also are afraid I Would get hurt\nAnd what's interesting too is for it for\nYou know I have a daughter and she's she's nine she'll be ten soon ... and ... has been this sort of the forbidden fruit in our house I'm just really wanted to read it I was wondering about that yeah yeah and so you know imagine okay here here's your family history too you know child or [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "city": "Chatsworth",
