is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross ... he wrote and directed whiplash and Lala land\nAnd he directed the new film first men staring Ryan Gosling is Neil Armstrong the astronaut who commanded the Apollo eleven the first manned spacecraft to land on the moon twentieth Nineteen sixty nine Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon\nAnd you mentioned you had the chance to talk with\nI'm Janet Armstrong who was Neil Armstrong's why if they were married I think for thirty six years and then I'm divorced what were some things you learn from her\nThat help you understand what she and she's portrayed by clear foie and what Armstrong we're going through during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nAh well one thing I think that Neal a gene that had in common was this ability to put on his face and in moments of incredible upheaval you know it was something in their character's sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had it also ... you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture that uh\nSomething in their character as sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had that also you know it was very much a product of of of their time and their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when uh you know you you're you're you're moving from place to place in ... to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot the ex Fifteen he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and and almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with may just that it was as simple as that in a way but of course as complicated as that and uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities and instances of that we picked in a movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moments in the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film or a ... to her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon mission sits down and tells them that he may not return\nThe made him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded and Jim Hansen's book I'm a guinea to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually was I mean\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from what she recollection and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process the movie wreck elected\nIn the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his hands saying I might not make it that like she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yet to hear that\nAnd he has been in this incredible like low key way without really\nThat really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family I'm the only way you can get through\nYou know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know a ... in real life it to a certain extent with someone who\nI think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and are actually sitting down and facing them and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and flying into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep gnawing fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think it was a music he actually brought with him to play after the space finding my right about that\nThis is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah that and yet so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your ... to the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nAny version of what you know ruin or might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal\nThe thing about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracks the music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from ... shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nIn space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real can actually do except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm Bad actually found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nWhy don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] uh\n[noise]\n\n\nUh\nAtlanta

notebook injuries and drawings it's called the flame\nAdam also produced the final album as father released before his death\nCalled you want it darker\nLeonard Cohen was very weak and in pain when he recorded at their son you remember\nFrom your childhood\nThat sticks in your mind a song that meant a lot of you maybe even a song you remember your father writing\nI mean when I was really young\nI remember him composing hallelujah\nYou remember him writing it oh yeah and I remember him being here took um twelve years [laughter]\nSo you know started it started when I was very very young here versus I think they're eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there within one string guitar in his underwear and are there to always be versus to consult on that I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own album which by the way Sony at the time I didn't want to put out [noise]\nIsn't it amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity have have grown you know he lived in a kind of like comic anonymity if you\nBuy those too if you buy that unlikely union [noise] and um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to question for me to have that on the side of the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to and to my forties [noise]\nUm the whole canon of his work\nLiving inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation yeah so\nFor hallelujah as you say there's there were eighty four versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four bullets did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed because of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nAs the popular a poem states of palm is never finished would rather abandoned\nDo you think he was frustrated working on it for so long\nUm states of poem is never finished but rather abandoned [laughter]\nDo you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think um prescription expected um ... success of being able to let it go was who was the unexpected you know I think as I said was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew\nTo black and pages and then gave up an enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised enormous amount of go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patience and my family my master piece on signed\n[noise] you know you call it that you know some people subscribe to the to the philosophy first thought that thought and that's often attributed to a one of the beat writers but that your father believed last thought best thought [laughter] yeah he he edited I edited his sounds a lot he went through a lot of traffic\nIt was a constant process of filtration in refined for certain\nThat why why don't we hear hallelujah fathers version [noise]\nSure yeah\nGo ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family so how is that right you got to actually be transgression yup yeah refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI I think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something you know where they give give some other songs that chance to get played [noise] um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] seven spite of the moratorium your family has an hallelujah I think I think I'll play it anyway are you okay with that oh God I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter] okay I heard it\n\nReally\n\nThat ... singing hallelujah and my guest is Leonard ... son Adam Cohen and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion mislead published Leonard cone\nUm lyrics poems\nNotebook injuries and drawings and it's called the flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people have recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until just about the recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded it\nAnd which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father is genius west and fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him [noise]\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\n[noise]\nYeah [laughter]\nFeel like my father probably felt like his whole life was characterized by that by that description that he did have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was\nNot satisfied\nOr he was a seeker\nWasn't satisfied with either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society she wasn't happy with society itself but we're ...\n... deep in the conflict he wasn't a few wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him she wasn't satisfied with his role was the father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover\nHe wasn't satisfied with the people who have chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover [noise] um and through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard\nI'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm one of the most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like he had this\nShabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising and delicious you know this unexpected ability to have to fill the twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world these\nReviews from people that were like you know this is likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself I'm was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and uh [noise]\nTo see him take his hat off you know and sank we jubilant audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised and delighted\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late ... thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and see the same as
