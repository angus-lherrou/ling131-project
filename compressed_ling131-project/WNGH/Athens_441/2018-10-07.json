here's the latest from Peter ... and John McCain\nTeam at McCain blue around all the\n\nAnd\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nYeah I just realized that Peter ... at Johns initial stop PBS Jay ... let's say that all the time or it any case of that\nI was called the one for the team comes from the Swedish trio latest album darker days the album number eight from them a which they produce themselves very cool stuff uh which also applies to this next track from the Jefferson Airplane oh\n...\nMacintosh Plus a with a truck from the vapor wave classic a called a floral shop at the name of the song\nWas library but with a lot of vapor wave it can be kind of tricky to tell what the ... name is uh that's why we asked a Georgia author grafting tattered to chat with us about this stuff out of the name of the book that he's written on the subject is a babbling court a vapor wave and the modification of ghosts\nAnd graft and oh was that stuff to drop out of the studios of WG a recently to a clue us and [noise]\nThe ground\nAnd thanks for joining us on the show when did you first start listening to vapor when I first started listening to it and and hearing about it probably um\nAs I was about to get out of college twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty Thirteen maybe um and by this time a lot of what would eventually be my favorite vapor wave releases would have already would have been out by then you know so I was gonna be coming out the tell tale in 'em and uh was\nInto it on a just a purely musical level like the way it sounded shirt\nAnd if you had to describe it to someone who's never heard they way before how how would you characterize the\nDroopy syrup be war slowed down a supermarket music\nAll music right and and when one of the many things that's interesting about vapor wave is that many of these artists are really\nSort of anonymous said that there's the kind of faceless it away right well it's it's interesting because ... ah not only are many of them faceless bed but often it's it's one producer\nOperating under a few\nDifferent aliases and kind of flooding ...\nQuote market so to speak you know those kind of a throwaway aspect to it you know it's supposed to revisit throwaway music\nMuzak or music that I'm exists at the periphery are reframing in a way that is also maybe as throw away um and so uh it would follow it from there that having a ...\nHey that is also maybe as throw away um and so uh it would follow it from there that having a ... a indicator\nWould would mean you know maybe a president's\nUm there's something to with like ... like the um the allure of of of of no author of like letting the tax just stand for itself sure\nAnd and another interesting aspect to this is that a lot of vapor waved as a service is based in cassette culture which when these very limited runs of of of these records disappear that they tend to drive up the prices astronomically right for collectors\nAre not only that but but a floppy disks wow anything that limited and that kind of femoral I mean\nIt it would make sense then because the music itself is supposed to be a sort of you know reframing I kind of\nAt the margins music sort of a you know taking the fleeting experience may be moving through a consumer space and listening to a certain kind of music almost subconsciously and pack you know\nA boiling that down breaking it up and looping and sampling it um it it it makes perfect sense then that the physical\nA result of that is going to disappear to the excellent way to drive demand you know but it's also I think what what is going on here as a sort of Snapchat like embrace of just a media that disappears content that disappears you\nAnd tell us a little bit about this a truck that you picked out for us to midnight lover buy a new dreams limited um I Love the way it opens with a real low a slowdown voice of this the CBC\nAnd I and and a lot of like almost channel surfing to the radio it's very very like collapse
