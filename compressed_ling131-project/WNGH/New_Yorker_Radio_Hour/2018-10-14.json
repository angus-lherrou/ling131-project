A. G. P. B. S. W. A. G. P. H. D. Rome portable at Georgia Public broadcasting radio network [noise]\n\nIn Manhattan\nCovert action in the New Yorker WNYC studio ...\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is\nIf somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all Sue Halpern has been writing for the New Yorker about election security\nAnd what she's found should scare us all slogan lamb\nIs a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty six team at the height of the presidential election it started poking around Kennesaw State University Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election stuck in a small dog\nI did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections stuck in a salt dot edu Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this this particular searched didn't turn that up and instead I found it very\nCurious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought wow that's that seems a little strange\nAnd many crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and lay found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nDon't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems it's by itself will be a huge story but on top of that land also found security hole to which you can download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters I had access\nTo their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number\nAnd their driver's license number and then there were also gyms databases and the gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count [noise]\nIf slogan lamb had been a bad guy and this would have been a boon to answer\nScariest scenario I can think of would be an attacker\nImplanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise that Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise] this is right around the ...\nThe attacker of compromise the Web server to the beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise] this is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system\nTo protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information started to trickle out [noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked\nAbout Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know\nWhat this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously\nBut others seem to have left themselves wide open [noise]\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that's their authority but they're not cyber security experts citizen green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia are computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely has machine that don't have a paper ballot\nAnd then there's also other machines which can paper about those are also computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why having the paper ballot it's so crucial because it\nCan be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why finding the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted currently\nElection security folks on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines [noise]\nWell many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep angst that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\n[noise]\nWe spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that\nPurge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections or whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nThis has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in ...\n[noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names warrant on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nNeed another well\nThis one's got nearly ...\nAnother way\nAnother way\nUm well let me see\nGoing to miss the snow [noise]\nI'm going to miss the be um the things that go\nI'm going to miss the tree\nGonna miss the sun\nUm miss the animals and I miss you ever want\nUm [noise]\nI Need to know the play\nWell that the\nNeed to know where\nThis one ... nearly ...\nUm ... the bird\nSinging all this ...\nUm well ... when\nBeen kissing me so long [noise] another one\n[noise] another\nAnother way\nUm [noise]\nWas beauty of beauty isn't it you do you ever do you say you were checked in with a known about the songs that they do how much do tease out what the song is about\nOh I didn't try I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change you know\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter]\nSixties and in many moments in between ... and\nJust how does this seem\nSimilar a different [noise] um it's just I couldn't have dreamed us up\nAll the stuff I've been through and all the countries don't dictatorships and ah you know I'm In through all that if somebody is had said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just now what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you release me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life\nIt's ... you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay to lying no problem no perjury yeah not a problem\nUm and said that that is a new normal\nAnd how has it changed the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning\nAs yeah proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to law oftentimes hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety\nAnxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial\nThat's great advice yeah and um don't expect much and keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary get forget which one it was because the ... the scene appears in so many documentaries abusing it\nOh yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary you forget which one it was because this\nThis scene appears in so many documentaries of you singing at the march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize in your mind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and singing [laughter] it was a half million people or whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and\nYou know I think as I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph\nI think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know what I'm In that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nDo you mean there's some there's some times that you were in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea\n[noise] I think festival a political moment\nYeah I'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like an aunt you know they're just ... people\nAnd so I had a hand then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever and in yours and mine yeah\n... you know this next song that you're going to do I I went to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these these ... relatives of people who lost people in the church there in this in this slaughter\nAnd it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a when too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of\nA president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that not only is the crowd with him and to feel they feel like allies\nBut he's able to sing the song and begin the song that lifts people locked as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um [laughter] yes how do you remember that that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the song [laughter] well\nYeah how do you remember that that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the\nWell covering this song it was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future this song just dropped out of the sky threatened by the way most for it I did not know and most people didn't know um [noise] they need to\nDo you get to talk I mean if I was Quaker a tune that you can only be knocking that guitar and you're not getting your hearing it loudly\nJust go ahead yeah okay\n... men came to the house of prayer and they did not has what brought him\nHe was not friend he was not keen but they open the door\nThey let him me\nAnd for an hour the strangers that he didn't he sat with them many seem to pray\nBut then a young man to God and kill\nThe war on yeah\nCharlotte and in the month of June ...\nSome mourners gathered in a room\nWith President came to speak so\nAnd the cameras roll\nCould say what must be said\nFor all the living

be made whoa\nNo one could say what must see\nFor all the living and so on that day\nThe president and sang\nAmazing grace\nA man thing or a\n...\nEach night after a long track you know call Eli give them his medical condition and his coordinates if he was ever in trouble he could call for what he referred to as the most expensive taxi ride in the world which will be a rescue plane to pull him out\nBut\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of its day which could then be posted on his website and it updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\nGood evening everybody all the way it was a show like the grace of course was this\n[noise]\nHe was encouraged that linkage king\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and Wales so that someone in the special forces was very very glamorous [noise]\nThey are wild and Wales so that someone in the special forces was very very glamorous\nLike contentious paper\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nKid recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites uh she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world than Antarctica\nFor all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nHe really was a true romantic he loved parent Trey\nHaters loved ah he\nHe did tapestry\nDitched the most wonderful\nTastes legit skating across the snow\nIn the history of all these old explore as then\n... that lives that has had\nA fit [noise]\nNo I\nDidn't have\nAny worshipped Ernest Shackleton built in many ways a was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self he set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nFor like\nA bell\nAnd so needed decision that always astonished hadn't even worse Lee\nHe decided to turn\nThat really\nAnd and his other ... most famous expedition that Shackleton\nHad wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great tries to be achieved\nBut before even reached Antarctica ship or the difference that frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was she was able to guide all the men in his immediate party and get them back home alive\nI Know that they have no\nHis immediate party and get them back home alive\nI Know that they have for the very far I I read them for\nYears the Charles de Gaulle Soviet storage and every ... ... ... cars expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition would very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer and the model that he lived by was a Shackleton family model which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning belts when he came back from a trip to says ... just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave [noise]\nIt wasn't until\nWhen he was about forte that he does it really took about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nSo by the time that Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children max and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole I'm\nA you know have kids were a little bit will dirt but a joy and it was very supportive\nOf us well huge believe as that and trying to fulfill the dreams I lost at the time my rich still he's from fulfilling you are an individual dreams\nBecause you've failed you have to get permission from the other person and I felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had a lot of fun and he went into the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town really\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across Antarctica to fulfill the goal that his hero shock then was not able to achieve what he wanted to do it alone [noise]\nSasha by just keep you\nOn TALK of seven on the trail or not\nEach day was simple\nYou can pick up to a long time several they vote in the trial or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up early in the morning and you're not going to lead this usually took about an hour as harness we'll be connected to the black and he will begin to haul it done in like a mule\nSkiing full Ninety minutes dragging a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories than a day\nOr every craving food fish by bond brash double cream stay here small chips potato X Y Z brave\nNew this particularly in a time can challenge during the day after day there was something almost primal about it there's always\nHis singular purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was ultimately accomplish his goal\nNine blonde pole ... because I was leaving everybody in some say\nThe law in ... southern ... hard one to work for a little bit longer today just a ... a good day for anyone\nGunpoint current you know ... ... but he knows them all there's all I can do them I Would call a day\nHe would crack for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien

if you're the lead scare criticized miles\nHave timed it could take my heart\nFelt constant string of making his mileage so that he could reach the end point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season and start to cope with the temperature drops even further it can reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven Aly shuts down then and at that point that would be no exit\n[noise] if you go through all of those should be\nAble to\nDo sort of the year\n... which says to them [noise]\nThey were goals record store or a joke at the
