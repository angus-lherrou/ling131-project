I was\nWith my family if you grow up in a big family like me I have over fifty first cousins while our mother had my grandmother had twelve children well\nAnd I have a huge family and so I was with them a lot and I come from a musically inclined family my great grandmother's are both play oriented piano what their churches um the church was it was a huge inspiration from\nEqually to sing in church the in the in a way that singers that I'm from an earlier generation did the way they are we said the kind of grow up knowing the music of Sunday Morning on Saturday Night\nYou know\nI did sing in church but it's not the type of song that she was saying it would be signed in church is not tradition ...\nNo I actually was that five six year old kid who would be sitting in the Pew and in my past her would be between yelling and sweating and about to get the holy ghost and I would bust out in the Michael Jackson to beat it and then I'd be escorted out to the children's church [laughter]\nKinda got kicked out yeah I was ... I was a rebellious Christian [laughter]\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records in radio\nI did have access to musical theater and what else did you play as we get our Cinderella\nI can totally I we we did we did a production or I went to a predominantly all black a high school Latina a Latino and black high school and\nUm she's got all the lead singer I didn't actually it's funny when did you not get to lead the whiz I did not get the whiz I Want it to be Dorothy so you're still mad about it\n[laughter] I'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed\nYou get the whiz I Want it to be Dorothy so you're still mad about it [laughter] I'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really crush me\nDon't at what point did you think I can have a big life or something that's beyond being in the high School Musical something beyond being a may be the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think it registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy and I started to learn more and I started to grow and\nWhen I realized that there was just more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an axis potential that was there and that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell\nUs your story who we are heroes with a Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration and I love Judy Garland arguing Judy Garland were were my my my heroes pretty different performers why those two\nThey were just women that I felt really use their voices unit had a first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland\nObviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that um I feel like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life but Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who did an album and made a career\nFully being herself she did not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not\nHave a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a singer uh she was a producer she was a poly math and that was how one model my career\nAnd now let's hear a song from an early album that's called violet stars happy hunting and this is from an album called metropolis betray sweet\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] I haven't heard it in a long time now that sounds like something out of out of a musical is that what you set out to write [noise]\nYes you know what will I wouldn't say a musical why I wanted to do was figure out how I could sing songs [noise]\nHalf concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent found\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it inspire all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that by the stars heavy hunting that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take\nHow can I take all of me onstage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing I Love ... love rock and roll 'em I Love you know dressing and is black and white tuxedo to pay homage to my family I Love David Bowie I just got an a bully at that time I loved pink Floyd the ... the wall I Love\nIsaac Asimov I Love science fiction how can I blend all these these ah these different elements and and innovate in in in the space of of music\nYou had in those in those early days an alter ego Cindy may weather ... is that you were hiding behind her but you were projecting this self which was um a a complicated thing which all that you were um\nWhy use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in in the latest album dirty computer\nI think that Cindy Mayweather represented represented aspirations for me [laughter] that's who I strive to be more like a nurse so she is in the future and in the future she's more evolved and she\nDoesn't have eagle all the things that make me imperfect she's able to master those\n... so this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yes somewhere absolute what we're used to being so critical about in your in your younger self\nWell my younger self I just felt a misunderstood a lot of people will call me we're there'll

true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff\nThat has maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter Eliza Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania\nWhether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter laws Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards\nAnd they're really unhappy about it\nOne of the communities allies have visited was exton Pennsylvania is suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAccent is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we saw Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty six teams in the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans\nAnd yelled for al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance we're Going Rogue\nOr on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of brac inside and final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nI have you heard about running for office Danielle joins around you do okay well I actually live right on top and drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here than feelings that\nWe had pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nFive fifty feet of my backyard like\nSeventy feet from my house and\nUm we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fear is Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impacts heavier fears about it impact your life um [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in ... county in Pennsylvania with us no co pipeline that was only a week old\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and it was a snow could pipeline that was only a week old [noise]\nAnd so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nLike my babies like burning in their bed [noise]\nAnd um [noise] I called them and I said we have to move like have to move we can't [laughter] I'm like\nThankfully in beaver county there were only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless straight um\nThose things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality\nSo you know we're here trying to connect the dots between what's going on politically\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics [noise]\nJust an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occurred to me I just saw something I ever\nLike maybe I thought\nIt would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just a lack of humanity from are the people who represent us [noise]\nIt's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reach representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I in the proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community [noise]\nThen she listed her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics to build the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe\nHe is eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics for the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline and fracking has made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America and\nAnd that's brought in a lot of different players including ... and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nView of engineering and environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design on pipelines to follow the safest round the smaller environmental\nATP is a private corporation testing that they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east to markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nRight now Daniel Ratcliffe is in a new play called the lifespan of a fact\nAnd this may be the only work if you're ever written to give a leading role to a fact checker and injustice I may say that we're all glad to see rectified\nNow the fact checkers at the New Yorker I don't want to brag but they have something of a reputation so when Radcliffe want it to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand at it here's Peter can be who runs to fact checking department\nSo they know wrecked coach showed up at my office shortly after ten on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about theater for the New York\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] and he didn't look unlike under ...\nAnd I wondered whether that has something to do with his intense immersion in the play where it is the fact checker mortal combat where there was a great writer\nBecause that was one of one of the [noise] you just sort of the news business\nWith a writer ...\nBecause one of one of the\nThe the Sadrists that flows ... sit in like ... asking if I see a as no but I see to differentiate between ... one of the articles of things in my certain things that um I have sort of gifts for white to everything everything\nI mean the thing is people who don't aren't familiar with the second most exciting things are either factor opinion and we check the facts and relieved opinions alone to us the\nBigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to correct they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more kind of them are just kind of akin to other things you may there are kind of comments that's typical judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make comments that she go judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on unlike go at least you have a phone call schedule but the chef of a Mexican restaurant not alive and train them down so we're I mean that\nThe planet the plan was down Daniel red cliffs and check a short restaurant reviewer with tables in the ground for two written by hand a gold field herself a former tractors\nShe was very pleased to hear you can check your face [laughter]\nWay he'll she gets yeah cancer confidence shortly view of a restaurant a Mexican restaurant called ... and um when we started a new checker we sit them down with a manuscript and have them under lined up for what they think is ... fact and what's not\n[noise] what do the right to underlined or details from like the the ingredients from the nails\nYeah gas up with old saying what his own held by seasoning the seasoning and so then she wants you to check that and that's the kind of thing you can boast do off the website and then check was chef yes and for your call is set up with a dull Evan while\nI'm going to [noise] going to say that Ron [noise] ... [noise]\nWhat she really haven't heard of it is similar to the beaches soupy I ...\nI knew you also when when there's kind of like a negative judgment in there you would do is back off and make it yeah I guess\nLike lava yeah well ... yeah well we're ...\nWe're so ... it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach as pathetic the problem with that is\nYeah well ... yeah well we're\n... we're so ... it's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach as pathetic\nThe problem with that is just absolutely if he says no it doesn't have a vendor speak idea for some reason he was offended by that formulation it's ... it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like a California beach just said like um [noise]\nAfter you're done with this was set up a job interview or to switch careers like they have a much easier to do right now [laughter] so less pressure\nBoom after I saw the ... have had a good from quite grasp on what was ... was not I walked around the corner to have them work with Parker Henry another ... one of my deputy scientifically\nOr in the high dollar down like how I exercise every day when you marry them on the earth smash\nParker and Daniel when there are multiple website where they looked at a news prices and photos of the restaurant\nYeah right yeah yeah I don't\nKnow I was ... I mean look at California for everyone it's cause we're seeing something called the worst\nThings so just because Parker ... to ... go has the Venice Beach five doesn't mean that that's the way the chef ... describe it yeah\nI Know it's a bit of the deep\nState so I don't know like how are you in fact\nI'm either frame it like you have no idea that sentence when they have access to them I'm playing down his key city actually\nAre eleven o'clock college fast approaching okay I'm going to get it on speaker phone in the library on my cell phone yeah\nHi Justin I'm Down to the New Yorker I'm Wondering if you had a few minutes see what our system some questions about it\nHi Justin I'm Down to the New Yorker I'm Wondering if you had a few minutes to an ... system some questions about as a review of of your restaurant and I'm just trying to fact check it and make sure everything's accurate\nYeah of course so first off your son's name is spelled B\nA the D.
