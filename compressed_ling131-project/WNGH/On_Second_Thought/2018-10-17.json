learn more about the death penalty and executions process here in Georgia and nationally Rhonda Cook covered the criminal justice system and executions in Georgia since the Nineteen nineties for the AJC and she joins us in Studio\nHello Ronda they're welcome also with us is ... he's a staff writer for the Marshall project that's a nonprofit news organization cover and criminal justice in the U.S and Morris welcome traveling so round at just curious how you got onto this beat and the first place [noise]\nWell it it like a lot of things\nIt's welcome forever so Rhonda just curious how you got onto the speed and the first place [noise] well it it like a lot of things in my career it was all an accident I started covering prisons right out of the box when I became a reporter in Nineteen Seventy seven and\nIt just sort of evolved into this and I because I covered prisons that led to the death penalty and an execution since they're the ones that carry out the punishment\nAnd the department of corrections selects five media witnesses for each execution that's a rule that you felt for dozens over the span of two decades or about their [noise] the first execution you witness that was in Nineteen Ninety six ... what do you remember about that day\nWell I I don't remember much about the executions I've covered some might argue it's a defensive thing um but\nI mean we're there to block them out yes and I but I Do remember that is one of the two that I Do remember and it was Larry long shark and he was convicted of a a triple murder\nAnd Larry long shore did not appeal\nIs his conviction he he sort of did right at the last minute but then changed his mind the next day\nAnd I do remember that one that one was an electrocution is the only electrocution that I witnessed\nBut um I Do remember that one because it was my first because I knew launch are well because it was an electrocution there lots of reasons why I remember that one and you said there was another ... the other one that I Do remember was Kelly gifts and Dan or a couple of years ago\nShe was convicted of having her lover kill her ... her husband\nAnd that one stands out not because uh Kelly gifts and dinners the only woman I've seen executed but because she's saying um amazing grace right up to she could no longer sing in that stands out that's\nPretty telling it for you as a reporter governed by the principles of objectivity did witnessing all those executions leave you with any thoughts about capital punishment in Georgia or otherwise\nBecause I'm not all I wasn't allowed to have those thoughts um Georgia is very efficient\nThey um the closest I've ever come to having a problem was with one of Kelly ... not that at the time she was executed by the time before that and they stepped in and stopped it because there was a problem with the drugs it was cold and have been stored at temperatures that we're too cold and the solids in the in the drawer\nStepped in and stopped it because there was a problem with the drugs it was cold it had been stored at temperatures that we're too cold and the solids in the in the drug had the gun to separate from the liquids and so in an abundance of caution they stopped that execution and he was carrying out about six months later\nBut er Georgia um has been drama free they've they've got it\nPretty much down to it is a rhythm to it\nMore he says something you've covered a death penalty stories all over the country Georgia has had about four hundred and Ninety One executions since Nineteen twenty four I'm Rhonda mentioned the states and fish and see how how does Georgia compared to other states in terms of just the numbers\n[noise] um I mean it's kind of right in the middle you know you have states like taxes that carry out many many executions are all those kind of famous culturally for it um and then you have states that I've abolish the death penalty totally a you have states that have the death penalty on the books and they sent them to be able to death but the sort of\nGets squeamish about actually carrying out an execution and George is right in the middle and that you know it\nCarries out I'm a maybe ten execution some years if you are a few more\nBut it's um it's a it's a state that kind of wants to kind of keep the system rotting in a in a kind of efficient way like Ron said a but it also doesn't appear to want to kind of get the reputation of a place like taxes of\nBeing you know bloodthirsty are carrying these out over and over and over again um [noise] I mean there were times you know in other states where there were two a week and I don't know the examples like that in Georgia though ... correct me if I'm\nWrong only one that I uh well there's one that I there were a couple that I Do recall in one\nWas that the Larry long shower there was one that came to the very next day and then uh my memory tells me there was another one more recent and um but um those things didn't tend to leave my mind after they're of course how many on death row now in Georgia\nIs around fifty five or six I'm I'm not really sure the number but it's somewhere between fifty and sixty [noise]\nGo ahead Murray\nOh it's going to say that what happens is you know every state the carriers out executions no matter how many are how few every once in a while a case kind of pops up in the media and becomes a big deal sometimes it's because of issues with the lethal injection drugs like the ... ... execution or those you know of a ... foot tall\nSeparated other cases are it's like Troy Davis where there is a release um clear concern about someone\nThe ... or those you know if a ... foot tall separated other cases are it's like Troy Davis where there's a release um clear concern about someone being innocent or in the case of ... or a woman no kind of very sympathetic figure and you find that these cases really kind of travel in the public mind because I say\nI'm going to bring up a lot of ambivalence that people might have about the punishment\nAnd in her case she was a he was the person who was put to death while at length I Believe her lover who actually committed the murder or with connected and then that's that's correct he ... he agreed to a ... and she declined to take the same she had the same offering she did not take it\nAnd she went to trial and and the jury chances to death sentence\nPunishment and Marie this is ... ... a brown dimension that first execution she sounds like an electrocution later lethal injection was adopted by the state of Georgia something the Marshall project has done a lot of reporting on it a little bit of that some of the complications\nThat said that had entertaining legal injunction drugs for execution\nShores so lethal injections a became a form of execution um for a lot of states beginning in the Nineteen eighties and continuing up through the nineties and the whole idea was that they would be a sort of more humane way of executing people that it would kind of look more like a clinical stroke hospital setting [noise]\nNot to put too fine a point on it but sometimes you just want to listen to music and sometimes

soon take center stage at the University of Georgia, Georgia museum of art and tomorrow we meet Richard ... he's the legendary artist behind the work we're going to be talking with him about his life and work in an outside of the studio\nElection manipulation the cyber security breach that held the city of Atlanta for ransom hacks of Facebook Equifax target and millions of people's data\nClearly our computers are vulnerable\nAtlanta is one of the fastest growing high tech metro areas in the U.S and now ranks third in cities with the most fortune five hundred at headquarters\nAnd this week thousands of cybersecurity experts are going to be gathering at cyber security Atlanta to discuss their concerns about the industry security and a lack of it and joining me this morning art to cybersecurity experts the events director David juniper is with us and chief hacker Joshua crumble\nTo you both for joining us thank you All right so David you're the one with the English accent for the for the help of our listeners start with you what are the pay off the hackers are looking for when they go into a computer or a network or on the order\nFor the help of our listeners start with you what did they passed that hackers in looking for when they go into a computer or a network\nWere I mean you know or they're trying to do is get\n... to an organization um or an individual so that might be someone else a credit card information or more beer companies so which I can only the old run them or for the um or to be sending back information on on the dealt with a credit card information et cetera\nSo it does have this idea that hackers are notorious secretly breaking into systems to steal information or credit card numbers as David mentioned\nYou are the white hats variety of hacker signing weakness system so what are the chief reasons computers or systems I left on them all\nYou know it might be slightly controversial but if my belief that it is completely people that are the reasons that we have so many issues\nTake the the Georgia\nA malware attack Iran somewhere incident that recently happened there were vulnerabilities that were on patched and were well known vulnerabilities on their perimeter that allowed this to happen\nAnd if you take it back even further it's the bad code the insecure coating practices of the developers that caused that to happen as well and so it's my belief that cyber security is really more of a human issue than it is a technical or computer issue\nAnd it's more about changing our society from the ground up to make sure that when we write code for writing it more secure and and when we find out about vulnerabilities that exists within our networks or on a on our perimeter that are public or Internet facing that we get them properly patched and timely manner\nSo that the bad guys the hackers out there they can't exploit those\nAnd they can't exploit our people because our people are being more security aware and are paying attention before they just start clicking on things\nHere is the mayor Kesha Lance bottoms talking about that attack specifically\nIs much bigger than the ransom where attack this really is an attack on our government which means is an attack on all of us\nSo what do we know about the people who ended up holding the CD for ransom for city by the way he declined to pay\nA ... you know there uh there's a lot of uh suspicions about who actually was involved in that uh you know I I'm going to have declined to comment\nA ... you know there uh there's a lot of uh suspicions about who actually was involved in that uh you know I I'm gonna declined to comment because it says a lot of uh a lot of people assuming that they know\nBut what we do know is that they were exploiting known vulnerabilities within systems that really should never have been exposed to the Internet and the first place\nA such as a remote desktop which is just a way to remotely asked to or a access any computer but if you ask any cyber security professional or ethical hacker they'll tell you that that should be behind a secure system and so it's a it's a hygiene thing that uh that needs to be fixed and\nHow we are public organizations decide CDs are most vulnerable to these kind of a ransomware attacks\n[laughter] that's a loaded question on honestly everybody is highly vulnerable to these types of attacks in my career is unethical hacker I've yet to find a single network or system that I couldn't gain access to take full complete control over\nAnd we're talking anything from pipelines to taking remote control of oil rigs to some of the largest financial institutions in human markets and the world\nAnd so the reality is is where we sit right now\nAny hacker if it were targeted enough could easily breached systems and we're always talking in terms of data breaches and fortunately most cybercrime is financially motivated but if somebody had more nefarious a more I guess purposes or goals if\nWe could be talking a loss of life instead of\nJust loss of data or loss of income or loss of reputation and so I think it's something that we really need to take seriously as a society and understand that with all this new technology that we love\nIt brings new threats and and it brings a centrally a war front right to our our front door and its cyber but it can affect us in our everyday life and and that means we need to be more security aware\nOf the day to day and John Schumann sang our lives are increasing the integrated with computers you know thinking of the Internet and everything your smart home device in your car your pacemaker things said easy watching television or movies could have I was living in perpetual fear do you live in here\nWhy don't you can kind of thought or otherwise we would we would be nice but I think doing things all having events like so skewed to land a I'm bringing awareness\nCan you can live ... ... or otherwise we wouldn't we wouldn't be at home with our lives but I think doing things or having events like cyber security Atlanta I'm bringing awareness to disarm security not just to an end to ... big companies that we have within the news but making people to weigh\nIn on an individual basis or you know making sure or as you said you know making sure you patch you hung compete is making sure that your calls with that I doing everything you can and there's also you know people all that\nThe biggest weakness within cyber security and so about ... ... I'm On the standing where those potential weaknesses on educating you'll you'll stop even if your company of you know five to ten people you know multinational which\nYou need to understand where the risks the risk of all I'm and by coming to an event like cybersecurity Atlanta you can learn like threats all you can have from the ex but you can see what's coming up and you can talk to the end is that it yet but\nIn this field a ... you need to do to protect yourself and they both as an organization\nSaid when we hear about a tax on the city of Atlanta for example and I understand that hospitals are also often targeted to a university often targeted\nWe have a sense I think that well I don't know if my data was affected so how do people really pay enough attention you know like how attacks like this might affect you personally\n[laughter] [noise] yeah I think the people do have to\nTake notice a you know the latest breach with with Facebook which is obviously a lot of people use that needs to make sure that you you go back on the ice but to see if you were one of the account affected and make sure that you've a date it'll all go through that that probably to go and ... they recommend that you should do [noise]\nSo I think the more that it is it in the media um I think most people will be aware of it and the more that we push to make sure that companies are making sure they tell people if that has been a breach um ... they can do whatever they can protect their data or you know it it's not going away um you know ...", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "17"}
