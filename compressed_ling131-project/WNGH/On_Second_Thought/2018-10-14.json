guess\nOr provocative at St Louis university law professor ... walk or make the argument that contemporary ideas about diversity came from arguments against integration championed by twenty century white writers and influential black intellectuals\nThey caught up with him to foreign event at the Jimmy Carter presidential library stock about his book the burning house Jim Crow and the making of modern America\nI asked him about that title the burning house which is a term that was used both by James Baldwin and William Faulkner but Baldwin on like the N. double ACP challenge the idea that assimilation should be the goal for African Americans so what was Baldwin argument\nSo James Baldwin came from a tradition of very critical thinking about the United states or his family left the south moved to New York\nAnd hey rankled that the idea that the solution to racial injustice in America was to assimilate African Americans into mainstream white society this was the holding and brown versus board of education in Nineteen fifty four\nAnd Bob and said wait a minute why should we want to assimilate into white society maybe whites could learn from our history and our traditions wide America's a burning house\nThe other African American writers or Ralph Ellison Zora Neil Hurston you quote on the book and write about them in detail intellectuals and leaders argued that forced integration\nInspired art like jazz and blues and created the resilience and separate Folkways among African Americans was that an argument for Jim Crow\nIt was so uh as early as Eighteen nineties news south boosters like Henry ... here in Georgia Charles Bradley caulk and North Carolina\nArgued and this was the aspirational case for segregation\nShare it also included this franchise when a discrimination but a lot of progressive said this system of separating the races as going to create a diverse society African Americans and whites will create their own institutions their own traditions their own schools even though and art\nAnd this will enable us to live in harmony to work closely side by side but also to preserve our separate identities\nTill ... Henry Grady mansion argued that African Americans they didn't need to be absorbed into Anglo saxon culture and could develop their own with an idea of just by cultural parallels societies living side by side\nIt was and it was a right hand\nCulture and could develop their own which is an idea of just by cultural parallel societies living side by side\nIt was and it was a right hand turn away from what had been going on in the south before the civil war\nHe pointed at time has come to mind that I have talked about the need for racially upon and they say you know for safety and for liberation\nAnd these were early twentieth century intellectuals or mid ... century intellectuals writing at a time like hip hop from Michael Jordan are Colin Powell were virtually on a matching up all\nHell why didn't they re examination at that time tell us today\nBut I think it\nUs to tell a different story about American history\nAnd a lot of ways the south saves America and the Nineteen twenties the United states was going down to very dark road we were trying to create to support an Anglo saxon Protestant society there was this basic view that the American stock was Anglo saxon Protestant northern European\nMax Weber's Protestant work ethic and the spirit of capitalism convince people that America's the capitalist country was successful precisely because Anglo saxon Protestant said built it we enact strict immigration restrictions to keep out\nImmigrants from southern central Europe menu from a Catholic we enact prohibition to assimilate Catholic immigrants into Protestant society to ... drinking cultures we support eugenics most states had forced sterilization rules for people who are feeble minded\nSo just as a homes in his famous statement at three generations themselves were enough supports this idea of forced sterilization\nAll of these things were pushing us towards a ... a road where we were embracing genetics immigration restrictions creating a ... a kind of\nRace civilized nation so much so that the Germans started taking notes from us in the Nineteen twenties and thirties uh Adolph Hitler and his men more my struggle to my time for talks about the United states as an area\nAnd started taking notes from us in the Nineteen twenties and thirties uh Adolph Hitler and his men more my struggle to my top talks about the United states as an area nation it had used immigration law to keep\nThe United states northern European it'd removed all indigenous people I Native Americans he then appoints lawyers to study American law\nThey like the mandatory sterilization laws they liked the immigration restrictions they liked bans on interracial marriage but the one thing they reject desegregation ...\nThey say segregation is not going to work for us is not going to enable us to create an area and state because that'll mean that minorities do as Germans will have their own institutions their own traditions their own society and the undermined what we're trying to do\nIn a way that's what happens African American successfully by the end of World War two\nNot only endured Jim Crow they didn't prevail they emerge some of the most eloquent exponential of American ideals but those ideals mentioned nothing about Anglo saxon Protestant supremacy their ideals about equality racial justice opportunity democracy\nAnd if we think of America in American history through this lens then the south\nThanks in part to Jim Crow but also to the African American experience really tails and ascendant hopeful story\nMy guest is and just walk on his book the burning has detailed arguments made by black and white intellectual ... twenty century to protect separate cultural traditions in ... which were African American men ... ... now\nLet me get back out those notions of preserving heritage to shortage today [noise]\n\nThis fall we're counting on the participation of everyone who listens to cover the rising cost of the programs we bring you ... if we didn't hear from you during our fall fund drive there still time to support the programs that make a difference in your life [noise] please take a moment now to make an on line\nAn GB if we didn't hear from you during our fall fund drive there still time to support the programs that make a difference in your life please take a moment now to make an on line contribution good a G.

reasonable doubt the Troy Davis project by Atlanta playwright we know the story follows the death penalty case of Troy Davis joining us at ten am on Sunday October twenty first started gp the radio\nAnd Virginia Prescott on second thought and returning to my conversation with Anders Walker author of the burning house Jim Crow in the making of modern America\nWalker is a legal scholar but his book points to arguments made by writers and intellectuals in the twentieth century against integration and these notions read as offensive and flatly racist\nBut Walker proposes that by excavating them and putting them in historic context reveals more about the roots of pluralism embedded in American culture and eventually law\nWell he's got to prove that to me before the break we talked about the Gulf between concepts of coexistence championed by white southern writers like Robert Penn Warren who want it to protect their once dominant culture\nAnd black intellectuals like James Baldwin and Zora Neil Hurston who's thought a level of separate ... that would protect their culture a culture that had been violently suppressed tobacco\nTo enter the walk and then how does this idea of preserving culturally identities figure into the current debate over Confederate monuments for example the idea that\nMany of them as we know were built during the civil rights movement in opposition to the civil rights movement as symbols of cultural heritage yet a lot of people contemporary southerners hold on to them as symbols of their cultural heritage\nWell instead of statues of rubber they leave I think we should have statues of my book and I think that aspect of southern history as something that the south can double down on and I think that's something we should commemorate and I think Confederate statue\nAnd I think that aspect of southern history as something that the south can double down on and I think that's something we should commemorate and I think Confederate statues if they're contextualize correctly\nAre important historical markers precisely because they emerged much later than the civil war Nineteen tens Nineteen twenties and in a weird way if you think about it to commemorate civil war leaders in the Nineteen twenties wasn't middle finger not just that civil rights activists but at the federal government so\nI think that we said we should rethink southern history and I think this tradition of diversity of something positive I think we should abandon the idea and actually reject the idea that the south had anything to do with the kind of ethnic nationalism that was going on in Europe\nHow that ended pluralism and multiculturalism become associated with northern liberals I mean even cosmopolitan is and more sophistication among and I know I Wonder if that meant for the division of northern and southern culture\nSo the way most people think of multiculturalism and diversity is that these are ways to achieve integration these are ways to kind of achieve a plural society and that tradition\nAs far as I can tell really comes from other places Canada's what so candidate began to develop a discourse of multiculturalism to deal with the French thread obsession and says candidate began to talk about [noise] a different kind of society pluralistic society there was also about quality\nNow the one thing that Lewis F pal junior does not do is talk about equality and then a string of opinions he rarely shuts the door on things like affirmative action reparations aggressive measures to achieve racial balance of schools\nHe strikes down bussing across school district lines and in that sense that say southern legacy\nWhich is yes on diversity but no on government programs to achieve equality\nAnd that we could say is a negative but the thing is Powell and writes the big opinion so he is really the source\nAnd it this is a slice of history that a lot of people don't know about no matter where you live you learn about the civil rights movement or at least can some broad outlines and the idea that America is supposed to be entertained it an estimated\nThat have you had any backlash from presenting the whole point of view and his book\nI I'm expected some backlash expected people to say wait a minute are you saying that brown was wrong this was the greatest decision of the twentieth century\nThe point of view and his book well I I'm expected some backlash expected people to say wait a minute are you saying that brown was wrong this was the greatest decision of the twentieth century and in fact people have been open to my argument and I think it's because\nMillennials younger Americans are over the moment where we believed full assimilation into mainstream white society was the way to go and I think now of all times not just due to black lives matter movement for black lives but the Trump presidency\nThis is a low point for white folks in this country the Trump presidency is confirming many of the fears and many people had\nThat white people in America are native is their anti immigrant they're fearful of integration their feel fearful of new ideas and if you look at the contrast between the Obama presidency and the Trump presidency the Obama presidency seems to be more aspirational more laudable and forward looking and less riddled with fear and\nParanoia and in a weird way I think folks like Tallahassee coats have responded to this and said white Americans of burning house we need to think more carefully about whether we want to integrate into it\nI heard just like a clip of that and I was like what the heck is that\nUm and then to sort of like buy kismet encountered again when I was just digging for eclectic weird stuff at a record store was that habit a digging for eclectic weird stuff that record stores kind or I or I remember on that particular day I went into walks three records in Decatur, Georgia still a very beloved record store for me\nAnd like yeah just with the intention of I'm finding something that would like it seemed like a really cool obscure reference for me to drop your future [laughter] you know I'm a teenager and trying to cultivate I don't know his personality\nAs a musician a John who are through the magic of radio is with us now but when you hear this she will be living in Los Angeles she's actually going to come back to Atlanta next month on to her for her new album which is called water music well a couple of years ago it was ... that band performed at the early and you've got to perform with them is that how did that come together\nMy God those maybe one of the very coolest thing just happened to me and my life um I have a great relationship with the URL they've always been very kind to me over the years and I just sort of begged them\nIn my life um I have a great relationship with the URL they have always been very kind to me over the years and I just sort of begged them I was like can I please ... to choose\nAnd they're like yeah that makes sense um [laughter] and they and [laughter]\nSo uh so that happened and what came of it was um the the original founding member who is in that version the band ... listen to my whole set he reportedly cried during my sit in front of the sound engineer as they enjoyed my music [laughter] and ah\nAnd then he brought me up on stage for their encore song which was um one of the first songs by them I'd ever heard plenty FISA feces\nAnd I like wept on stage singing it with them\nAnd triumphant beautiful moment ah after that we stayed in touch and he actually asked me to join the band wow and uh how was oh God it was so insane I was getting like my visa ready to go to Brazil and rehearse with them\nAnd it would have been my first time going to Brazil ever a as a member of my favorite band of all time and then unfortunately it just kind of fell apart they're toward plans just didn't materialize the way they were supposed to and that plan just kinda dissolved sadly\nBut you still had your your cry fest onstage at the early\nYeah and I got to know that ah that lives within just thought of me in that way as kind of a member of the family and that I don't know it's just something I'll treasure\nForever that's beautiful and you do thing in Portuguese or at least you did on your last record and not on this one so why not\nUh yeah it it's sort of um is there is just happenstance but I often do right and sing in Portuguese uh I like to think of the language is sort of another instrument\nBut um as it happened with the ... the songs on this record a lot of my head space was more in kind of an American soul music from the seventies and eighties and also I'm drifting more these days towards composing\nA was an intention to be more just sort of directly communicative with my audience and most of my audience is still at this point English speaking ... um\n[noise] so I'm kind of working a little bit harder on like the stories and what am I telling you and does it matter to you and things like that um but there is a song on the new record that's in French\n... [noise] uh yeah also my mother near miss the word ... can you give me that they're on depending on high school there are so it's a love letter to the ocean\n... ah yeah also my mother and your ... can you can be that they're on depending on high school yeah [noise] ah so it's a love letter to the ocean\nWondering if you if there's a kind of a different version of yourself you singer songwriter or person\nEach of those languages can you inhabit something else and another thing yeah\nActually sometimes I use it to like this guy is a little bit\nLike if I'm writing about something that's I don't know that I'm just not really ready to\nOU an English I can kind of have the little secret that no one who knows me well really you know decipher like especially there are a couple of really sad songs that I've written and I don't really like to be publicly sad\nI feel like it gives too much power to the thing that hurts\nAnd and I kind of stand by that even though I Know it's not what like a yoga teacher would tell me to death [laughter]\nSay to these on their act with the human side and um do I feel like I'm doing my version of that but then I have a couple of songs that are in ... that are about something just really personal and really sad\nAnd it helps me record it and remember it\nIf you care enough you can you know to pay for it and share that experience with me but it's still kinda belongs to me in a way\nSo there's a little bit of a mask that I mean I I mean and the artistic sense I'm not saying that being phony or anything like that\nWhich gets cast aside and your new record water music the first single year or the friend that water music album is called your habitat could you play your habitat for I Would love to\n...\n[noise]\nMm Mm\nMm Mm\nMm Mm\nHabitat makes\nMumbai we're none\nClauses I go\n\n... I\nMean\nI'm living here for\nA\nLiving thing oh you know these and we then oh\nYou could get in this case\nYou know love\nMe but\nYou did to me and maybe in a new\nHome all\nThe time is\nBig emphasis\nOn your habitat and performed here in the studio by a drawn from her record called water music\nI Love that ... and if you have trouble believing in the sentiment at this time you could pretend it's the second day yet so\nThat calls to mind for me a sort of slightly faded a film clips of couples walking along over bridges where the leaves fall down and yeah the onset of what what are we\nBarely got intro credit you know that Cooper bold fought [laughter] yeah yeah some some bell bottoms in there somewhere that kind of thing when\nThe seventies that ... is it that does that sort of California Sound of music maybe I feel like there's the embrace of the sentimental\nI'm In that area that I relate to\nKnow a guy that we got a little bit jaded about sentimentality after that for sure yeah and I feel like it's starting to come back a little bit I feel like the kind of um [noise]\nThe the craze for like distance irony of the nineties in the thousands of like just starting to dissipate a little bit mhm I Know a lot of my friends are into some like very very earnest\nUp you know on the sleeve music nowadays which is refreshing well beyond the singing I and I hear that Joni Mitchell phrasing a little bit in there you said you were really\n... ... you know on the sleeve music nowadays which was refreshing\nWell beyond the singing I and I hear that Joni Mitchell phrasing a little bit in there you said you were really a court and spark wasn't big record it really is beyond the thing that you make a lot of sound you didn't and this one but whistle that that sounds less humid and more like a tropical bird how did you discover your talent for whistling\nI'm great question I have no idea\nCannot remember starting to do that\nUm I Will offer that I'm just sort of a person who habitually and it sounds all the time [laughter] um weather\nJust like in the car in the shower I'm just sort of like screwing around was just like sounds all the time so have a quite a few like weird little parlor trick that mostly but whistling is one of my favorites and I I don't know maybe in my teens I just started doing it all the time and you can you whistle on command which you mhm\nOh sure [noise]\n\n[laughter] ...
