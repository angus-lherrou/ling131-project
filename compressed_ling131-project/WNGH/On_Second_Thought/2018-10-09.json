income communities and twenty sixteen about eighty percent of kids who were eligible for Medicaid or peach care were not enrolled at is the finding of a new report from voices for Georgia\nSixteen about eighty percent of kids who were eligible for Medicaid or peach care were not enrolled\nAt is the finding of a new report from voices for George's children Erika ... is executive director of that organization and joins us in the studio Erica welcome thank you good morning\nAlso joining the conversation Georgia Health News editor Andy Miller Andy great to have you with us leader well it is a grim finding and startling I think but Erika questioned jumps out why aren't low income kids from Georgia getting to health insurance for which there eligible it's a great question\nRight now we have over a hundred and sixty thousand children in Georgia um who don't have healthcare coverage the majority of which like you said over eighty percent of eligible remain uninsured\nThere are several reasons why that is occurring first I Would say the system is just simply not that easy to advocate\nI'm I'm a health care provider a psychologist I consider myself pretty health literate and I will tell you it is challenging to go through that application process mounting an overwhelming busy application process only done in person or is it available online so it's available both in person and on line but there are several challenges to accessing that despite the two\nPoints of access one being that\nI'm the hours of operation again in person support or during working hours the majority of parents of children who are eligible for Medicaid impeach care are working and so they would need to take off work to go there\nLose wages are potentially get in trouble with their employer to be able to do that\nTransportation is also another issue that we heard from communities and being able to get to the offices to access that support and applying\nBut also for the online system Internet access is a huge challenge we heard from communities that although there might be Internet access within city limits for many of our rural communities\nThere just simply as an Internet access at home\nMoreover that say you overcome all those hurdles and you have Internet access you get home from work at your kids settled you log on in the evening to apply and we were learning that the online application was actually shutting down at about five pm\nEvery day and so some parents would spend one two three plus hours entering all their information and they'd get to the end they click submit\nSubmit summit and nothing would happen or it would look like it was submitted but really the information\nAnd didn't reach it uh didn't reach the place and so they would wait minds thinking that their application went through and then learn actually nothing happened with that town let's walk through what it's like I mean you that's a terrible picture obviously but\nIt ... thinking that their application went through and then learn actually nothing happened with that\nTown let's walk through what it's like I mean you that's a terrible picture obviously but so somebody who's trying to get health insurance for their kids say I'm a mom in rural Georgia my son has asthma I Want to make sure he gets his inhaler so what kind of cool to do I have to jump through\nIncreasing rates of

Lawrence hello Karen\nHi how are you know you travel around the state in southwest Georgia helping people understand navigate this process of getting insurance but this is something your family grappled with when you're a teenage son was diagnosed with diabetes how did that diagnosis change things for your family\nWell at the time as a as a mother of three children\nAnd having one of your children you know you find out that your child is suffering with diabetes\nI had insurance on my job at that time so it wasn't really a big challenge for me because I was employed I was able to have health care for my children but as my child grew and got older you know things start to change when your child becomes an adult and health care then you're carrying it no longer can carry your child without a\nLarge extent I'm as he needed health care coverage we have to find ways and that's when I actually was introduced to teach care\nAnd was able to get paid to care for him for a short while because of the need for insulin and other things but we were able to control the diabetes\nAnd moved him into adulthood and at the age of I'm thirty two he created a crisis from an infection\nAnd this is one are being challenged with health care became a big problem and having access to provide him with the kid he needed because he wasn't working young man who in turn\nLost his job due to the fact that it the infection caused him to lose a limb and that way you couldn't go back to work couldn't afford to keep that health care coverage and that led me looking for avenues in which to provide that service for him so what do you do\nUm [noise] through our local hospital here even button a Memorial Hospital which was a hospital where most of his treatment was done with all of it and we were in and out of the hospitals so much um\nI didn't think it all about applying for disability because once the um [noise] he lost a limb then ah he incurred blindness\nThere he had every known condition that a diabetic could curve\nOnce he lost a limb been incurred blindness from there he had every known condition that a diabetic could anchor\nAnd it became a really great expense for the hospital I'm being it was an ended in hospital at the time we had to wait and had to seek out other avenues\nUm he didn't care and that's when I leave it in the hospital to me applied for Medicare and we received the Medicare program and once we received the Medicare program\nStarted getting the hell we needed in this condition worse than to the point he needed but she'll medicines that were not covered under the Medicare program\nSo so and as Lawrence I mean just cascading problems and I'm Wondering if you talk to cancel the only doctor there and clean tiny do you see this tiny thing frequently these kind of cascading problems when someone is who has held his compromise just gets worse and worse condition after condition\nBoom boom boom\nWhen courtship San Francisco was getting ready for a tour of China they decided to play at least some music their audience with no so they put the venerable classical string quartet in the service of music by Michael Jackson or to San Francisco on the next performance today from a piano\nToday is eight till ten tonight on GB\nSupport for G.

I think they were between Thirteen and twenty five to forty percent of people identified as not street you know so this isn't\nSomething that's as rare as I think people assume it is I think that a lot of people are questioning their attractions when they're in their adolescence and these ... these things are kind of coming to the fore\nNow it's interesting too because I think a number of way novels are about being in the closet or about coming out that you chose to explore this middle ground this uncertainty about sexuality what is it about that ambiguity that I think feeds certainly a lot of drama but how do you play that out\nWell honestly I think that honestly that might be the most important part of the parts you know in adolescence were questioning so many things and trying to figure out\nOur place in the world and there is some excellent books about kids who are in the closet and trying to come out I'm Becky Albert tallies uh Simon versus a homo sapiens agenda comes to mind I think she will actually be on with Adam Silver later today and they have another book coming out they have a book coming out today called what if it's us\nThat is that opposite end of the spectrum where you had these two kids who aren't in the closet butter trying to figure out how to\nManeuver in the world but that kind of gray area where kids are trying to figure out like am I same sex attracted do I like\nBoys or girls or both or you know and my attracted to people who don't fit in the gender binary like these are questions at teens are asking just like they are asking like\nWhat do I think about politics what do I think about how do I feel about this that or the other in the world like this is another thing that just this kind of a list I think of things that kids are trying to figure out when they're between you know twelve and Eighteen\nMonths to get a sense of this book in particular the book falls three characters coordinator ... he's called Jupiter Jupiter\nAnd re they're all teenage people of color all wrestling with these complicated feelings about their cells and about each other for you to ... read a little bit of this as a ... a dinner scene can you set it up for us to tell us I\nWill so coup is the ... one boy and two girls coup and Jupiter have been best friends since they were six results if they weren't first grade and ...\nAnd I will so coup is the ... one boy and two girls coup and Jupiter had been best friends since they were six years old and if they were in first grade\nAnd the ... coup has always harbored be secret feelings for Jupiter um who is just very openly and two girls and very openly not into boys [noise] um so it's kind of this idea of him wanting something that he knows he can't has\nAnd it's fine up until this new grow moved to town her name is ray and she kind of throws in both into a bit of a tailspin um so the scene that I'll be reading from is court needs first and coops first encounter with re after knowing that rate and Jupiter has been interacting with out him really being a part of it\nSo this is from court nice perspective\nAnd you didn't tell me that this girl who obviously makes you so happy with come into my house for dinner what was the hotel and she pulled out of my grip and bounds after re with more spring and her step than I've ever seen\nI get to the living room just as mama finishes the introduction it's dead obvious from the shock trapped in Dr ... raised eyebrows after meeting Troy and Emilio that he got no for warning about the non traditional family next door which is fine of course I can just tell he doesn't know what to do with the information\nWe live in a pretty progressive area as mama likes to put it in Bahrain one incident in ninth grade involving some bigots picketing at one of my basketball games in deep south Georgia that to dad life has never really been a big deal\nI'm so used to it not being a big deal in fact they've got their chance shock catches me off guard and now I'm really curious about re\nIt's crystal clear to me that she was flirting with her so great either didn't realize or didn't mind definitely seemed like there was something mutual going on but it's not like ray has I like girls tattooed on her forehead so it's difficult to know for sure\nWhat does raise batting for the same team as Jew and Dr ... doesn't know it it's his daughter was gay and he knew he probably wouldn't have been so shocked by the dead poppy revelation right but then again he looks all happy about whatever what's happened in between the two girls\nAs a matter of fact all five of us can see them sitting at the dining room table giggling and touching each other's hair and examine each other's nails and complimented each other's best features I just heard you say do your eyes are amazing they're like the inside of it just right Bob Cato\nRaise reply oh gosh yours are like tree sat back with by sunlight\nAgain Dr Chan looks

isn't hurt type is race\nWhich leads to other questions how much have we been talking do they see each other outside of school did they hang out at all during my game plan hiatus during dinner I keep my my my mouth shut and my eyes on my plate to keep from staring at\nThem what the hell you plan to do if she gets a girlfriend coup but then mom has one movie do too many poppy made a freaking picture and starts blasting so right you should know you're a lucky girl Courtney in Jupiter or Decatur high royalty that his neck stone reading from her new book ...\nOdd one out is on sale to de so
