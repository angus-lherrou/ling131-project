colleague Adam ... yeah were you thinking about how you\nWould eventually tell your story one day when you were on death row we're writing this book in your head did you think you'd be able to give the world you're a side of this story at some point well I Hope so you know a well worn nobody knows when they dealing with the legal system I didn't know that the legal system had made a I Would love to be able to save\nA mistake but the legal system didn't make a mistake on my case\nAh I went to there for all ... recalls a was born black male and poor\nI went to the death row because the prosecutor was gracious and\nAlso I got to death row\nI began to think about everything that\nI'm a mom had taught me about a fairness compassion and everything but I never saw that I Would end up on death row for crime that I didn't commit I didn't even think the ... of the racial person they stand for just ... opening it put an innocent man on death row [noise]\nUh but make no mistake about it they did and they knew\nThat are well smacked person there had committed a crime in fact wanted the detective told me he said we\nI don't believe you did it\nHe should but you do and I looked at that detect with tears coming down my eyes and oh another detector told me and say\nWe really believe who didn't do it\nWhich says y'all always taken up from one another take these rep for your home boy\nAnd I told that detective there's not a home or in this world\nThat I Would take a rep for like this and so they knew that does Bush didn't match they didn't care um\nWas quoted as to prosecute a war said\nWe didn't get the right one but at least we got worn off the street it was your own defense team you're right in the book that your your your defense attorney told you all you all blacks always say you didn't do something that was your defense attorney that said that absolutely you know ... it was like a the good old boys had got together and\nDecided that uh\nWe will do just enough to make it legal system seemed like oh we went through the proper procedure\nWe would do just enough to make the legal system seemed like oh we went through the proper procedure but how would you feel if\nYou turn it come up and don't even speak to you and just look at you and say I didn't go to law school to do pro bono work and I know we forget it are looked at him and us it would it help if I told you that I was in the ... and and he looked at me and he said the problem with their statement is all of your whole\nIs always doing something Indian saying you didn't do it and this is the current event that I knew that I had to somehow try to win over and make him like me where he would at least\nGive me all the representation that I deserved and but it didn't work you know when he went out and had a blind ballistics bird and\nI often tell people did truth\nAh had I been known to junior I Would have found ... recalls the expert that he went out and got was no expert indeed and what bothers me more than anything\nIs that the judge allow this so called silver to Jimmy or\nDid you is qualified him as being one of the ... best expert that you could get in so I knew then that once they start cultures salmon humor that I Would be found guilty and it cost me Thirty years of my life\nFor speaking to Anthony ... when he was twenty nine years old he was wrongfully arrested and convicted for some murders outside of Birmingham, Alabama and he spent the next Thirty years in prison most of that\nOn death row he was released in twenty Fifteen finally when his conviction was vacated and his new book about the experience is called the sun does shine Anthony I don't know why this is the detail that sticks with me it just does in your book you write how\nUm you you needed this racist defense attorney you considered him your rocky he was your\nYour tallying fighter and then and and you were Apollo Creed and then you write about how ten years later I imagine in prison you saw rocky for for the first time and\nTalent to tell people what you thought when he saw that film\nWhat when I saw it you know you always imagined that your attorney will decide that he will give you a his best and I'm\nRealizing that he had made a mistake and I needed to return because I didn't couldn't afford an attorney and as I said her head to trap somehow try to wind is a turning over\nI said that he had made a mistake and I needed to turn because I didn't couldn't afford an attorney and as I said are you out at the trap somehow try to win this uh turned over to get him to like me it wasn't about being able to pay him where he come from ...\nThis attorney was racist I could tell you that this turned him\nPut every black man and his box in full she was concerned I was no different no better\nI had went out and did a horrible crime and he had been edge to represent me and he didn't want to do it but the judge told him to do it and so my way of thinking was come\nOn let me be you'll coach and let me bring you to victory still you bringing me to victory let me try to show you who I really am as a person don't look at me for my race look at me for an individual to get to know me and then\nHoped that once you got to know me as ... as a person he was saying you know what he's ... he's a\nPerson that I can work for a person that I Would give them all four and I really felt that all I could win them over and when I saw rocky you know a friend said to myself this is your dream this is what I had imagined that monitoring it would do he when my freedom and we will\nUp some steps somewhere\nAnd we will do our hands open victory and say hey you for the good fight and we want and and so it just brought back a uh some bad memories when I've seen it and then I seen that it wasn't going to work out that way and\nYou can't I Can't even imagine to tell you how it feel known that\nBefore you even go to court you already been George already been found guilty the only sane
