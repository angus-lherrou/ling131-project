P. B. radio you\nFrom Georgia Public broadcasting this is on second thought on Virginia Prescott a year ago this week the New York times were first reported allegations against Harvey Weinstein opening the floodgates for similar accusations of sexual harassment and assault against powerful men and immediate some government and other industries\nMillions of people globally went public with their experiences using the hash tag me to opening up conversations between friends and colleagues and neighbors\nSo what are we now how do we talk about sexual assault and how are we teaching our kids about a topic that has become an avoidable with us is Sally shepherd if the cottage in Athens and you Ga Ga psychology professor I shut and that's where\nI wanted to pick up on something you said that when you speak to people sometimes they called the hotline and they haven't quite wrapped their heads around the experience that it was sexual assault do you think we have a shared understanding of what sexual assault even is\nNo um I Do not think that we do it's interesting that um I was speaking to someone the other day and we were talking about the the low like what is the criminal charges sexual assault what would that entail and how that would be could be vastly\nDifferent than what the human experience\nThe law like what is the criminal charges sexual assault what would that entail and how that would be could be vastly different than what the human experiences a when their body has been violated by another\nAt last week's hearings and the Senate Judiciary committee took measures not come off as callous as it was accused as during the Nineteen Ninety One hearings have now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accused of sexual harassment by any to hell [noise]\nDo you think that the conversation has changed significantly since Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill was named out to be um in fact she was cold some sort of sexual deviant\nHad the conversation has changed I feel like it has in the field I'm I feel like I'm In the past we used to think of\nPeople who saw other people as as it is like a stranger incident that what happened that you wouldn't exactly notice person\nUm I think now we are talking more about consent\nAnd I think if we choose to teach our young people around us and in our lives about consent and what that means and we are I'm helping them understand appreciation for respect of other people's bodies and not object to find human beings but in fact seeing them as a human so perhaps sex sexual thought would be less likely to occur\nWill so that is a question how we talk about kids how we talk about children not just high school kids not just the kid is going forward to college about sexual assault when should those conversations began\nFeel like they should begin um once it I'm not quite at first but I'm\nLike uh something I've done with my children is when I Would give them a bath when they were very young I Would wash all their body parts and I remember for some reason it's very important for us to teach our kids all the names of their body parts that are even songs about body parts and they'll learn the names\nAnd so as you're washing their body parts and\nAlso as you wash their penis or The Vagina let them know the name of their body parts and then as time of all then once they get to an understanding of what touches are to their body than it is important to have a conversation about touches that are okay and not OK\nAnd who is allowed to touch you in certain places and who is not and then you create a safety plan with him about um what to do if that happens and I feel like starting a conversation like that when the child is young will continue into their young teenage years and older teenage years and probably into young adulthood to then you talk about healthy relationships\nConsent and how to make sure that your priorities are known to a partner um and also how to ask a partner or every step of the way if the action\nAnd how to make sure that your priorities are known to a partner um and also how to ask a partner or every step of the way if the actions going on between you two is consensual is okay with that person\nKnow that a lot of conversations have been coming out of ... among women but certainly man I'm telling stories shared of people that I Know and love very well who are men who have been attacked\nAnd we don't want to diminish that experience at all but it is interesting Georgia law\nIs a rape is when a man a sexually assault a woman and the federal law is not a does not confined to men against women in this case a and also then in metro Atlanta that definition is not used\nBut this is an interesting part of the conversation about sexual assault the idea\nThat it is men\nSexually assaulting women how does that change the conversation here in Georgia\nOh that's a good question um I feel like I Know that I Know that in Clark County we have had a mill perpetrators perpetrate on other men I Know that female are able to rape as well um do the sexual thought might be different than ... our mind may come up with us to water rape is\nUm but I think that is important to ah be open and a compassionate to all survivors of sexual assault because sexual assault is what happens to you so much about what you tell\nI don't know if this is a question for both of you it is about what people tell and sure you've both seen the video of Jeff Flake of being confronted by protesters women who were deeply emotional about their experiences of sexual assault and his English and you know how it changed his mind\nWe hear about the numbers of sexual assault but how often do we actually get confronted by that experience and how can that be done in a public unhealthy way I'd love to hear from both of you\nYou have felt illness I think that oftentimes sexual assault\nNot reported just based on the reaction that a lot of people receive\n'em and I think that we certainly can see that played out in the media today I'm even Dr Ford in her testimony said initially she was hesitant to disclose because she didn't want to say that she was at a party drinking with boys [laughter]\nUm so I I think that's certainly um the response is something that I'm may or may not\nYou know like boys [noise] um so I I think that's certainly um the response is something that I'm may or may not encourage people to tell it may or may not\nInfluence the way that the investigation goes afterwards um [noise]\nBut certainly public response racing\nIn Virginia I think we need to remember that sexual assault is a very intimate experience it happens to a person yes it is a crime but it is not like breaking into someone's car\nThis is someone's body and even though it is a physical crime to their body involved is way more than just the penis and vagina or anything like that it it it really works of pure a person's soul in their spirit when this happens to them and it's so many levels\nIn so many levels of healing and it really obscene it affects a survivors for the rest of their life in different ways\nTo it is a crime that often goes unreported Sally I'm Wondering if you when people come into your center or Collier center and say that they have survived a sexual assault do you encourage them to tell their story\nAt the cottage we believe that uh we offer survivors options as to what to do with what has happened to them [noise] um we are an empowerment based agency and so we hope to\nEmpower the clients who reach out to us by letting them know what services are available to them and absolutely that is reporting to law enforcement and if they choose to do that then we will be with them through that process and we will help point them in the right direction as to what jurisdiction they may need to uh to contact the mood that process moving forward\nAnd then we also follow up with therapy for the ... as well because I feel like therapy um is probably just as important as reporting to law enforcement as well but we truly let the survivor and make their own choice\nConversation but thank you for eliminating some of it today a social worker\nSally separate executive director of the cottage sets a sexual assault in children's advocacy center in Athens thank you Sally so much that was my pleasure thank you and I met her she is the
