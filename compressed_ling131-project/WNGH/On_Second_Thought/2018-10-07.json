Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and John Randall director of the year in town so\n[laughter] what you thought process when you look at a script and decide to do it in the case of playing on every no it's not the gods money so one of the personal considerations you apply to the decision\n... shall we start with Bill let's start with Julie [laughter]\nWell ah for me it was I'm Alexandra is just the mere mention of our name and then the mere mention of bill are wins name and I would have come and read you know Goodnight Moon [noise]\nWith those two [laughter] and I didn't realize I got I got Rand up to the sadness is that we we've completed the gig\nIn just a few short hours I Would like to come to her so every day at the Scripps I'll hold you to it [laughter] do\nYou do and when you look\nAt our\nIt speaks\nEven as you're going on sometimes you don't even get it\nAnd when you look at our church gripped\nIt speaks to even as you're going on sometimes you don't even get it yet I'm quite sure what's happening here but you do get a sense of a wood outlined in polls this line and I get an excitement out of the I don't even know what's happening yet but I get a certain excitement sometimes you get the prescription terms you don't [noise]\nI like his his play ever been produced no this is the first time I get to hear it read so glorious lay out loud so this is the world's premier production will be many\nIn the play the husband and wife referred to each other is bill and Jenny but in the cast of characters in your script they referred to as a wife be the husband what was your thought process there\nOh well in writing they seem sort of iconic in terms of\nThe kinds of\nCharacters that might inhabit a very long relationship so it's a envy All right so in your play a says it's too late for me not to be fifty out loud you know what I mean me doesn't want to know what she means can you talk all of a little bit about that moment Alex\nWhy choose me to talk [laughter] idea wasn't turning fifty wavy line because I'm so we're not near as now if I didn't\nQuite a while for someone so young that you'll have somebody inside his daughter and I if I die [laughter] you know and I've I've\nReally have been forty one and not for that many years I I've just managed to be forty one just for a few years Julie window when say out loud what age you or is it verboten in

[noise] uh I'm thirty nine [laughter] I have this year fifty fifty so I've had this exact I mean that's what reading this it was just so funny that thing when that a A R P card comes\nNext but is there is a serious life altering decision made in this play but the plays also accommodate clearly so Alex would you say finding the humor in situations is something that comes naturally to you\nFirst I suffer then I laugh [laughter] pretty much that's how it's\nFirst I suffer then I laugh [laughter] pretty much that's how it's reflected in my writing ... watch special\nAbout writing a short play and for that matter about acting in a short play and directing a short play\nFor me anyway as a director the the\nYou have to just get right to the heart of what these characters need and and try to figure that out immediately um there's no there's no breathing room there's no time to to spend developing character and the best way to find is through exactly what they need\nObviously in this play ah the fade Jenny she needs for freedom she needs to live again\nAnd be is doing everything you can do hold on\nHold on to what he thinks is actually going to be the rest of his life\nAnd what I think what's great about this performance is that it's a real conversation so natural conversation painful as it is and it comes out of the mundane like the revolution happens usually over the kitchen table and a cup of coffee [noise]\nAnd also that idea of that if you come clean about something like that little lie at those couple of years that she was shaving off with all those people it's sort of made her whole existence a bit of a lie so it's like if you got honest about that small thing\nThan it was impossible to be dishonest about anything else [noise] ...\nYeah I haven't even seen that encourage [laughter] just to try to read the paper I can [laughter] you know but what was grand about this experience who's the ... version\nOf the whole process it usually takes place over some weeks now and so John just toughened us up the first time we read it through a couple of lines loves but [laughter]\nNot looking back to you and I realized oh we were in a kind of a with full G O o K I guess we're saying goodbye and then John and Alex toughened up in the yeah various takes note that there were that many but uh so that it's it's an active\nFight to get what you want how scary\nIs it as a writer to reveal what could be interpreted as a personal thing about you\nKnow certainly being honest about where one is in one's life you know is [noise]\nIt's risky but if you don't take that risk you're really not you know contributing\nWell certainly being honest about where one is in one's life you know it's [noise]\nIt's risky but if you don't take that risk you're really not you know contributing as a writer I don't think\nIt's great to hear all my fears you know acted out fears concerns and also a lot of my friends are going through stuff like that not mean of course and I feel for their the humanity of the struggle that they're making this transition as I Am into honest\nOlder adults would\nI like that you call them a and B the universality of it it's like when you're really young and like when you have a child you always think that your child is maybe the you're the only person who's ever out of jobs the older that you get the more you're like oh we're just All right here\nAt the community pool waiting to jump off the diving board we're all in line by each other I mean take your number yeah\nWhere it's all a very similar and I mean wild things are might be a cliche of this woman saying hey I got to make a change because I've still got life to live and I need to live it honestly I didn't\nMake the the the whole play ... make a whole plan going to make all
