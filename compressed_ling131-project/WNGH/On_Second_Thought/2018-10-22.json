podcast for this Spelman College museum of art Floyd Hall hillside\nGood morning so glad to have you had both here the Kevin I'm going to start with you how has the high museum of art audience changed in recent years\n[noise] um it's strange or rather dramatically and this has really been a an initiative of ours in recent years a led by the museum's director him suffer a since his arrival unfold\nAnd this has really been a an initiative of ours in recent years a led by the museum's director in Suffolk since his arrival in fall of of twenty Fifteen\nUm to a redirect the museums attention and resources um two are representing the diversity that is uh Atlanta that is um our state\nAnd um there have been great strides in in that regard uh in terms of a A R audience and who is coming to the museum\nAnd reflecting um uh people of color certainly a that correspond to the demographics of the city of Atlanta I'm even more so whereas before the high was perhaps how to an audience of somewhere around Fifteen Percent\nOr people of color visiting a we're now forty five fifty percent which uh certainly is much more in line with that were the city of Atlanta is that uh fifty one percent\nMinority majority a representation and that's really due to a war we have shifted our programming where we have underscored what we have been doing and in previous years in terms of making inroads into the opening the collections and exhibitions to represent the greater diversity\nAnd let it that find ransacked ... had to ask that museum director speaking to NPR about how they pull that off three times the amount of diverse audience when he started at\nOur staff got together and they did a remarkable job of staying you know what your voice the institution and they came back and said you were a southern institution we're very proud of that there should be more southern hospitality in terms of the way we engage with people\nJust your perhaps the more humility about the way we're talking about ourselves and with individuals that are out there and ultimately we came up with the tagline called here for you that we just want to put it out there that everything that we do is really intended to be audience focused\nHad high diversified its destiny pull the ad campaign as multilingual it's like trying to get locals and the dealer you got and joined when the ... collection what's happening so that polling works on ... out of debt collection how changing not physical space chains expanse of somebody who is that\nIt's it it was certainly a train that was long overdue for for multiple reasons and and certainly one of the leading reasons of courses that to to better represent um what's the museum has been doing in the Thirteen years since it's the last three insulation the collection in two thousand five and\nTo to better represent 'em what to the museum has been doing in the Thirteen years since it's the last three insulation collection and two thousand five\nAnd what the museum has been doing in terms of the the territorial program\nHas been one to really show leadership I'm In acquiring those uh works um by artist of color acquiring works um by a artist of a a different genders\nAnd having a ... a greater representation there so that it it was in in many ways long overdue and what we had to do in terms of\nOur task was reflect that in the re installation\nAnd ... uh where the collections were and what we're presenting was a you know where the museum was in the past and\nSo along with everything else that the museum has been doing ... this was a logical next step for us to take 'em now was very much a multi year efforts and multi prong effort in terms of\nIt's not simply one department doing something but it was a complete re installation of the building from top to bottom and sound like an example of how it would look well one of the things I'm I'm I'm especially proud of is what we were able to do\nBy changing the physical location of certain collections and also changing the intellectual exchange between those collections\nAnd I think it's perhaps most evident if you go to\nWhat is our top floor skyway level of the a stent wing which is a Richard my building and the wheel and ... which is one of the rings of piano pavilions and you see uh the immediate relationship between aspects of our modern and contemporary collection\nAnd our folk and self taught collections and are African art collections\nAnd I think this is this is borne out of a realization that we we talked about\nNot only how do we give 'em credit prominence two aspects were collection which are quite important uh certainly uh all three of those collections as as well as others they have important key works um that are unique to the high\nUh that uh visitors here in Atlanta or visitors coming to Atlanta would want to see but um there there were works of contemporary art or their works of modern art and they all are regardless of\nWhether they were made in Africa or whether they were made in Georgia or whether they were made ... anywhere in the world\nAnd I think it was important for us to underscore that relationship and certainly this is something that some of her sister institutions have been doing and I think it gave us a ...\nAnd for us to underscore that relationship and I'm certainly this is something that uh some of her sister institutions have been doing and I think uh gave us a chance to say for example in our fault and a self taught to lecture and\nBe able to present or some of the the gifts from the ... foundation from the other three are within the context of modern and contemporary art so there's that you can walk into those calories in the works by Jordan don't you can walk into\nInto a the folk and self taught collections in the works of African or you can see African or in the fall and self taught in terms of creating the connections in terms of the legacy of that work um and that was a very deliberate uh and very carefully considered decision lemon ...\nPie I'm for full disclosure my in laws are heavily involved in the ... foundation and add been advocating for ... for many many decades have kept trying to make that clear that you've been to that the new museum or that when you look\nI have yes so what do you know when you're walking you know I think there's always this overarching narrative around um\nThe museum and where it fits within Atlanta's culture community and so now you mentioned the skyway area there I think that it's it's interesting to be able to go to um to work in that space and see\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa oh\nI was asked me for music to have fish are still in the late\n\nPort for TB comes from you our listeners\nOur reporters have been

for the twenty Eighteen National Book award I spoke with her when the book first came out and asked her what she find so intriguing about the state she now calls home I Am\nSo ambivalent about Florida so I both absolutely adore it I go for a run every single morning out in the primary and I see the natural world and I can you know they're always snakes ... foot and amazing birds that I Wish that I could identify sort of landing in the trees around me it's a very\nStunning and beautiful and there's a poor of sunshine of everything but there is at its heart is very central strangeness it's a very

[noise]\nUh it's it's a gift and the thing that I was looking at when I was trying to figure out how to put up this story collection together um\nWas what how do I look at Florida itself um ... what do I think of the the name Florida what what does it\nMean to me in it to me it means pervasive ongoing dread covered in sunlight doing golden beautiful studying ... so the lord a\nTourist board is not going to make you at spokesperson well perhaps\nSay well if they want to make Florida even weirder than it is yes\nThere is a sense of danger underfoot especially in places where humans need the natural world and it's like a snake coiled in the bath tub and an alligator not far from the dog Penn is sinkhole at the edge of the suburb I feel like that to you that you could just fly into some other realm\nIt does feel like that to me but it also feels like that in terms of being a parent in today's world two small children right I mean I feel like\nJust the act of having a child in the world as an act of danger right because suddenly you have this heart taken out of your chest and made manifest in the world and you can't control the world around the your your child so [noise]\nUm I Do I Do think that that's the way I feel about the state but it's also the way I feel about you know being a a human in this\nCurrent environment um that we happen to be in right now\nBut the danger of children is it seems like part of the game here there's\nA story dogs go walls that's about a pair of younger sisters their mother all adults abandon them on the island and at first you know it's fun there's a big sister making up stories about princesses that essentially they're eating chap stick to survive\nYou our parents but you're also a big star was that your role with your little sister kind of keeping or going this story did\nCome out of a moment of my life and my sister was having a hard time and I kept thinking how I could protect her I mean she is\nYou know she's an adult now she's in her mid thirties she's a two time Olympic athlete she's fine she doesn't need me to protect her [noise] but it's also something that I've been thinking about a lot in about the world in general is um how do we take care\nOlympic athlete she's fine she doesn't need me to protect her\nBut it is also something that I've been thinking about a lot in about the world in general is um how do we take care of the most vulnerable among us I mean we have to take care of the vulnerable people in our world\nHow do we do so um how do we make sure everybody is a is able to survive it how do we do these things so that the defense of peril comes from um a larger almost existential idea a in that story\nWell her answer to vulnerability is fantasy and and I can't help but think of Florida as Disney Princess land it did you have those kinds of fantasies did you make up those kind of story when you were a kid\n[noise] no I never liked the princess I've always hated the whole narrative of the prince of the narrative of the princes is it um your life basically ends as soon as you find love right I mean it's almost as though oh woman only exists in order to be an object of love or addicted to have to have a love story\nWhen in reality I mean I have an older brother and I saw that he wasn't fed these narratives um he was fed the narrative that you go out and you have your adventure in your life has your adventure and I resented the idea that my life it and as soon as I fell in love\nSo I um I actually truly dislike a lot of the narrative that we are force fed and that we actually take in a with them you know our our milk with the media\nUm all around us and I I think one of the things that this question does is that it poses a lot of these these narratives these narratives about what it means to be a mother and and to to seize that space what it means to be domestic were domesticated what it means to sort of resist the wild but while also tempting the wild and\nUm you know I I hate the cowboy Mitt those I hate princesses I you know I hate the things that we are told\n'em that that our our our skeletons of our narratives and as we all know narrative is the most important thing if you control the narrative you control everything around\nYou reminding me of an appearance that I saw view from twenty sixteen this is on the Charlie Rose show I'm Charlie Rose we know what has happened to him sense but I just want to play it because that's pointed to something that you're talking about\nHad so much ... and I think that's in myself and I say that's an all out of my friends to oh one oh and you know Rachel\nIt's not so much that I\nAnd I think that's in myself and I say this and all of my friends one holding him rage\nAnd it's not so much that I was an unusual in my age is that women are not necessarily allowed access open access to our our fury on so wait stop yes women are not necessarily for access to their fury ... come up with\nA bit of a part of their lord ... yeah okay I can say about the gas [laughter] I'm also he talked about hoping um um but I Would like to say I I have felt\nGuilty about this interaction the whole time I was playing nice um and I was being a nice guess and I could have just said\nWomen have so much to be angry about I mean when we make Seventy five cents on the man's dollar and less for women of color when we have to fight every day for bodily autonomy when we have lack of representatives in politics and business on the Supreme Court I mean everything everything we have everything to be angry about\nAnd yet I failed field Alterman is by not saying these things to Charlie Rose I might not\nStanding up for women at that moment so I'm I feel very embezzling hearing that clip well you just got to make it up right I did a Charlie Rose audience\nBut being in that position a woman's blaming female rage to Charlie Rose when you heard about the accusations against him did you have any perspective on the way that he understood or maybe thought about women no\nBecause he was kind to me right he was being very nice he did he did interrupt me you know and uh I think I Am more used to that than a man would be um [noise]", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "22"}
