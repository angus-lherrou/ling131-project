not think of the south as the cradle of multiculturalism\nBut we are getting that a second thought on tomorrow's show in the mid twentieth century influential white and black writers and intellectuals argued against integration they advocated for separate cultural and creative spaces coexist thing unparalleled\nTracks so separate but equal\nWhat do you say what did integration mean for black and white culture and did fears that black music and food and slang would be mixed or eroded or co-opted or ruin white culture that\nCome true chime in on Facebook or Twitter or call us at four zero four or five hundred nine four five seven and joined us lives tomorrow at nine\nBut for now we turn to the south and decades after integration a place of unbearable tensions as Taylor Bruce writes in his introduction to American South it's the latest field guide in the wild Sam American road trip series Taylor's creator an editor of the series and joins us now from Austin hello\nHi Hi I'm not your typical field guide very designed we don't get started ratings and photographs of places you must see but instead we get old news clips\nTypical field guide very designed we don't get started rating photographs of places you might see but instead we get old news clippings and your story ... recommendations for travelers tell me a little bit about that your travel writer for eight years before this guide what what was the inspiration\n[noise] so uh the inspiration really was to create a book that really tells you where you are you know I mean who can tell you the kind of where you land on the map it doesn't really give you the depth of context and\nSo we just we thought there was a a need for for guides that that told the story of a place and so I was living in a five hundred square foot apartment in New York City and I just finished an MSA and infection riding and\nJust had this idea and and gathered some friends up in Nashville, Tennessee and a a good friend in Atlanta who is a designer and\nYou know six months later we had a book about Nashville and that was that was six years ago and we're on our thirteenth folk now\nWait a defining the American south and you write in your introduction oppression and guilt that then nice beauty and sorrow because this is my home and these are my people I cannot escape to these two story\nAnd like two trees wrapped together on my family farms like what are these two story [noise]\nKnow the south [noise] or you know there's a need to discuss it on your show um is a complicated place um\nIs is dark and light as I say in the intro and\nThe the two stories are you know they're sort of an escape of all if you just you know typical travel guide for example is there's going to mostly tell one story which is you know this great restaurant and this beautiful beach and and that type of experience and\nWe just feel that to have a full experience and sort of a complete picture of humanity you have to tell the whole story and that includes the the darker Jews um and so all of our books in the American south for sure a kind of takes that had on an doesn't shy away from from telling those stories and\nAnd letting other people tell their stories we sort of see ourselves as kind of the other congregating force that brings other voices into the into the book and then just sort of less the stories about themselves\nAnd you write about coming across the story in particular that revealed kind of darker trees here there in Austin and read something in the New York times about your hometown Grange Georgia what was that\nYeah I grew up uh you know just about an hour south of Atlanta and ... and I'm an amazing town lovely ... and I mean this is\nGeorgia what was that yeah I grew up uh you know just about an hour south of Atlanta and ... and\nI'm an amazing town lovely ... and I mean this is you know January twenty Seventeen I pick up the newspaper and on the front page blow uh blow the full there was a headline white police chief apologizes for Nineteen forty southern lynching\nAnd it's the story of a young man a teenage black a black teenager who was accused of attacking a white woman and a mob of white men took him from the jail and drove them eight miles outside of town and killed him\nAnd I never I never heard that story the first I read of it was that morning in the newspaper um and that\nThe story itself was a shocking truth but to realize that I had you know I've grown up for Eighteen years in this town and I'd never heard this story and I'm you know my parents had never heard this story and I would wages they most of the people I Know it never heard this story\nIt it said a lot to me about I'm sort of the south and um you know that the light of truth to sort of not shown everywhere um that's up to be wills writes that the only way to right wrongs as the turn the light of truth upon them and so [noise]\nYou know that that experience I'm just you know it really sort of said and and sort of I'm inspired me to just kind of move right into my you know my my home place and then to to do this book ...\nInside the place we don't often see that you sometimes have to get away\nAnd in the beginning of the book there are different points in southern history of which of course is that rich in vast history beginning states dean Thirteen ... deli on\nA constantly on as we say here in Atlanta and floors and nickel waters in Florida but it's really interesting other dates of course the ... the civil war\nBut then you know we have things like roots the mini series airs on ABC we call open steam studios in Muscle Shoals why these choices what makes banned the markers of southern history\n[noise] you know our books are small if if if a if you're holding your hand you can put in your back pocket it's a hundred and forty pages and\nWe uh weird it's not an exhaustive a story of the south\nBut but our hope is that we will sort of sprinkle on every page um these sort of beautiful in true stories about the region um but just the spark people's curiosity to to discover and learn more and to experience you know to to go to Muscle Shoals\nOr is about the region and um but just the spark people's curiosity to to discover and learn more and to experience you know to to go to Muscle Shoals and sort of you know have a have a have a moment of understanding what happened in FAME Studios in order to go into Georgia coast in and say the shrimp boats in the area and\nAre we we're not going to sort of give you a hundred restaurants to to eat out it's more of hey there's this one restaurant in Atlanta busy be cafe like if you go there I'm you're going to experience something real about the city um and and\nAnd the special um and so that that's kind of our approach 'em and you know our timelines on one page and so obviously you can't capture the history of the south you can't have to capture the history of anywhere on on a single page so\nThat it is interesting to do it you know through the books and the food and at the literature and even the television shows and in some way\nI'm speaking with the writer editor and the grains native Taylor ... he's the curator of the wild sand field guide which recently published a field guide to the American south including FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Alabama and this is one of the song I came from there\nYeah\nI mean Franklin of course are Korea transformed in Muscle Shoals\nAnything have transformed in this house and this guide the wild Sam died sends readers on his two week trip called the southern ... from Washington DC to New Orleans and in Georgia you suggest people stop in Atlanta specifically the due for highway what makes this the destination\nYou know it was really tough to figure out what is one thing that people should experience in Atlanta and we landed on the highway you know if you're unfamiliar a ten mile stretch of global cuisine and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Second Thought",
