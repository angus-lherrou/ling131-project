thinking about our days at the Miami Herald where it was like above the fold top story you know right but that is not what this one eight is what is it\nOne a stands for the first amendment which we basically consider to be\nThe central rules of the road for how we engage with one another in a democracy you know free speech free press freedom of worship and then freedom to demand change from the government\nIt's basically the government saying that it is binding its own hands from preventing us from doing that so since the first amendment kind of deals with the way that we engage with one another we thought that would be a good name to encompass these debates about who we are as a country but also\nFrom my time at the Miami Herald which called its front page page one at a\nThose are the kinds of stories that were going after those front page stories that either everyone's talking about but would like to talk about more deeply or stories that aren't like the big story of the day but they say something about who we are they reflect this back to ourselves and there were talking about ...\nYou mentioned free speech and in this day and age it does seem to be a many people would say under attack in many ways whether it is ballplayers taking a knee during the national anthem or whether it's conservative speakers who feel like they are being blocked from college campuses\nAnd I'm Wondering what have you been learning about the first amendment and free speech\nI think free speech is actually doing pretty well these days and part of that is because\nTechnology makes it so much harder to absolutely crack down on what someone can or cannot say I mean the first amendment does not prevents say Facebook from setting rules on who can speak where it deals with government not with private enterprise so I feel like a lot of people are actually learning what the law does and does\nIf Facebook from setting rules on who can speak where it deals with government not with private

this is the only home his kids have ever know listening to everything which is why the scene that our backs hurts so much it's one of the thousands the farms pecan trees laid low by hurricane Michael and this one was a real money make\nOne of the oldest friday actually called the money because actually called the money like\nHere's the biggest one great this already it's ripped up tap root is encased in red clay and maybe Thirty years away pecans are piled like gravel and address dream dead between enormous tree trunks then that could still be gathered by hand if only someone would do the work\nI had a crew Monday in that now don't have a cruise ship our I paint them Tony fascinating students' day\nThat's twenty five cents a pound and that works out to about twenty five dollars a day and an average year these nuts would have been headed to China not this year because of the weather the because of the U.S China a trade war now\nSo I don't know that we can supply of what\nWe're still money to be made in a group of far younger trees though it didn't escape\nSalmon\nThousands of these trees must be cut down to fill Bolger says the younger trees are the long term future of the final plantation but in the short term\nYet those lean years coming ahead of us and we'll we'll work around them\nWhich Bolger says that means re planning intending and waiting for decades then he's hopeful he'll seat the pine pecan plantation thick with money makers again for NPR News I'm grant Blankenship in Pretoria Georgia\nAnd the ... the destruction that grant reported on prompted governor deal to call lawmakers back to Atlanta\nYou done this once before ... congressional district cannot within twenty and that and then I get this has been ... political ... for some perspective on the assembly ... under the cold down next month bill thank you so much for being here in Virginia well let's start with the basics one is a special\nUm under a Georgia statutes or a governor is a permitted\nTo call the legislature back into session a at a different time of the year than the regular ... they go from January ah ah to usually late march early April it depends on how many times they stopped the car\nSo that they have a forty days and you will session\nA required by law but then the governor if he feels there is a pressing need can call it additional\nForty days annual session a required by law but then the governor if he feels there is a a pressing need can call it additional a meeting of the legislature he has to do in his call\nTell the people at the state to legislate tours what he wants on the agenda for that special session\nHe so he's done that in this case he wants to look at hurricane or a damage and how to pay for it he wants to look at a tax break for a jet fuel a and he may have one or two other items that he'll address I think he wants to get some judicial confirmations\nHe has a little leeway in deciding on a couple of additional items but he also has to say we think will go a week we might go little our mind\nAnd state lawmakers and about Seventeen thousand Downey there many have I think ...\nPractical barrier to calling a special session simply how extraordinary is that\nUm it happens it regularly but it but it has happened on a number of occasions in the last few decades um\nAnd this one ... the reason for the course is that there has been at least a hundred million dollars worth of damage with the state and the federal government are going to have to deal with\nUm hurricane Michael was obviously incredibly devastating to a farmer's to rural Georgia communities as well and he doesn't want to wait\nTo start figuring out how to pay for those bills so he's bringing a legislature together first and foremost to address the cost and how to deal with them\nAnd mating thirty five thousand property related insurance claims have insurance losses estimate the tunnel and two hundred and fifty million that's according to the joint to insurance commissioner of course insurance from kissing on federal funding anything even cover in charge of crops kill him by meeting earlier when does that mean the money gets out\nEarlier yeah I mean eventually most of this will be paid for by federal relief dollars but in the meantime the governor and his people say look we got to start paying bills now we've got to pay for maintenance crews were going to do clean up and a lot of these cases\nWe've got a staff people in government staffs who are working many overtime hours um and he he wants to find a way to pay for this stuff now so the checks can start flowing federal aid will reimburse a lot of this later on\nDidn't take it to farmers in southwestern to after hurricane micro here's what or when ...\nStart flowing federal aid will reimburse a lot of this later on\nWe did speak to farmers in southwest Georgia after hurricane Michael here's what Irwin tiny ... Randy Hudson pop\nWill tell you the last year we lost over a thousand crazed are long\nAnd at that time I walked across orchards and uh and I said look I don't know about this but then I went back and planted those spots in and and\nYou know my grandchildren one day to harvest pecans and courses now I'm Out here today what probably at least another thousand trees on the ground and just the average guy has got just lay on power on top of you know\nIt's just tragic ... imagine a farmer looking out over there man like that and farmers and now there's been some pressure on can certainly suffering buddies a special session the only way this taken happening as governor deal have any special powers he can exercise some urgency finding the way bad president faint sample could use an executive order well I\nI think one of the most important thing is that a governor can do is to make a special pleading with it in fact the federal authorities in this case with the president of the United states\n[noise] [noise] even in summer by ten o'clock in the evening the sun is well down in the stars are out and the music has out as well [noise]\nI'm ... joined me for night cap tonight at ... company for here in the evening\n\nSupport for G.

create the comic nastier\nWell hello [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] well mostly it there was there was a a few things I'm actually inspired me one of them I'm I'm a big fan of that show I'm French Iran's renowned British are kind of like most people have seen it or not they're not American right on it [laughter] and um\nIt I mean I loved it when it was running and then ... and early ... thousands of this stuff\nUp and when I start watching reruns of it I noticed something I'm most people are of white ethnic background and the show and there's it it's a show that it said in New York and that seem a little unrealistic to me\nIt was a ... and people seem like I'm white people so I was like this is not realistic this is not something that is currently going on in the stuff I'm\nDoing a ... a little research has like New York has most\nUm variety of accents you can find and you don't have to go that far here in Georgia you find people from\nAll over the world bank Clark's in the midst of Orange County and a country\nYes so um yeah that that was part of the of the inspiration there was like well I'm I'm an immigrant myself I have an accent of my own so why not explore that so yeah that was the most part of it\nSo you went to the Web getting funding for a TV show or something is not easy certainly he did you catch this idea that production company first or or television companies before going the independent route no\nYou just went straight to the Web\nYes um well this is what happens um um I actually a gun\nYou just went straight to the Web yes um well this is what happens um\nUm I actually got in contact with a couple of studios and I pitched idea and it actually happen what you normally hear it was like oh it's a fantastic idea\nBut ... we are kind of not interest right now [laughter] so um I just decided well OK if they don't want to do it for us then\nI'll do it myself and I ... I got all the time I was I'm getting together with a group or on a on a ... group and um it was a about filming and we decided hey you know we have people here we can do it I mean maybe\nWe need to learn a few things along the way it but we can do it ourselves so that's one\nSo we had read and what's your character like ... I Love\nHer um she's she actually came from Kenya to America to go during ... I'm nursing school\nAnd she's very strong will it's just hard work and she loves hard she loves her friends she loves helping them going through any struggles or problems they have usually when people have any problems they run to the library 'cause\nShe can talk ... talk I'm with them through it or you know help them and she just loves really hard so\nYou're from Nigeria that you play a woman who's Kenya and yes and is there a do you put on a Kenyan accent\nI'm I typically use my Nigerian accent but some words I changed a little bits of sound more Kenyan I don't know I Can't really explain it like um like their accents are very similar but then there's some things you say like in jail and say that a Kenyan typically once said or what saved differently\nWell I'm asking because the whole theory of the show with accents read and write and that and I think many people who are unaware of those will just think oh African or right American or ... or Latino or something like that right how 'bout for you what's your character\nPlay a character his name as a an war he's off from the middle east specifically from Lebanon and I love my parents are because they're kind of like\nResonates with myself or he comes to this country of you know he's new to the whole world and he's always like ridiculed about where he's from the whole Middle Eastern stereotyped\nBut uh my character is like a lovable character he ... he loves to have fun he's a he's a ladies' man but he failed at it you have so much conflict but he's just he's\nBut uh my character he's like a lovable character he ... he loves to have fun he's a he's a ladies' man but he fails that it almost conference but he says he's oblivious to everything [laughter]\nBut ah you just saw a real fun guy has parents back home that has a business and just they just help him live in this country comes two and a ... it's like ... the like the show itself gives the whole dynamic of kind of gives you a bird's eye view and how other races are perceived like ... you know we're now just crazy people you know\nWhat we do a lot of stereotypical roles on television you write Asian character typically and lions married or they kept getting black person or or the loud Latino woman so how do you overcome type casting and type\n... it's I guess it if we have if we show more of dynamics if we show more that we can actually do more than just what we're capable of just go to our background like we can also we we could play the main role to play lead role to play Dr lawyers it's just this necessarily have to be just one specific thing because we're so\nStereotyped like for example for like Middle Eastern people were like known for like being a like a engineers or doctor is kind of Indians mhm but ah but there's more we could do you know there's\nEntertainment ... radio there is a magazine is photography and you know there's a lot of other things and that's what the show is trying to do is trying to like open up a broad spectrum from all different races because we have Koreans we have a nice ... started Kenyan\nA British and all that it's just showing a whole different dynamic it opens up every character to a whole different world especially in today's era of how the world is going right now so\nWell and this is interesting writing today that when the action movies Lucy came out of wonder when people were like oh gee female protagonist can sell movie tickets away you know who to target or\nCrazy Rich Asians and Black Panther came out and camp cascades of articles surprise fat minority leads can can carry movies does the industry or the public derive the does the industry or the ... like let's say drive the idea that white male actors they needed to sell them in theory keep his show", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "24"}
