working as a department store elf\nNow he's a remarkably successful author writing for the New Yorker among other publications and observing the indignities and upsides of aging there are a few real joy to middle age he writes in one of his essays from his new book calypso\nFeeling park I can see is that with luck you'll acquire a guest room\nThat's the kind of spin that we've come to know him for and another essay his longtime partner Hugh observes that he always writes about the negatives instead of the positive I asked David Sedaris about that when we spoke during his last trip through Georgia\nI don't know the negative just makes for a better story [laughter] thank you if you and I are having a ... and I said do you remember the time the EU empty dead ashtray on to my lab why do you have to remember that\nWe're we're riding in a car in Normandy and I put my cigarette out they asked the Astros on the dashboard and ash flew into his eye and he ... he picked the whole ashtray out of the dashboard and dumped it in my lap and I was wearing we're getting ready to board off\nA ferry for England and I had ... white pants on and then he emptied the whole strangely forget that\nI'm not going to get that\nSo remembering the ashtray and the parents is more interesting than the drive to Normandy or drive to the ferry when everything was perfect and the clouds were puffy enough they in the sky\nHe ruined all that when he dumped it empty death stray into my lap [laughter] I mean I Would have just written about that with any empty the ashtray in my lap and he ruined it so it became a story about that it became the day\nThat he dumped stash around in my lap does he mind thing the subject of your stories real he usually weights and he wants to read them\nDump stash around in my lap does she mind thing the subject of your stories real he\nUsually weights and he wants to read the book when it's in galleries and he knows that I'm not going to write anything about him like keep them never written what he looks like naked I've never written and sexually anything about him it's all\nCosmetic rarely I mean it when I write about whew I'm just kind of writing about making the life with somebody and so I think anyone in the audience can relate to what you don't have to be gay you know if you're trying to make a life with someone in stain that relationship then you can relate to it\nYou also grow up at a time when people didn't talk to their parents about what they observe for their problems like in the book you write about your mom and her alcoholism and no one in your family called her on at our confronted her\nHer alcoholism eventually died of cancer\nUm but you don't drink right now now did you see yourself in her or her and you\nSure I mean my mother and I were different kinds of drinkers I mean\nI Would drink and then I Would write I mean I had it in my mind that I could only right when I was drinking which I don't know I guess because I started around the same time drinking in writing\nMy mother didn't have any kind of an outlet for it I don't know it was just really hard or drinking seemed a an expression of sorrow me\nUm and that makes me sad thinking about it you know when I wrote the essay I was just oh isn't making any\nBig point I guess I was just saying that a lot of really good people are alcoholics and they just don't have what it takes\nSome reason they don't have what it takes to quit I mean my mother would quit drinking for four days and you know call me up and say tell me about it and and then I Would call her the next night and you know I can tell right away that she was drinking again she just\nDidn't have a [noise] she just didn't have the ... the the\n[noise] I Want to say the strength to quit you know I'm so used to I'm sixty one my mother died when she was sixty two and I've moved so many times in my life\nAnd I would move again tomorrow and\nA ten years from now hopefully I Would feel free to move again\nAnd I would move again tomorrow and a ten years from now hopefully I Would feel free to move again and you know I've learned or or I have a history of\nChanging things myself now and my mother didn't and so I think it was unfathomable for her that she could leave my father that she could quit drinking that she could start over again\nI think sixty two felt very very old to her and also because she didn't move around march or she was a very heavy smoker that\nYou know I remember when mine came to visit me in Chicago once and we're taking the al ... and I went up the wrong staircase\nAnd and it was a lot of stairs from my mother and she just barely made it to the top and then to say oh we have to go down and we have to cross the street we have to go upstairs [laughter] so bad about it and I think\nSixty two was old to her in a way that is not to a healthier person or a sober person yeah\nAnd do you view almost at that age are there things that you think that you can't shake about it you know dying at her age or\nI always thought it was going to die when I'm sixty two and so I read did my wheels\nAnd ... all I'm going to say as a lot of people are going to be really really happy I die [laughter]\nI really it was a lot of fun it was fun to pick people who would say who's the or people who just wouldn't they would say why do they do that they're going to be

have my family was a child I noticed other people\nYou know they would eat dinner and then they would go to their rooms or go watch TV or something and my dad would leave the table the second he finished eating and the rest of us would sit around for hours and hours and hours every night like in high school you wouldn't have a boyfriend or girlfriend's\nIt wouldn't you wouldn't need not be

met David Sedaris as a young man working as a department store elf now he's a remarkably successful author writing for the New Yorker among other publications and observing the indignities and upsides of aging\nThere are a few real joys to middle age he writes in one of his essays from his new book calypso feeling park I can see is that with luck you'll acquire a guest room\nThat's the kind of spin that we've come to know him for and another essay his longtime partner Hugh observes that he always writes about the negative instead of the positive I asked David Sedaris about that when we spoke during his last trip through Georgia\nI don't know the negative just makes for a better story [laughter] thank you if you and I are having ... and I said do you remember that time the you empty that ashtray on to my lab why do you have to remember that\nWe're we're riding in a car in Normandy and I put my cigarette out they asked the Astros on the dashboard and ash flew into his eye and he ... he picked the whole ashtray out of the dashboard and dumped it in my lap and I was wearing we're getting ready to board off\nA ferry for England and I had ... white pants on and then he embodied the whole strangely going to forget that\nI'm not going to forget that\nSo remembering the ashtray and the parents is more interesting than the drive to Normandy or drive to the ferry when everything was perfect and the clouds were puffy enough then this guy\nHe ruined all that when he dumped it empty the ashtray and in my life I mean I Would have just written about that but then he him through the ashtray in my lap and he ruined it so it became a story about that it became the day\nThat he dumped their shopping around in my lap does he mind thing the subject of your stories real he usually weights and he wants to read the book when it's in galleries but he knows that I'm not going to write anything about\nThe subject of your stories real he usually weights and he wants to read the book when it's in galleries but he knows that I'm not going to write anything about him my keep them never written what he looks like naked I've never written a sexually anything about him it's all\nCosmetic rarely I mean it when I write about whew I'm just kind of writing about making the life with somebody and so I think anyone in the audience can relate to what you don't have to be gay you know if you're trying to make a life with someone and stain that relationship then you can relate to it\nYou also grow up at a time when people didn't talk to their parents about what they observe for their problems like in the book you write about your mom and her alcoholism and no one in your family called her on and are confronted her\nHer alcoholism eventually died of cancer\nYou don't drink right now now did you see yourself in her or her and you\nSure I mean my mother and I were different kinds of drinkers I mean\nI Would drink and then I Would write I mean I had it in my mind that I could only right when I was drinking which I don't know I guess because I started it around the same time drinking in writing\nMy mother didn't have any kind of an outlet for it I don't know it was just really or or drinking seemed a an expression of sorrow me\nUm and that makes me sad thinking about it you know when I wrote the essay I was just oh isn't making any\nBig point I guess I Would just saying that a lot of really good people are alcoholics and they just don't have what it takes\nSome reason they don't have what it takes to quit I mean my mother would quit drinking for four days and you know call me up and say tell me about it and and then I Would call her the next night and you know I could tell right away that she was drinking again she just\nDidn't have a [noise] she just didn't have the ... the the\n[noise] I Want to say the strength to quit you know I'm so used to I'm sixty one my mother died when she was sixty two and I've moved so many times in my life\nAnd I would move again tomorrow and\nA ten years from now hopefully I Would feel free to move again\nAnd you know I've learned\nThe uh ten years from now hopefully I Would feel free to move again and\nYou know I've learned or or I have a history\nOf changing things myself now and my mother didn't and so I think it was unfounded move for her that she could leave my father that she could quit drinking that she could start over again\nI think sixty two felt very very old to her and also because she didn't move around much uh she was a very heavy smoker that\nYou know I remember when mine came to visit me in Chicago once and we're taking the L and I went up the wrong\nStaircase and and it was a lot of stairs from my mother and she just barely made it to the top and then to say oh we have to go down and we have to cross the street we have to go upstairs [laughter] so bad about it and I think\nSixty two was old to her in a way that is not to a healthier person or sober person yeah\nAnd do you view almost at that age are there things that you think of that you can't shake about it you know dying at her age or\nI always thought it was going to die when I'm sixty two and so I did my will\nAnd I'm ... I'm going to say is a lot of people are going to be really really\nHappy guy [laughter] I really it was a lot of fun it was fun to pick people who would say who's the or people who just wouldn't they would say why did he do that they're going to be really surprised when I die a lotta people it's gonna be a beautiful day for a lot of people\nSedaris author of books including theft by finding and most recently calypso I'm Virginia Prescott when we come back to David Sedaris fans really know him\nThere's days are long form conversation day for on second thought\nIn a media sphere dominated by soundbites conversations like this one are possible only with your support\nBecause we are accountable to you not commercials not algorithms is driven by quick kits and click bait but listeners who through the years had loaded with your financial support to create a safe haven for conversations to have time to unfold to reveal ending deeper\nDuring DVDs falls on Dr were reminding you of why we depend on you and this is your opportunity to do your part demand is up to you\nDeeper during GBDs falls on Dr were reminding you of why we depend on you and this is your opportunity to do your part and aren't as up to you accounts most is that we hear from you and here's how you can help you can help\nWith the click and cheap TV dot org or call eight hundred to two to four seven eight ...\nYou're listening to on second thought here on listener supported Georgia Public broadcasting the news coverage the conversations of what we're hearing today the conversation with David there are some the station are relevant in depth entertaining and informative\nAnd your support is absolutely essential to G.
