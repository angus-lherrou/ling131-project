majority\nWell they've got one in about what cases there on the docket secretaries that began on Monday Fred Smith drinker for more on that she's associate professor of law at Emory University ... hello how are you very well seven thousand cases Supreme Court each year how many will it here this year\nSo typically will hear a brown ... cases a so it could be um you know somewhere between Seventy five eighty five cases but it'll be around eighty cases that has been true with some consistency over the past few years\nOf the cases that the Supreme Court last year this year I understand that the majority are decided unanimously or pre teen years unanimously except for the hot button social issues that are likely to break the court down along partisan lines any of these coming up and twenty Nineteen term\nI think one of the cases are types of cases that you're going to hear about it because there's series of that across the country\nIs titled seven employment discrimination\nAnd whether a particular statute when it says that you can't discriminate on the basis of sex whether that includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation\nAnd whether it includes discrimination on the basis of gender identity and gender expression so it's kind of protests there was someone who worked for the Georgia State capital\nAnd when she began working there she identified as a man presented as a man biologically I'm a man and a during the course of her time on the job she transitioned to a\nTo being a woman and that that's when she was fired\nAnd she sued to sex discrimination when I was a man a it was perfectly okay for me to work here but now a woman you fired me but for the fact that I'm presenting as a woman I Would have my job that's the only reason I don't have my job\nAnd in that case actually the eleventh or get an opinion joined by or perhaps even written by a very conservative judge William hire a\nWho was one of the people that\nThat President Trump was considering for the Supreme Court he actually ruled in favor of the plaintiffs the eleventh did in that particular case um and they just simply look that says you can't

that seems like a very clean case when this person present it as a man they can keep their jobs when they present it as a woman they couldn't ah and so that's the case out of Georgia that that people might be interested in\nIs actually shortened Jerry ... Pittsburgh\nIs exclusive fresh air bringing some of the biggest names in American culture and some of the most difficult to pronounce joined\nAnnette Benning is this afternoon at three on ...\n\nFrom Georgia Public broadcasting this is on second thought I'm Virginia Prescott\nAs the FBI investigation of sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continue we're getting some insight on cases on the Supreme Court docket for twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen turn on the line with us from Chicago associate professor of law at Emory Fred Smith\nOr friend both pro and anti abortion rights advocates expect to petition for cases that erode protections for round the wait\nThere are cases pending in lower courts now that restrict funding or methods or access to abortion how likely is it that the court which hear any of those cases that term\nIt's not clear whether it will happen this term but it does seem very likely that it will happen in the next few years what one would expect to happen as the composition of the court to shift and especially with Justice Kennedy no longer on the court\nIs going to be a lot of interest in testing the new limits of roe versus Wade\nA few years ago or there was a five to four opinion women's health\nI'm Out of the state of Texas I'm where there were a lot of restrictions that were placed on a witch doctors could perform abortions and where and ah it would have meant that there were only going to be like cooking\nPlace on a witch doctors could perform abortions and where and ah it would have meant that there are only going to be a ... like I think three or four cities in the state of Texas where someone could obtain an abortion and wear a if someone were in West Texas\nIt would have been nearly impossible for them to obtain and uh and abortion Supreme Court ruled that that particular law violated a roe versus Wade and the right to privacy which includes a under existing precedent the right to an abortion but it was it was a five to four opinion uh and so given that it was a five to four opinion\nWith Justice Kennedy or being in the five one would expect a lot of tests about what the new limits\nAre what are the kind of ice and restrictions on abortion here in Georgia and the house and general\nSuing the state of Georgia a there's a twenty week abortion ban and a twenty four hour waiting period which is an extremely outside of the norm although in Georgia it used to be\nA twenty four weeks and it was moved to twenty weeks which resulted in a some litigation actually outside of the south actually on one of the most restrictive abortion laws in North Dakota which although it's not currently in effect because it's been found to be unconstitutional it's a six week\nA band and that suggests that one of the things that might happen over the next couple of years is the best one of the ways that states might test the law to try to move the number of weeks earlier and earlier and earlier\nI'm such that you kind of get to a place where where women wouldn't meaningfully be able to obtain an abortion in some states so I think that's something certainly to watch\nAnd looking at a tiny Eighteen time there were a big decision on public sector unions that ran for Christian Baker refused to bake a cake for gay wedding on the ground gerrymandering ... pregnancy centers\nAnd it looks like ... twenty Nineteen there may be an attempt to lower the temperature do you think that is a strategy that chief justice John Roberts and the court is taking\nSo it could be lower the temperature is kind of yours for a political capital standpoint the Supreme Court has a limited capital you know if people\nFeel that the court is getting too involved in issues that they belong to a politically accountable bodies um then that would be\nUh for some concern in terms of the court's legitimacy and so I Do think they have to be thoughtful and careful about that\nIf that happened on Friday after the allegations against\nUh for some concern terms of the course legitimacy and so I Do think they have to be thoughtful and careful about that\nThe FBI has until friday to investigate allegations against judge Kavanaugh and plans to vote on friday if he is seated and said credible evidence were presented in the future ten Supreme Court justice be removed or impeached from their
