on base far out paces the popularity of the walking dead it's grounded in dynamics of race and gender and power here with a primer on this history is Sarah Juliet LRO assistant professor of hemispheric literature at the University of Tampa as well as an author her book\nThe transatlantic zombie slavery rebellion and living deaths\nExplores the transatlantic slave trade as the historical center of this on the narrative Sarah thank you so much for being here\nIt's my pleasure that is such a big title and I found researching researching\nThis topics so much zombie related academic literature your book of course also race suppression and is on the uh essays on cross cultural appropriations of the Caribbean traditions zombies a cultural history generation zombie fest goes on and on\nHow did this pop culture phenomenon become a college course or\nTheories series of courses and zombie studies\n[noise] well I think that my interest in this um be really came about after I started seeing this incredible surge of of popularity in terms of zombies and I'll just give you what I think is\nThe most signal example was designed the walk phenomenon started around two thousand and three and really\nJust caught on like wildfire and started to dwindle around two thousand and eight but it was the phenomenon where people were dressing up as zombies and showing up in public often completely unrelated to Halloween in may and June all year round\nAnd I thought why is what is happening why why is this imagery resonating so deeply with people\nRight now so I think that the other academics who studied zombies like me\nSort of felt that through popular culture people have a means of\nSpeaking and a kind of different language or languages symbols and that something was happening at the turn of the millennium and we followed suit to study that phenomenon what do you think it was I mean I Know you've done a lot of study on it\nAnd may not be easy to summarize but ah they're mere headline thought on that\nThink I can summarize that actually so I I there are a lot of other scholars and everybody has an opinion some people say they think it was deeply related to nine eleven other people that are very popular idea is that it has to do with the economic downturn\nUh especially because as you noted is the first surge of popularity occurred in the Nineteen thirties with the great depression [noise]\nUm it could be something more and more fish like that\nBecause as you noted is the first surge of popularity occurred in the Nineteen thirties with the great depression [noise]\nUm they could be something more and more ... like the change from the millennium and just a general sort of in this uh dissatisfaction with the way that ... humanity was headed\nUm I personally think that there was there was a lot of different things happening at the time and\nThey generally we gravitate towards the imagery of zombie when we feel dissent powered um if you just think it's most simple form\nOf those on the as a living corps because as I said he especially before it became violent before it became a cannibal before it became contagious ... was really just a dead body that had been raised from its grave by a witch doctor\nAnd so that is just such a symbol of this empowerment it's life continuing to slog on 'em and it really does empowered state so I think\nWe as a culture and I I Would say you know it it really was a worldwide phenomenon so it must have just been something I'm In the air throughout the globe um felt sort of that the people in power weren't listening to us\nThat that's why this on me it was so popular at that time what why those early is on the films in the Nineteen thirties\nSo that first wave of zombie films really came out of historically um the u._s. occupation of Haiti a there was a political occupation of Haiti from Nineteen Fifteen to Nineteen thirty four\nAnd I'm as a result of that long period when we had troops overseas a lot of people were coming back from Haiti and writing memoirs telling stories of dead men working in the cane fields as William Seabrook\nWrote in his book the magic island that's chilling yes it is chilling and that's exactly the reaction that Hollywood directors had when they sort of started coming across this material whether it be\nIn a sort of pseudo anthropological tax like ... or whether it was in just these autobiographies from Marines who had been stationed um in Haiti\nAnd the idea that um that there was this folklore figure of um a living corps in Haiti was something that immediately Hollywood just grabbed onto and said oh this is something uh you know we ... we can make good with this this chilling exactly as he said\nSo that first wave of zombie cinema still very much keeps to the original mythology um it they're still Lou do imply there's there\nSo that first wave of zombie cinema still very much keep to the original mythology um they're still Lou do implied there's there are the courses that are raised are are very powerless um they might in some of the films turned against their master but they tend to be people there are a far cry\nFrom the millennials on base that we have that are there fast that are scary that are tearing fluctuate with their teeth\nSo the whole story of how we get from that first\nUm does empowered zombie in Nineteen thirty four to the truly terrifying zombie though that um were hunted by today is I'm a very big subject too much to tackle in this conversation but it is something that I've written about in my book and um that other people as you noted had written about as well\nSo it really caught on during a deeply anxious time in American history the great depression and we're both noted people weren't really sure what their next meal is coming from and they ended up hiring country's future wasn't flux\nSo besides being this creepy folklore figure brought from elsewhere what did zone these due to kind of capture that cultural feeling of anxiety\nLanguage is a wonderful human beings can produce down by moving our mouths are than comprehensible to someone else did yours is a miracle it really is\nWe've

visitors never left many hairs from whole town about UGA students who got adventurous and did not live to regret it and\nBut first we're continuing our conversation with Sarah Juliet lauro from the University of Tampa about the origin of zombies\nShe is among a growing field I Will say of zombie scholars and author of the transatlantic zombie slavery rebellion and living debt\nThere is a fair a lot of debate about cultural appropriation and what belongs to whom what kind of a Halloween costumes Kenya where what are the dynamics of power involved in cultural bar wings and tell us out of the zombie story came about through slavery in colonial occupation so\nDoes this zombie story\nThat help us understand or or even complicate ideas about cultural appropriation\nComplicates them in a way that I feel is so relevant tore and so important and I'm really glad you asked that question\nSo when I was a young graduate students going to Haiti um to write this book and and I'm excited to be in the culture that does on became from that was basically my face it for the book was look at the way that Hollywood culturally appropriate in this image\nIt to be in the culture that does on became from that was basically my thesis for the book was look\nAt the way that Hollywood culturally appropriated this imagery which is so important to you and we shaped it and made it about ourselves\nI was astonished by the reaction that I got from Haitians and this has completely helped me to change my my thinking about actually so many things so here's what I learned in Haiti\nHaitians said how dare you think they you culturally appropriate at us we have invaded you are so powerful that you couldn't help but be enchanted by our mythology\nAnd I thought that was so incredible and it just was a great reminder of the way that power never works one way if you feel the need to culturally appropriate assemble it's because it has some kind of power for you\nIt makes me think of how ... century we are indeed even about\nQuestions of appropriation and being raised in the idea is so big back in twenty love and the CDC posted a series of articles called preparedness one oh one zombie apocalypse\nAnd the person who wrote them a rear admiral Ali Khan he was the deputy director of the national Center for emerging and zoonotic if I'm saying that properly\nInfectious diseases and knows something that we don't know\nHow likely is on the outbreak [laughter]\nI I I wouldn't put any money on it and Vegas well do you think that scientists have scientists have appropriated that part of popular culture what to communicate to the masses as that's what it is about\nThink I think it's a convenient tool I think that um the zombie preparedness is a good way to talk about preparedness for other things that might be too painful to actually think about like a mass shooter\nUm if we're kind of trying to look into the future and St ... what's going to happen now in the field of zombies I wouldn't say that zombies are going to step off the silver screen and out of the television set\nAnd into our real lives but I Do try to guess at what the next evolution and zombies is going to be\nAnd I have to say I'm I think it's going to be zombies who can wield guns historically it's been very rare that zombies can use any kind of tool other than Iraq or a club that they might happen to to pick up but I think we're so plagued right now I'm by these\nYou can use any kind of tool other than Iraq or a club that they might happen to to pick up but I think we're so plagued right now I'm by these epidemics as mass shootings that I Would be really surprised if someone doesn't\nMake a zombie narrative soon um that's about zombies getting their hands on guns and just wielding mass destruction\nAnd thinking about the zombie popularity reaching the crescendo in the late sixties and early seventies and then dropping off in the eighties so what was happening culturally that ... in their graves at that time\nThat's a great question I'm not sure I have a satisfactory answer for you accept that I Do think I mean they're just they're they're ebbs and flows along a lot of people think it just has to do with trends in popularity but I I really go back to the fact that\nIn the new millennium was undeniable that there was a resurgence there was a zombie boom and I think that once\nOnce we had sort of bigger fish to fry as a society it\nBecame less popular to to dress up as zombies and go out into the public sphere of for example I think that you know most recently a lot of those same people who are dressing up as on these\nIn two thousand six has been actually just going out and their regular clothes and protesting on the weekends or they've been um you know registering people to vote they've been actually acting out politically where's this zombie is kind of this place holder for me for political action\nDoes on me is an image that's most resonant when you feel unhappy but there's not a darn thing you can do about it so I think right now we're in a mode where where obviously people aren't happy right now in this country on for a variety of different reasons but\nThey're not feeling does empowered they're feeling like there are steps that they can take\nMy personal prognostications is that um if we continue if we ended up feeling that democracy is no longer working that our votes are really not being counted\nThat we really don't have a say in government that the people we send to Washington to vote how we want to vote are just doing their own thing\nUh I think we're going to see another zombie rise math so that's\nJump the idea that rather than people being like George Romero living in this culture that has permeated with zombies and they just pick up the zombie thing that they were actually dressing up as ... as some form of protest I Do I think it was almost like a ...\nYou did with zombies and they just pick up the zombie thing that they were actually dressing up as ... as a some form of protest I Do I think\nIt was almost like a practice for protest it wasn't wasn't an act of protest it was sort of I think I called it a dress rehearsal for protest it was saying\nYou know we ... if we wanted to we could organize we could show up here at a specific time and place and there would be ...\nOf us but it wasn't a protest it had no commentary it had nothing actually that that to say these on be moms but um but I now and nowadays I feel like people do have things to say and they're finding a variety of different ways to express themselves\nI Wonder if on your trips to Haiti or reading those early accounts those journals brought back from Haiti or to the U.S from soldiers best scary stories that you've heard in your studies ... [noise]\nI don't know if I have a best scary story I think the most surprising story I have is that I was speaking with um practitioners who do in Haiti and\nHe said that he had been contacted by NASA\nThat NASA wanted him to give him the secrets of vacation to use for to develop hyper sleep and that sounds crazy but if you actually\nThink about what ... is scientifically it makes a lot of sense it was a series of different poisons one poison to give the appearance of death [laughter]\nUm so that the family members would be tricked and bury them in their graves and then another poison to keep them and sort of a drugged up half alive half dead state where they can only follow simple instructions", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "31"}
