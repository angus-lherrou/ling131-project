nearly fifty three thousand voter registrations are on hold\nThe secretary of state's office sites discrepancies than those forms and violations of law which requires voter registration information to exactly match driver's licenses state ID cards or Social Security records\nSeveral civil rights organizations have filed a federal suit to over to overturn the exact match requirement\nAJC government reporter mark nice he has been following this story hello mark I wanted well thank you for being here first can you clarify de ... match law which has passed and twenty Seventeen what kind of discrepancies can trigger a mismatch\nThere are a number of discrepancies that can cause a mismatch a conflicting or incomplete dates of birth a\nMisspelling in a name a hyphenated name a\nConflict between government documents on a maiden name versus a married name or with some names if you use a ... over it and for example um that could potentially trigger any\nThing that is different between a driver's license or Social Security record and what you write down on your voter registration applications could potentially be interpreted as a discrepancy\nAnd this law was an attempt to catch voter fraud correct yes and to make sure that Georgia's voter registration lists are accurate you don't want people on voter registration lists who\nShouldn't be able\nWho shouldn't be registered people who might have been deceased or people who\nAre not citizens because citizens aren't eligible to devote so what kind of data do we have on voter fraud in Georgia is it a is it a big problem\nBased on what we know it's a small problem voter fraud is rare in Georgia and nobody wants voter fraud but the number of cases that we see a photo of voter fraud are small\nSo we have fifty three thousand people now in this last in a statement just under seven million registered voters which makes could make a great difference in a tight election the secretary of state and you got the gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp office called the a P report bogus\nAnd says people can just show their photo ID when voting to resolve the discrepancy so\nMark will people actually be disenfranchised by this exact

[noise]\n\nFrom Georgia Public broadcasting guesses on second thought I'm Virginia Prescott today we're exploring how voting works in Georgia from the basics to the more controversial\nIs the first day of early voting in Georgia which runs and telling them per second if you sign up to vote early what do you have to do where do you do it and what the heck is a provisional ballot\nWell here to demystify the processes MIT political science professor Charles Stuart founding director of the MIT election data and science lab which measures how each state does managing national\nElections Charles welcome thank you\nAnd also with us Aaron Haynes wax she's an Atlanta native who covers race and ethnicity nationally for the Associated Press she's covered the\nRole of black voters in Georgia upcoming elections among other things in Aaron hello Hi how are you very well\nThank you both for joining us uh both Georgia NATO's by the way we've learned to Charles ... lab measured state's election performance and categories like absentee ballots provisional ballots and turnout rate so so overall how was Georgia doing\nWell you know Georgia is also um the the the way in which we do this measure\nBallots and turnout rates so so overall how's Georgia doing\nWell you know Georgia is a so um the the the way in which we do this measuring um is through an online publication called the elections performance index and\nWhen we look at the various um indicators and an index and there's about Seventeen of them we find that Georgia actually is about in the middle of all the states in terms of how it performs whether it be in the area of turnout or provisional ballots are absentee ballots Georgia in many ways on election performance is about an average they\nMight do want to look at provisional ballots but first the ... ... what does one way that people can vote in Georgia and this is through early voting so what exactly is early voting\nEarly voting is a window a head of the actual election day it can be as\nLate as maybe the weekend before but up to maybe forty five days before the election depending on your state and about two thirds of the country ah allows early voting with out at an excuse\nGeorgia being one of them the state where I currently live Pennsylvania does not have early voting it's election day only voting and so citizens in Georgia have the option to cast their ballot starting today and ending a November second\nThey can go to their polling their designated early voting polling place and cast their ballot for this year's election starting now\nAnd he said excuse what are some of the reasons that people do choose to or get have reason to vote early\nAbsolutely well because you don't need or even again in Georgia you can do it frankly out of convenience\nPerhaps you're not going to be off work on a on the actual day of the election perhaps you're going to be out of town for the actual day of the election perhaps\nYour due date for their child might be the day of the election I mean there could be any number of reasons why uh the actual date of the election doesn't work for you but you have three weeks to go ahead and get it done with with no reason necessary\nSo Charles how does your to compare with other states in turn out for early voting\nWill Georgia is one of the states that has the largest use of early voting I'm In the country I mean ranks right up there with Texas in Tennessee which are two other pioneers [noise]\nUm I'm In the use of the mode um in the last presidential election roughly half of Georgians amused the early voting mode um it's been more variable in the mid term um ranging from about a quarter\nThe ... election roughly half of Georgians amuse the early voting\nMode um it's been more variable in the mid term um ranging from about a quarter of about forty percent and so the question for this election is going to be um whether the campaigns mobilized people early and get those numbers up or whether it will be down in the in the in the twenty five percent range\nDo we know demographically Aaron or Charles ... who is choosing to vote early here in in Georgia\nYeah so I think you're twenty fourteen I think what we saw with about a thirty three percent of those early votes for African Americans are compared to about sixty one percent of early votes coming up from white voters\nAnd so uh you know to Charles was point this is definitely something of that folks\nDo take advantage of what will be interesting to see uh this year is because ah especially on the Democratic side for example with Stacey Abrams because her strategy is revolving around reaching out to so many new voters or either voters who haven't always voted in\nIn a ... as regularly um making sure that those people are aware of the fact that they can vote now uh you know and seeing how that may affect turnout could to make this interesting was that many new people on the role\nModel and not something that you've been watching carefully or where are these new voters coming from you know George is a big state um big urban population so pretty much in in Atlanta but in other cities how about the rural voters\nVoters are definitely going to factor into this election about a third of ... of rural voters and the state our people of color\nAnd frankly these are people who are because of\nThe Caribbean during the way that their districts are have been drawn have not always felt like they could make a difference at the local level but statewide elections obviously are not subject to\nAh the rules of gerrymandering so to speak and so uh those people will factor into state wide elections or you know so these are people that that we\nUm don't tend to hear about so much because so much of the focus especially around the black vote tends to be\nIn places like Atlanta I clearly but also Albany or savannah are making that there are people in in smaller places to ah you know that are in counties that are majority black that could that could definitely make a difference in this election\nI wanted to wrap up this idea in the early voting Charles\nWell I you know they are in counties that are majority black that could that could definitely make a difference and the election\nAnd under wraps up this idea that early on and Charles there are two ways to vote early absentee ballots by now early in person setting so how does a voter choose which one is right for them\n[noise] well I think um I mean part of his the convenience I'm part of it also is on the assurance that your vote is going to be counted and um the research that I've done in other people have done suggests um I Would I Would argue um the suggests that the early voting a mode is probably the more secure and um\nIf you are really somebody who's turning out to vote because you're really committed to your candidate you want to make sure your vote counts\nUm the early voting um being in person and gives you a chance to resolve questions both with your registration and with the ballot\nAt the moment that they occur um absentee voting in it looks like absentee voting in Georgia I'm by mail um has continued to be the more traditional people ... um people out of town students et cetera um who really have no other choice than to do it by mail\nHave you heard this that we can only make so many decisions a day before we kind of run down our decision making batteries\nSo here's the decision I'd like to spare you what to listen to tonight at ten o'clock\nIn advance it'll be ... ... it's a date

director his\nTeam with the secretary of state's office gets to work building the layout of the ballots as soon as candidates are set Harvey's office creates twenty five hundred different versions of a ballot with everything from the governor's race to weather Sandy Springs residents can buy alcohol earlier on Sundays\nTake each county and then you take the different ballot combinations and you take the fall\nTo weather Sandy Springs residents can buy alcohol earlier on Sundays\nYou take each county and then you take the different ballot combinations and you take the qualified candidates and you just start plugging them into the slots if you if you think about it that way until you've got every\nRace in every question every candidate account for accounting\nSpin those ballad files are hand delivered to each county where local officials double check to make sure everything is accurate once that's done the officials load the ballots from a secure server on to memory cards tied to specific precincts the cards are also matched up to a specific serial number on a specific machine\nEven the seals used to secure those machines have their serial numbers tracked [noise]\nThat's the sound of a machine being unsealed so it can undergo logic inaccuracy testing it's one of four that belong to the black rock voting precinct in Fayetteville twenty miles south of Atlanta Fayette County elections director Floyd\nJones of what we're doing is we're taking the machine were literally ensuring that it actually works\nAnd then we're up loaning the new balance in through the machines so they can be prepared to roll out on election day\nThe process takes just a few minutes for a machine [noise]\nEverything from the ... of the print or to the click of the card reader undergo scrutiny tennis sample tally is run [noise]\nJones says all three hundred machines is county uses will be tested over the course of several days\nWhen that's done we Salem we've set them back on the racks and we have a favorite for election [noise]\nSo what happens on election day\nThe machines are delivered the seals are broken and poll workers are ready for business at seven AM after you check in at the polling place you're handed a yellow voter access card that goes inside the machine but how does it know which ballot goes on the screen a tiny computer chip what's your name and balance style loaded on\nFits the same type a chip that you have on your credit cards\nThat's Richard Baron who oversees Fulton County is elections\nAll the ballots are available on the DARE but that one will only activate the ballot that is correlates to your residence\nVote is captured on the machines memory card and the yellow card is returned to the poll worker wants the last person in line has voted poll managers consolidate the vote tallies onto a single memory card shut down and seal the voting machines do some paperwork and then drive results to a central location from there\nVote tallies onto a single memory card shut down and seal the voting machines do some paperwork and then drive results to a central location from their vote totals are uploaded to the state's election night reporting system where it tallies are posted on line\nInsulting which is George ... most populous county that takes a while so this year in full ... law enforcement will escort the memory cards from five checking centers to the main elections warehouse but the process isn't over even after candidates declare victory and the website says a hundred percent of precincts are reporting\nHere's Kris Harvey with the secretary of state's office\nSomebody conceding or the news calling something has zero effect on anything we do we still have to account for every ballot this gas and even it doesn't end the morning after the election\nThere's still some mailed an absentee military in overseas ballots that must be counted plus provisional ballots cast on election day counties certify the results by the Monday after the election the state's certified as a result a week after that\nBut this could be one of the last time this process is used seven vendors have submitted options to replace Georgia's voting machines and elections infrastructure at the request of a commission set up by the secretary of state Brian Kemp their goal is to have a new system in place for the twenty twenty presidential election\nState than its share with me this morning with more and the mechanics of George's election system into digging deeper hello Steve in the morning after right after Richard mellor he's a computer science professor at Georgia Tech welcome metric either thanks thanks so much for being\nEven at ... a lot of information that is not just one big counts George's one hundred and fifty nine county sent their own local tens camp\nOr their significant ... between fade away that fat county and Fulton County administer elections that the local level\nSo a lot of things that are similar with how they run elections are there are elections a there's the voting machines that counted they have to have the tally is to have to put the men\nBut the ballots are different for each county you know Fulton County has certain elections that are only for a vote and county and even within Fulton County there are certain elections like cities have different things or different a\nLocal options um so the way the counties around there was a hundred and fifty nine counties there's a hundred and fifty nine county elections board there is a hundred and fifty nine different a\nCheck in places that they have full and county actually it's five checking centers and so each county kind of runs its own election has its own volunteer poll workers in systems and things that run within\nSo that they have full and county actually five checking centers and so each county kind of runs its own election and has its own volunteer poll workers and says some things that run within the states a larger system\nRight than the states I can is part and then the question here which you're listening to Stephen story you've heard the you know all of a different checkpoints Tony how are you ... do you feel like ... ...\nSo it's a very complicated system um it's um technology that that has evolved over the last Thirty years and and frankly speaking has been lashed together or with stopgap measure so so what um what Chris Harvey described I think is from an IT standpoint a real nightmare\nTrying to trying to figure out where the vulnerabilities are what people should trust what they what they should and trust is a is a real issue\nWhere we get from Steven hurting data travels through ... down their hand deliver aid for and finding out who wins an election ... percent of the protocols for keeping all of that care\nWell we we don't think in terms of security so much is trust so as as you as you think about the process of of of um of voting imagine who you're going to vote for going to the the polling place casting a ballot\nOr going home at night watching your your vote counted um you want to make sure that that that whole chain of events or has been properly taking care of carry it and and in the case of Georgia is simply that simply hasn't we focus on on specific points in the technology chain\nUh and uh and I think that's part of the issue is coming from there's a there's a sense that the weakest link uh is is pretty weak and and people are are frankly concerned about\n... election security ... think that we have heard about already if hackers probing network or and so what does that mean\nProbing so um I I I I like to think about um uh my my kids favorite movie home alone um if you remember I'm home alone the the the burglars we're kind of trolling through the
