respectively and central Georgia working to salvage what is left to their crops have just been hearing absolute\nDevastation Randy is joining us from Irwin county mark from ... county many I just want to pick up with you you asked to consumers to help out by buying Georgia ground pecans and I want to get back to that question about what was going on with the price of the kinds given the trade war with China\nIt's been a very very difficult situation our company for the most part has been exporting search a Nineteen Ninety nine and it was about nine percent of our book of business\nAnd we were doing about twenty twenty five million dollars a year worth of sales and to China and as of today we did not have a single book um be able to get out to get into China\nAs a result the ... the U.S supplies being built back into the domestic market and the prices are being depressed or and or down as as much as a dollar to a dollar and a half pound ah on on the whole shock which means that in Georgia all all that's gone\nUh and are down as ... as much as a dollar a dollar and a half a pound a on on a coke side which means that in Georgia alone that's going on top of the hurricane or dollars a hundred million dollars just on price alone due to tear for\nSo we're already\nHad one hurt one storm that came through in regards to the terror of hurricane was just a fishing cook the girl a if a terrible situation and the gun industry in Georgia\nSo you might you weren't going to get caught and growing gained about sixty thousand barrels ... can send a signing whom point how do you think you and your colleagues who who's going to have\n'em well by the storm is that what you're referring to this time yeah\nYes um well you know we could lose just the cotton gin alone could lose half a million dollars you know we were you know slated to do sixty sixty five thousand barrels his years while we were anticipating we went out and actually rented more warehouse space 'cause we are going into base crops we've had in years\nAnd um say one thing let me just stop here and just mentioned this we had ... came through last year and a\nKnow an hammered us last year we thought we had never seen anything I mean we had at that point you know like Irma blue are caught and on the ground you know and\nLook the stop literally on the grounds that the difference was Irma came earlier in season and we weren't as close to harvest as with all this time and um say are farmers or grasping you know\nFor you know this was going to be the year that they you know paid out their loans and yeah you know the banks extended you know some of them that carry over you know to this year um and the banks tip them you know work with him\nIn the big question mark is out there now with here we are again another year or this devastated devastation we've never seen and people's thinking luck will or the vice going to do with this year you know they they were hesitant about going with this you know for two thousand and Eighteen\nAnd I was glad to hear the commissioner mentioned you know the debt reconstruction and the bank's summit\nBecause that's that's where we're at I mean I'm afraid that we're going to lose a lot of our farmers a number of our farmers are I mean not and these are good bombers these are people has been farming for you know for generations and generations and they're smart farmers but I mean we've had disease we've had penicillin\nThese are people has been farming for you know for generations and generations and they're smart farmers but I mean we've had disease we've had passed away and it's you know we've had storms\nAnd you know the bank can only do so much I mean we know that got rules rags with their own you know that they had to go on and I'm\nJust a lot of uncertainty out there but back to your original question um I mean we could we know we could be off you know ah thirty percent on our bells what we didn't hear it again and I'm you know that could be five six hundred thousand dollar loss for us\nAnd our farmers you know I mean they've got a lot of money tied up in this crop ends in some cases they're not going to harvest anything\nYeah well that's a question you all had been in mhm from many generations you and your family yes and as you said to me that some people may not pick it up again would you encourage than any ... sounds like a really really hard I just had it\nOn calling at mistakes eh what would you have\nA good question and I I've been asked that question and I've been asked to go out to ... and and what fields and and you know try to help them decide whether it's worth picking cotton or not and\nAnd there's as much frustration as I've ever seen and these guys well thank you mark I I just don't I don't see it you know I just can't see it mainly they were burned to caught and\nYou know peanut butter peanuts we grow a lot of the ... they seem to weather the storm okay you know and the corn did okay the process not so great for corn but um you know Columbus already harvest is an earlier crops planted in March and\nThe big question mark is is from what I'm hearing his own cotton alone you know it was that it's a mark I just can't keep growing caught and you know here we are two years and we've been hit by storms and\nCotton is very vulnerable you know to storms and um I don't know I really don't know what the answer is you know the you know I don't I really don't know I don't answer that question\nFor you Randy in something you can just I Am I'm going to be done\nI'm gonna tell you last year we lost over a thousand crazed are long and at that time I walked across orchards and uh and I said look I don't know about this but then I went back and planted those spots in and and you know my grandchildren one day to harvest pecans and courses now I'm Out here today\nBut back and planted those spots in and and\nCounting on my grandchildren one day to harvest pecans and courses\nNow I'm Out here today was probably at least another thousand trees on the ground and just the everyday crowd guy has got just ... Powell toppling which which is going by\nIs going to do not crying because of my neighbors that gaining getting their orchards under trees are in the woods work better off than that and we are going to be able to salvage part of our crop\nBut I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I had a crowd of ...\nAnd this has not been very this is so frustrating to\nAnd and the pecan orchard and all of us pecan growers because there's just more than growing because it's a way of life it becomes becomes a bit of perspective before you get up every morning and you and this is your life is what it's like your children\nAnd then one day it's not there anymore and and you just do you get so frustrated with how your goal handle tomorrow and we're out there today trying to handle harvest fish just so frustrating but\n... you don't stop a book goes you know I'm a fifth generation pecan form of my great great grandfather planted wanted to first orchards and the state of novels five trees he play back in the Eighteen hundreds\nWhich are like part of the family and so\nHow do you how do you you can't walk away but then I'm sitting here with such a debt load and if\nYou ask your question well how do I repay the U.S now on how to start over and I've got a son now who left a very good job but come on the farm and he's looking at me like dad watched the mole hole for us so I said look we don't get this [noise]\nSo we don't get\nMe my not expanding coverage Randy my keys Andy knew just jump on the line from keep eating ... he's the argument that they can find you know I don't think he's ... he's been covering the recovery effort enjoying than any hello", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "16"}
