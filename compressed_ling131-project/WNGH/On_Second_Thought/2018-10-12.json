Atlanta that was in Nineteen Seventy one leg to ask you both what is your most powerful a resident memory ... century right here sure I think that\nMy most resident memory of fried has to be my first pride which was in two thousand and one I was in the middle of a a fairly difficult coming out process and had moved from a small town in Georgia to Atlanta in June right before pride\nAnd I had really never known a community of out\nClear people and certainly didn't know that there was this vibrant thriving happy community it I could be a part of and it really it changed my life and a lot of ways because I realized that\nA lot of the narratives that I had grown up with didn't have to be true and that I could have a really amazing life as an out a person and you say I did I've never left right and how about you dusty what's your memory\nYeah I think is the first time it pride there's something just incredibly special about that moment for me I think I was Nineteen or Twenty years old a living at home going to college and still sneaking a way to be with the boyfriend nobody knew I had and\nI went to Long Beach brought I grew up in Southern California and being able to hold his hand and walk around in that space for the first time\nFeeling completely safe and who I was feeling really proud about who I was a ...\nHonestly life changing in and truly made me want to continue you know when you're still in the closet is a hard thing to go through and for me pride was a step towards starting to live\nThose were the pride parades about life in Atlanta and savannah respect as like how difference to where you grow up for you Jamie\nAtlanta is very different I grew up in Rome, Georgia and land is very different now a lot of ways from Rome um I didn't experience a lot of\nReally visible or homophobia growing up but there were also not any out where people that I knew there were some texts from you know the church and other just just society and in Atlanta I think that still exists quite a bit in certain\nThat I knew there were subjects from you know the church and other just just society and in Atlanta I think that's still exists quite a bit in certain circles but we do have a safe havens and spaces together and pockets of you know a\nReally vibrant algae to life we have bars in space it together and that doesn't really exist and most small towns in Georgia\nThat and you moved to as you said to Atlanta and the early two thousand and one of the larger pride celebrations like those in Atlanta and savannah mean for folks who don't have celebrations in our small towns\nWell for a lot of people who come to Atlanta Pride a there from small towns so and Lana pride is a destination for a lot of people we're the largest pride in the cars in the south and about a third of our people come from out of state and about\nI'm a third of people come from Georgia but not Atlanta so you get a lot of people who are experiencing\nA space that they don't get year round this is the one weekend of the year where they can come and they can be out and they can meet people like them they can\nYou buy a lesbian the T shirt you know it doesn't exist in their home town [laughter] and so you know it's it's really a a destination for a lot of people and it can be really it can be really happy and exciting it can also be really emotional\nBecause people\nCan sometimes realize what they're missing or the difference you can just be so stark but you know we I think that we experienced the whole gamut of emotions during a pride weekend most of us\n... has certainly expanded I mean major cities like San Francisco New York I'm In celebrating for a long time smaller cities Montgomery Tuscaloosa\nI noticed that this year a number of really small cities in the Bible belt Auburn open like a\nAh Winchester, Virginia stark Phil Mississippi what is that shift to me and for pride it does say I'm going to ask you just because you're in a small city but you know a little you're surrounded by a lot more rural area\nYeah well I mean we're a smallish city a hundred and forty thousand people or so so are you know we're certainly better than a lot of those towns or rural Georgia but um\nYou know I think it's been really interesting to watch your right there's so many new prides and with mixture being the fiftieth anniversary of stone wall a water incredible thing to see the sort of rebirth and reimagining of prides and uh your for for us as a smaller pride and I know\nOh what an incredible thing to see the sort of rebirth and reimagining of pride and uh for for us as a smaller pride and I know for a lot of pride it's this process of\nFiguring out what pride means for our community and um do as we're game are hitting that fiftieth anniversary point and knowing how much left there is to accomplish the rebirth of activism and pride has a really fascinating and wonderful thing to see\nMcCain mentioned a lot of people from out of town for you in Savannah how many people do you estimate her from at a time\nWhen we have a almost fifty percent of our attendees are from out of town and it's really interesting to Atlanta a gym you sing gets so

Q. people of color to Atlanta\nYeah absolutely well I actually have a story I'm about I'm a woman who's actually from Atlanta I'm so\nShe's kind of remain here and remained it I'm I'm prominent activists in the community\nUm but she told me this story about a a club on ... bridge caught numbers and the seventies that she uh she heard about and really wanted to visit a and the beginning she thought she was bisexual and started to they want it to kind of explore sexuality would go to numbers um you know every weekend\nGet out of the car walk up to the door sweating profusely star to shake go back to the van and you know get in the car and go right\nUm one day this kind of happened a few times uh she went back home or a sister in law was there and kind of ask like what's going on like did you go in what are you doing here um and her sister in law then said you know\nNow we're going back I'm taking you back so she followed her and her band um got out the car walked her inside the club a set\nYou know we're going back I'm taking you back so she followed her and her van um got out the car walked her inside the club a sat there with her ... was she said to her you know\nLike are you okay are you good and so she's like yeah and so she got up and left\nSister in law got up and left a she ended up I'm staying for a while and dancing with a woman in the club they ended up going into her van and at that point sushi and proclaimed an oral history I found out at that point that I was not bisexual [laughter]\nSo I'm\nJust all these kinds of stories of becoming all of these stories of I'm kind of finding oneself finding one's sexuality I'm outside actually a lot of stories around clubs around these sites I remember it rains ... those were places where al ... out in the sights of community yeah\nDuncan for you you move to Atlanta in the eighties where where did you come come from\nKansas City Missouri so what brought you here um I was coming here to celebrate my refund graduation from college and um my dear friend and cook them home and he's from forming\nAnd he offered me or to free week vacation but he also hurt or why on their mind and so and the two weeks that our our it was the perfect two weeks for me back home\nSo the son of a second week was a Labor Day weekend\nWhich is now considered black pride but back then it was just Labor Day you're going to Atlanta\nBut a whole lot of um African American I'm gay and lesbian folks will come in town and so um\n[noise] but Sunday I was at a picnic out on remake Terry backyard and I thought it was just going to be a regular picnic and when I arrived there were more than two hundred man in his backyard partying and members from above looking [noise] um most of them\nYou know urban and um or or being I'm\nLooking men and they were all my dress to the nine than we were having a\nOne day when you add in Kansas City anymore in Kansas\nCity any more I thought that every blood to a person in America was in my backyard\nYou started work with the aid Atlanta\nKansas City anymore in terms\nOf sort of giving more I thought that every block three person them from America would remember your\nYou started work with aid Atlanta a few years later is the first black gay outreach worker with that organization that this was of course the eighties a devastating time that he actually for the community are ready to\nLearn Oprah's um\nTwo full time employees and for her time record for\nSo this was of with the transformational point of course the AIDS crisis you know after stone wall one of those big markers or in the gay community after pride a started being celebrating [noise]\nSo that has changed obviously so much in a in a community ... what are the kinds of stories and things that you were hearing from that time that make you think about that transformation and how important it was\nUm well I remember I'm having a conversation with Duncan actually after um we did his or history and we were talking specifically about I'm a black gay club on kind of the west side of Atlanta and talking about what it meant for\nBlack gay folks in that era to be in the club and and I remember him saying to me which is this still resonates with me he said we were dancing for our lives\nParticularly because um you didn't know who was going to be there the next week right you know companies are being decimated and I'm\nStill ... there's a moment particularly when um you you gather\nYou've dined together you eat together you share stories they're these particular moments of kind of activity that that really um [noise] that that demonstrate the power of what it means to be black queer and in Atlanta\nAnd community I mean I'm thinking that the experience for me race obviously adds a real dimension to these stories especially in the south so Duncan for you what are some of the differences that you've observed between experiences of a black algae ... over the years and their white
