they were going in\nYeah um I like to say they don't see me come in [laughter]\nI'm not originally going to be an actress of what I'm understanding you were going into law\nI was I was I was working at\nI went to school for criminal justice graduated uh\nFrom Westchester university right outside of Philly and turn it the da's office in homicide unit I worked in law firms that the law was what I wanted to do until I you know started in ... and\nWorking at the law firms and seeing that it was just not for me and then I had to really go for my dream and go for this far fetched dream that I had always dreamed about 'em but didn't really know how to make it come true right didn't really have people in the industry around me no one in my family was in the industry and it was just something that I decided to um\nStart doing in Philly and I I I Want an audition while I was working at the law firm and they fired me because I wasn't supposed to go but little me went anyway [laughter]\n\nI went anyway and I got back to work the next day can log on to my computer they were like yeah we need to think human resources they fired me better than my life because from that day on I started to travel to New York and you know take advantage of all the opportunities that there was in Philly and here I Am today\nIt's amazing they ask what that first audition was for\nIt was for a foreman mills it was like for you know the store in Philly yes we're print informing males and I ended up looking at and I was in like all the former ... windows and you couldn't tell me that I made it at that point\nYou know each each each opportunity a gives you confidence east it's time you book as an actor model or just an artist in general whatever that is um\nWhen you book a job and you see that things are happening and it gives you the confidence to keep going so for me I was like well this seems to be working for me so from there I went to New York and I booked a soap opera um which ended up getting cancer and then I moved to LA I just try to you know make things happen locally before I um made the move to LA\nYou know I Believe a training ground there starts at home you're so right

playing one I I mean playing a superhero upbringing that suggested I was like you know we all have a bit of a superhero inside of us and it's about just tapping into what that is and walking boldly in
