Jay Madden mental health center in Illinois this was installed in Nineteen sixty seven so that's right in the civil war\nA playlist commissioned by the John game Madden mental health center in Illinois this was installed in Nineteen sixty seven so that's right in the civil rights era and I'm I'm curious Sean yet about\nHow Richards works fits into that if other African American artists of the time because now we know there weren't that many working or relatively few\nWell it's it's interesting that you say that because I'm One of the things that um my research and my um\n[noise] if you could say my profession kind of tries to eradicate is the sense that\nThere was an absence of art is there might have been an absence of recognition for many artist of color but there were several artist that we're operating in working I'm particularly in the late sixties and that was actually a watershed period for many and tried to define um\nYou know their their role in their function I'm In relationship to the civil rights movement um and in other cases just part of the overall art\nUm world of art itself um I think that Richard stands apart in the sense that um he had already been active as early as the Nineteen fifties um varies quite successful um and you know it was kind of in some cases um seem to be kind of an enigma because he was\nYou know relatively successful but he still had many of the same obstacles um that many of other artist of colors um had at the time and probably continue to have um during this period um but um\nBut Richard was one of those shining stars ... he had an early I mean he had early retrospective exhibitions as early as I think he was in his thirties [noise] um one major one moment that took place in Nineteen Seventy one um but they had acquired a sculpture of his I'm entitled Iraq me I'm ... years earlier\nUm so I think one of the things that um\nThis um this particular exhibition demonstrate as how prolific I'm an artist such as Richard ... is um and continues to be um so\nAnd public art is a very particular kind of work he's huge pieces that huge outlast material and money obviously I'm ... and Richard for you you have to I'm guessing be aware of where they're going to go and how do you how do you get yourself in that heads they how do you think about where\nSee I'm an amateur for you you have to I'm guessing be aware of where they're going to go and how do you how do you get yourself in that ... how do you think about where they're going to fit in space while you're there in your ...\n... let me go back to the beginning you know you mentioned the\nThe first major a commission that I had for this a mental health center in in a in a suburb of Chicago Illinois a ... an area uh that uh\nThat ... is is kind of a um\n[noise] I'm a a\nA health care oasis you might say on one side of the state dental health center is the Heinz veterans hospital across the street is Loyola university's medical center but anyway I mean that's one thing\nA then going back to\nI ended up doing that I mean people\nAre just are invited a asked to do commissioned works for either built environments yellow like a\nOffice building a hotel a hospital or in a park you know what I mean is is not like a light goes off and he said oh I Want to put a sculpture right\nRight okay so it turns out that uh the uh offer of that commission came from uh the design architect for the project an architect named Walter net ... who was a partner at ... the firmer Skidmore ... and Merrill level\nYou heard of that line [laughter] I said\nRight from the right and and so um\nSo now ah the thing is I'm a Walter ... and his wife dawn Clark niche um\nWho is comptroller of the state of Illinois at the time and the two of them on their own or a avid collectors of art in particularly contemporary art art or of young up and comic artists aren't as important modern art a artist\nAnd I'm a ... Walter ...\nModern art a artist and I'm a Walter and his wife had\nCollected work of mine was on exhibit while I was still a student at the art Institute\nWhich are already interrupt you but and we've got just a minute left in the segment and I wanted to mention that at one of our listeners tweeted that they have a wonderful Richard ... sculpture and it ... the tower aspirations who lives in a commemorative park for Springfield village that's an historic\nAfrican American safe community in Augusta\nAnd I'm Sorry that we don't have the time to hear that story because there's so many players that go into a putting together a huge works like this [noise] um\nWell at least we got that point of that is the artist yes it's a lot of enablers\nYes an enabler like Sean yet showing you what do you think you know what are people going to see what do you hope they see when they walk away from the show\nMidterms are about a lot of things but mostly there were about the president's Marcia is really a vote for me and this year President Trump thinks that's okay\n\nSo what does the math looked like a head of an election that changed everything next time on one\nOne eight It's MORNING at ten on ... on the TV news dot org [noise]\nFor ... comes from generous listeners like you and the Miller theater and Bob no check present featuring legendary folk rock pioneers Steven Stills and Judy Collins November eleventh ...

we were also honored for specialized reporting best anchor best newscast gp news stand with the facts\nOn second thought I'm thinking of Prescott\nFor decades restaurants considered Georgia only stairs more trouble than they were worth\nBut all Easter aquaculture is a fledgling movement dedicated to putting more local oysters on the table I drink a lot about the eager coalition of people helping to cultivate these brainy by valves and his book a high low tide\nBrian ... is a local ... booster and Cal owner of the restaurant chemical house Mayan are far more desirable than harvesting wild oysters\nAnd the context of a restaurant that serving\nMoisture is at a raw bar um yeah I think for the most part that they are I mean we do get wild oysters that are extraordinary that have a you know consistency is that are just shocking and surprising but\nUh for the most part are demographic has a better response to the culture to always choose just because you can control a nearly all the variables but you can't control consistency to some degree and I think that people who are spending money like consistency they always have and they always will so\nIt's something that I think is probably just more attractive to them when they see it in a restaurant\nHow about the taste is there a difference in the case that you can discern\nWhat's your profiles change so much that you know if you took a a wild or Easter and cultured always do that we're growing right next to each other and harvest them at the same time\nYou might taste some differences but you might not um you know the biggest difference is that a lot of these orders that are being farmed are being farmed and floating bags in the wild stuff is sitting in the mud so depending on the makeup of that substrate you might get some like earthy or qualities\nOut of a wild oyster who's growing and the you know on the sea floor as opposed to something that's growing in a in a basket at the surface of the sea\nBefore you started surfing ... from Georgia did any of your clients ask why they weren't on the menu\nUm we haven't had a ton of people ask where the Georgia or issues where when we first opened we did have a lot of people ask where the um the Florida boisterous war but now that that questions being answered I'm you know I'm kind of encouraging people to ask where are the Georgia or stirs\nAndre among the many characters that we need just in ... when do you credit as the first person to farm George at least or is he now hatchery manager\nSo Andrea among the many characters that we made Justin ... when do you credit as the first person to farm Georgia oysters he'd now hatchery manager at the University of Georgia marine extension and Georgia sea grant so what has asked him to start farming oysters and the state\nYou know well he moved down here um to attend grad school in Savannah\nUm and he was already quite obsessive about our culture and oysters you know he had already decided to to make boisterous his life and she got down here and I believe he was at\nA um an oyster roast and was inquiring about where the oysters came from knowing that you know Georgia does have a coast you know he he he will knew that down from from Michigan\nAnd when he found out they were from away he was flabbergasted because you know he could just take one look at our marshes here and he could see\nUm the the you know the relative lack of development and just you know it's it was obvious to him that this was prime minister growing ground\nAll of those ... water men down there who works to hundred mile coast they watched him as he went to experimenting with it so how did she developed his techniques have oyster farm me\nWell his techniques were based on French method which is used in in various ways it's essentially called collecting spat which is the spawned the oyster the oyster starts spawning in the late spring and do so over the summer\nAnd essentially he was doing what he does now in a hatchery but just out in the wild using\nPlastic um to collect little tiny baby oysters and growing them until they got viable and then moving them into a bags where they could grow fat and healthy\nAnd this is essentially just adapting what the oyster does naturally at all while the oyster will just find whatever decent surface it can to glom onto even the smallest of you know microscopic\nGrain of sand and what he was doing he was just calling to gather\nA method that was very well in use around the world and in this country already but because of culture hadn't been introduced to Georgia and was not being allowed to do the regulations he had to do this crazy round about way that\nAdded hours and hours I'm In into his work life but he was dedicated to do it because he he knows that the Georgia oysters something that should return to prominence\nHe said he began with that the name of his business was at that time spat king oysters [noise] mhm so would that given all that effort what's that\nAnd that's and he said he began with that the name of his business was at that time spat king oysters [noise] mhm so what does that given all that effort what staff\nWill pay off for him ... originally was difficult because he had this ... like I said round about way he had to do that you know it was a little more time intensive than the what is becoming traditional agriculture methods\nThe path for him didn't work out for him because you know he lived in Savannah was wasn't living quite the bottom in life\nUm and had to walk away from it because of the different expenses\nYour book reveals a whole system and not just the people who are harvesting our farming but the research in areas that agriculture scientists who work collaboratively with Harvard starts making this or do you make the Georgia selfish business shellfish business competitive as bad\nIs it really tense relationship and some places and Brian mentioned cameras caught up in Maine lobstermen and does his daddy and maintain the fisheries there is a pretty contentious relationship how did that work in Georgia\nI think you could describe it as contentious because eat Waterman and there are a special breed um folks at work the water are tough and they're opinionated and and they don't like to be pushed around and you know because they're dealing with a of a food business they have to deal with regulators right\nUm and then they then there are these you know the university researchers who were you know they have PHD's you know where these guys went to the school of hard knocks them\nSo they don't quite see eye to eye on everything um and so what that means is that someone working in extension like just a manly um has to kind of one tried slowly and speak a special language and and it I think it helps when\nFolks who are trying to eight in the industry have experience in the industry like Justin dead\nAnd Brian for you a lot of your business I Would imagine is about the relationships with those who are farming is that correct\nI mean it is for me um to me I I just feel like when you're\nWhen you're selling of food that people are eating raw I mean you you have to you should always be aware of the the risk of the dangers of eating raw ... any ... any sort of raw protein\nUm but you know I just I've just always felt like we could eliminate some of the of Arab ... some of the risk variables by knowing who are buying from knowing how they how they know what type of steward they were and how they treated their release um and I just feel like that at this point in time that\nWe um you know and if it's my opinion it's not everybody's opinion but yeah I mean I think it will help has the best choice\nAnd I just feel like that at this point in time that we um you know and if it's my opinion it's not everybody's opinion but yeah I mean I think it will help has the best or Easter list in the city if not the southeast and I don't think that that's because I'm capable of picking up a phone or sending an email I think it's because we work with the best farmers\nI imagine you could talk about wasters for a really long time just for hearing you I I could go for a little bit [laughter]\nI think ... had become this symbol of wealth and ... you know for lack of a better word that if you see a movie scene and they're trying to take tentative fancy party at oyster shell mhm\n[noise] that's one of the things that I struggle with cars I Wish that it was a a food source that was not alienating from up up up price standpoint and you know hopefully that something that that we can sort of work through as the industry gets a little bit more mature and we're looking for ways to use a use or stirs\nDifferently but yeah I mean you know it's one of the biggest difference between wild or oysters and cultured oysters is the fact that you do have to make a\nPretty large investment in equipment and seed and those sorts of them and tore items and it's not without a a considerable start up costs\nManagement and makes me think that Irish satirist Jonathan Swift track he was a bold man that first eight and ... and I think in twenty eight and we can safely say he was a bold man that first farmed and oyster\nAnd Jay this revival surely didn't come easily and at that easy to revival how far along is that where do you think the revival of the oyster farming along they Georgia ... is now\nWell I think you can say that the the the a large a of a boom is is set to begin\nIt's tonight at seven GP and she'd be be dot org

museums around the world including a new exhibition at the Georgia museum of art anew genius Athens campus\nJohn Harris is one of the curators at that institution and she is with us as well today which did you were born in Chicago about your father was from Georgia did did you visit as a child\nA yes or almost every summer so oh your impression of the south welder red dirt [laughter] ...\nUh no but uh uh uh my father was born in ... county and I'm a ... a few remaining cousin's still live there but uh um he he loves a\nEdge during what they now call the great migration to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of uh to Chicago well he has a number of places in or the kinetic the Detroit a but in any way ended up in Chicago\nAnd uh met my mother who move there from rural Illinois around Galesburg mama's Illinois anyway\nUm\nUh so I'm uh\nIn those days vacation consists of a visiting relatives are either in rural Georgia or rural Illinois\nAnd um I I I enjoyed my time here\nYeah when you're first public sculpture play was commissioned by the John Jay Madden mental health center in Illinois this was installed in Nineteen sixty seven so that's right in the civil rights era and I'm I'm curious Sean yet about how Richards works fits into that if other African American\nThat's right in the civil rights era and I'm I'm curious Sean yet about how Richards works fits into that as other African American artist at the time because now we know there weren't that many working or relatively few\nWell it's it's interesting that you say that because I'm One of the things that um my research and my um\n[noise] if you could say my profession kind of tries to eradicate is the sense that\nThere was an absence of art is there might have been an absence of recognition for many artist of color but there were several artist that we're operating in working I'm particularly in the late sixties and that was actually a watershed period for many and tried to define\nYou know their their role in their function I'm In relationship to the civil rights movement um and in other cases just part of the overall art\nUm world of art itself um I think that Richard stands apart in the sense that um he had already been active as early as the Nineteen fifties um varies quite successful um and you know it was kind of in some cases um seem to be kind of an enigma because he was\nYou know relatively successful but he still had many of the same obstacles um that many of other artist of colors um had at the time and probably continue to have um during this period um but um\nBut Richard was one of those shining stars um he had an early I mean he had early retrospective exhibitions as early as I think he was in his thirties [noise]\nUm one major one moment that took place in Nineteen Seventy one um but they had acquired a sculpture of his I'm entitled Iraq me ... years earlier um so I think one of the things that um\nThis um this particular exhibition demonstrate as how prolific I'm an artist such as Richard hunt is um and continues to be um so\n... and public art is a very particular kind of work he's huge pieces that huge outlast material and money obviously\nOn ... and Richard for you you have to admit I'm guessing be aware of where they're going to go and how do you how do you get yourself in that had space how do you think about where they're going to fit in space while you're there in your studio\n... let me go back to the beginning you know you\nI had space how do you think about where they're going to fit in space why they're in your state yeah\nWell let me go back to the beginning you know you mentioned the\nThe first major a commission that I had for this a mental health center in in a in a suburb of Chicago Illinois a ... an area\nUh that uh that ... is is kind of a um [noise] I'm a a\nA health care oasis you might say that on one side of the state dental health center is a Heinz veterans hospital across the street is Loyola university's medical center but anyway I mean that's one thing\nA then going back to\nI ended up doing that I mean people\nAre just are invited a asked to do commissioned works for either built environments yell like a\nOffice building a hotel or a hospital or in a park you know what I mean this is not like a light goes off and he said oh I Want to put a sculpture right right okay so it turns\nOut that uh the uh\nOffer of that commission came from uh the design architect for the project an architect named Walter net ... who was a partner at ... the firm Skidmore ... and Merrill level you heard of that line [laughter] I said right from the right and and\nSo um so now ah the thing is um [noise]\nUh Walter ... and his wife dawn Clark niche um\nWho is comptroller state of Illinois at the time and the two of them on their own or a avid collectors of art in particularly contemporary\nArt art of young up and comic artists aren't as important modern art or artists and I'm a ... Walter and his\nHad collected work of mine that was on exhibit while I was still a student at the\nWalter and his wife had\nCollected work of mine who was on exhibit while I was still a student at the art Institute\nWhich are to interrupt you but we've got just a minute left in the segment and I wanted to mention that uh one of our listeners treated that they have a wonderful Richard ... sculpture and the gossip the tower aspirations for lifting a commemorative park for Springfield village that's an historic\nAfrican American safe community in Augusta\nAnd I'm Sorry that we don't have the time to hear that story because there's so many players that go into\nA putting together a huge works like this [noise] um\nWell at least we got that point and that is the artist yes it's a lot of enablers\nYes an enabler like Shon yet showing you what do you think you know what are people going to see what do you hope they see when they walk away from the shell\nWell you know it's interesting that Richard mentioned um is you know families and in his ongoing interest in music because when we were installing the um\n\nAnd fresh air you'll hear from people who really make you think like astrophysicist Brian Greene explaining a scientific theory that our\nUniverse is just one of many and the image that I like to have in mind is imagine that our universe is like one slice of bread and a much grander cosmic loaf with the other slices of bread being other universes subject is too big for fresh air join us share this afternoon at three here on gp for\n[noise]\nSupport for G. P. B. comes from our monthly sustain yours\nAnd Ogle for University in Brookhaven working to make a private college education possible for more families in Georgia complete information on their new flagship fifty program is available at ... dot edu\nGB has been honored by the Georgia Associated Press media editors winning the top award for radio the pacemaker award we were also honored for specialized reporting best anchor and best newscast gp news stand with the facts they says on second thought I'm breaking oppressed\nPacemaker award we were also honored for best specialized reporting best anchor and best newscast jeep ... stand with the facts dishes on second thought I'm thinking of Prescott for decades restaurants considered Georgia only staring more trouble than they were worth\nBut always to aquaculture as a fledgling movement dedicated to putting more local oysters on the table I drink a lot about the eager coalition of people helping to cultivate these brainy by the house and his book a high low tide\nBrian ... is a local Easter booster and Cal owner of the restaurant Campbell house Mayan are far more desirable than harvesting wild oysters\nAnd the context of a restaurant that serving\nMoisture is at a raw bar um yeah I think for the most part that they are I mean we do get wild or assures that extraordinary that have the you know consistency is that are just shocking and surprising but\nUh for the most part are demographic has a better response to the culture to always just because you can control a new and all the variables but you can't control consistency to some degree and I think that people who are spending money like consistency they always have an email as well so\nIt's something that I think is probably just more attractive to them when they see it in a restaurant\nThe taste is there a difference in the case that you can discern\nWhat's your profiles change so much that you know if you took a a wild oyster and cultured always do that we're growing right next to each other and harvest them at the same time\nYou might taste some differences but you might not um you know the biggest difference is that a lot of these oysters that are being farmed are being farmed and floating bags in the wild stuff is sitting in the mud so depending on the makeup of that substrate you might get some like earthy or qualities\nOut of a wild oyster who's growing and the you know on the sea floor as opposed to something that's growing in a in a basket at the surface of the sea\nBefore you started serving oysters from joined Ted did any of your clients ask why they weren't on the menu\nUm we haven't had a ton of people ask where the Georgia or issues where when we first opened we did have a lot of people ask where the um the Florida boisterous war but now that that questions being answered I'm you know I'm kind of encouraging people to ask where are the Georgia or stirs\nAndre among the many characters that we need Justin ... when do you credit as the first person to farm George at least or is he now hatchery manager at the University of Georgia marine extension and Georgia sea grant so what has asked him to start farming oyster\nI'm here and I believe he was at a um an oyster roast and was inquiring about where the oysters came from knowing that you know Georgia does have a coast you know he he he will knew that [laughter] down from ... from Michigan\nAnd when he found out they were from away he was flabbergasted because you know he could just take one look at our marshes here and he could see um the the you know the relative lack of development and just you know it's it was obvious to him that this was prime oyster growing ground\nAll of those ... water men down there who works the hundred mile coast they watched him happy with the experimenting with it [noise] so how did he developed his techniques have oyster farm me\nWell his techniques were based on French method which is um used in in various ways it's actually called collecting spat which is the sponsor the oyster that was always just starts spawning in the late spring and do so over the summer\nAnd essentially he was doing what he does now and a hatchery but just out in the wild using plastic um to collect little tiny baby oysters and growing them until they got viable and then moving them into a bags where they could grow fat and healthy\nAnd this is essentially just adapting what the oyster does naturally have a a a wild voice or we'll just find whatever decent surface it can to glom onto even the smallest of you know microscopic grain of sand\nAnd what he was doing he was just calling to gather\nA method that was very well in news around the world and in this country already but because of the local culture hadn't been introduced to Georgia and was not being allowed to do to regulations he had to do this crazy round about way that\nAdded hours and hours I'm In into his work life but he was dedicated to do it because he he knows that the the Georgia oysters something that should return to prominence\nAnd he said he began with ... the name of his business was at that time spat king oysters [noise] mhm so we're not given all that effort what staff\nWill pay off for him ... originally was difficult because he had this like I said round about way he had to do that you know it was a little more time intensive than the what is becoming traditional agriculture methods\nThe path for him didn't work out for him because you know he lived in Savannah was wasn't living quite the Waterman life\nUm and had to walk away from it because of the different expenses\nBook reveals a whole system and not just the people who are harvesting or farming but the research shares the agriculture\nFrom it because of the different expenses\nYour book reveals a whole system and not just the people who are harvesting our farming but the research and here's the agriculture scientists who work collaboratively with harvester making this or did make the Georgia selfish business shellfish business competitive as it\nIs it really tense relationship in some places I'm Brian mentioned cameras caught up in Maine lobstermen and does his daddy and maintain the fisheries there is it pretty contentious relationship how does it work in Georgia I think you could\nDescribe it as contentious because he Waterman and there are a special breed um folks who work the water are tough and they're opinionated and they don't like to be pushed around and you know because they're dealing with a of a food business they have to deal with regulators right\nUm and then the then there are these you know the university researchers who are you know they have PHD's you know where these guys went to the school of hard knocks I'm\nSo they don't quite see eye to eye on everything um and so what that means is that someone working in extension like just the manly um has to kind of one tried slowly and speak a special language and and it I think it helps when\nFolks who are trying to eight in the industry have experience in the industry like Justin did\nAnd Brian for you a lot of your business I Would imagine is about the relationships with us from our farming is that correct\nYeah I mean it is for me um to me I I just feel like when you're\nWhen you're selling a food that people are eating raw I mean you you have to you should always be aware of the the risk of the dangers of eating raw ... any ... any sort of raw protein\nUm but you know I I've just always felt like we could eliminate some of the of Arab ... some of the risk variables by knowing who are buying from knowing how they how they know what type of steward they were how they treated their release\nUm and I just feel like the ... at this point in time that\nWe um you know and it's my opinion if not everybody's opinion but yeah I mean I think it will help has the best or Easter list in the city if not the southeast and I don't think that that's because I'm capable of picking up a phone or sending an email I think it's because we work with the best\nI imagine you could talk about wasters for a really long time just for hearing you I I could go for a little bit [laughter]\nI think ... have become this symbol of wealth and ... you know for lack of a better word that if you see a movie scene and they're trying to detect headed to fancy party at least\nWell ... and ... you know for lack of a better word that if you see a movie scene and they're trying to detect the fancy party at oysters on the half shell mhm\n[noise] that's one of the things that I struggle with because I Wish that it was a a food source that was not alienating from up of a price standpoint I you know hopefully that something that that we can sort of work through as the industry gets a little bit more mature\nAnd we're looking for ways to use a use or stirs differently but yeah I mean you know it's one of the biggest difference between ... and culture to always theirs is the fact that you do have to make a\nPretty large investment and equipment and see that and those sorts of tore items and it's not without a a considerable start up costs\nAnd remind me makes me think of that Irish satirist Jonathan ... he was a bold man that first eight and ... and I think in twenty eight and we can safely say he was a ... man that first farmed and oyster\nAnd Jay this revival surely didn't come easily and at that easy to revival how far along is that where do you think that revival of the oyster farming along the Georgia coast is now\nI think you can say that the the the a large of a boom is is set to begin\nUm and it's just waiting on some regulations to be rewritten the DNR is moving slowly and I think someone say far too slowly and changing um some of the regulations that would allow oyster farmers", "show_name": "On Second Thought", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "18"}
