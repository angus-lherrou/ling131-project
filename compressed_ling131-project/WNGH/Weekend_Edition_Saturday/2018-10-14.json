Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors over the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country\nBut this year the geo Pete is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down\nHe Jessica highly so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors they haven't\nReally good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them\nWhat states are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of\nPickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida's always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think are really close race still\nNext door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is\nChanging has it changed enough that's a really big question and then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt um Nevada in Ohio there's we're always sort of toss ups but then it didn't seem real chances to flip some places are going to really ruby red territory\nKansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma both of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding and you know even if you're a Republican voter\nGoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally\nHe only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Marilyn's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip it said in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican and parents Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the coal gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants in the jails the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that cats from member station WNYC report\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned into a political firestorm\nMe she was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement agency pays the county to house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week\nOne of them call Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nBecause you'd night you can you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get down here in uh in county we can do what we really are in North Jersey after nearly\nOne of the better but if we can get things back down here and I think county we can we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five ten sours Hudson County voted to end the ice contract but not until twenty twenty that way to counter you would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nThe all democratic board a free holders as the county legislators in New Jersey or known a short residents that action would be taken here's Anthony Romano\nIs a strong possibility we will say that as if\nIt's not just rhetoric across the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice\nIn Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants and didn't Atlanta the mayor issued an executive order to stop accepting ice detainees but all of this is not happening without pushback\nHe liked it I Can't\nEven balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep her taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences Ryan ... represents immigrants at the jail pro bono\nFamilies and lawyers and their community are here and the separation from those resources is critical to enabling detainees actually win their cases remain permanently and the United states or have released on bond\nBrewer says the detainees should be allowed to stay in New Jersey near their families and lawyers unlike in other parts of the country immigrants jailed in Hudson County or a eligible for free legal representation\nThe free holders did agree to try to improve conditions for immigrants before the end of the contract the gel has been plagued by problems suicides poor medical care bad food several former detainees testified at the hearing last week with\n... twenty five year old from Cuba said he was raped twice by other detainees by the gel director who was also at the meeting said he

Donald Trump tweeted yesterday Obama campaigned with Jay Z and Bruce Springsteen well Hurricane Sandy victims are still ... decimated by Sandy wrong\nAnd of course Sandy made landfall a week prior and President Obama and Mitt Romney both did suspend their campaigning wallet hit but we like to go back to the historical record the Twitter record for Trump versus Trump tweets if there is indeed a tweet for everything [noise] um do you expect him to be in front of the\nCameras as much as he was this past week because he sure did seem a lot more active um than ever and his media interactions\nI think he probably will I think his instinct is to flood the zone be ubiquitous try to dominate the media narrative\nSomething happened last week that might have shook him up which is the cable networks including Fox stopped taking his rallies live they played clips instead and he can't have been too happy about that especially while he's got a top\nPerformer Fox television\nHis rallies live they played clips instead and he can't have been too happy about that especially well he's got a top\nPerformer Fox television executive bill shine in the White House now is the communications director but he has a lot of tools with which he can dominate the media narrative\nHe has those impromptu press conferences impromptu press conferences on the south lawn is he's going to the helicopter he's given interviews to New York magazine and time sixty minutes tonight he\nI'm joy all Snyder with these headlines the timing is not yet clear but at the White House says President Trump is planning to visit Florida and Georgia early this week\nHurricane Michael is now being blamed for killing at least Fifteen people there are fears that number will rise as rescuers if you have to read some of the hardest hit areas\nThe remnants of hurricane Leslie causing problems in Portugal strong winds and heavy rain from Leslie have uprooted trees smash store windows leaving behind widespread power outages\nAnd a major league baseball the Houston Astros have taken the opening game of the American league championship series beating Boston Red Sox last night came to us today financially series between Los Angeles Dodgers and the Milwaukee Brewers tied game apiece game three us tomorrow\nOn trial Snyder NPR News Culver City California [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build them or just in Des quotable world learn more at age eight W.

Navarro utility crews are working to restore power to customers from the Florida Panhandle\nThis is weekend\nEDITION from NPR News I'm Luke ... Navarro\nUtility crews are working to restore power to customers from the Florida Panhandle to Virginia in the aftermath of hurricane Michael officials are warning it could take weeks in some areas\nAs we see more and more powerful storms hitting us it has many thinking about how to make the nation's power grid more resilient NPR's Jeff Brady reports\nIn Panama City Florida right now this is a common than\nLucky to have them or using gas powered generator until utility crews they sell the down holes\nAnd wires and restored their electricity say county emergency services chief mark Bowe and says that will be a long slog this\nElectrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says Scott Aaron Senate the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do restoration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about one in ten said they'd accepted twenty percent increase\nBut fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\n... and you're right it can actually be much more we can take like right now and ... and an overhead wire\nSays in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids\n... says and flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient\nOne thing McNamara would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries at places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to be finished the joint chiefs of ensuring that pretty quiet restructuring general population and keep the lights and even if the broader\nMcNamara was lead author of a twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change\nThat's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost us all fuel industries Jeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's election closed in Florida we know Florida as a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season are computer covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\nBy driving so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago using a lot of storms come through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nThing Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland, Mississippi looked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd and all of the associated\nDestructive miss that kind of turns wants kind of lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of many signs of human habitation and construction new trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nLet's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson and a charismatic mayor of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Ron dissent is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of us\nUh of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat and ... is running for governor against Ron dissent is the former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida you know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns [noise]\nWe can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott a Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led to the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over but both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee and there but it was hit pretty hard it was hit yeah a ...\nTallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent round the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly\nIn in one case actually change sewing trees away [laughter] and\nMoving debris really so he's changed on your trees [laughter] well he he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again to understand that like the entire pain\nWill be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nShort we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle and meals impossible now because you can't get a hold of half you know eating or ... of the people\nThat's political as mark ... joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on

school to hire a woman as a full time football coach with the U.S from member station WBHM GBH spent a day with Kelly bouncing and the big green and brought us a story\nSome of Kelly Brown since earliest memories or Saturday afternoons with her dad watching the University of Miami Hurricanes play football those players were her childhood heroes she even collected their football cards\nI was

try\nShe played youth football but in the fall of two thousand four when she tried to join her high school team in northern Virginia she was told no they wouldn't even let her try out was that maybe she could come on as a kicker\nNothing against ... but I Want it to play I wanted to have people I wanted to be a part of of every facet of it\nBefore her senior year round and tried one last time to convince the football coach to give her a shot\nA hit list and I'm going into the air out here I don't have you ever put me on the field and land the football team and laugh at me\nEven though she never got to play in high school grounds in they didn't give up\nShe played free safety wide receiver and running back for the D.C DeVos of the women's football alliance from twenty to twenty Seventeen and wants to world championships with team usa women's football\nBronson also spent three seasons coaching high school football and insurance last year with the New York jets this summer she took her coaching gig at the manning passing academy procedures football clinic\nAnd this was the first year the academy admitted female players but it's even who oversees coaches at the academy want it to recruit women to work with those players he hired grounds and she stood out immediately\nOf the people in the field Kelly had really struck me as highly highly organized passionate about what she was doing she was very very meticulous in terms of the practice plan I asked her and she's very confident\nStevens is also the head coach at Dartmouth College he invited brown since the intern with the big green during the pre season and after seeing how well she quit with everyone he made a special announcement that that scene captured on video\nAnd very very impressed so impressed with her that like draw er physician with us this year [noise]\nHired her as the offensive quality control coach it's an entry level job which is the first woman to do it at this level and to even say she's proven she deserved the spot\nShe's made played more football a lot of people that are coaching uh in in the NFL or at the college level and to me that's relevant she understands the sport [noise]\nOn the field at Dartmouth rounds in his everywhere at once whether it's helping special tombs taking foreign drills with a wide receivers forgetting the scouts in different set up she's always on the\nMove\nTo the thoughts on the wing of\nA true players coach she cracks jokes with the team cheering when they do well in correcting them when they needed junior wide receiver ... players knew right away they wanted her to stick around and encourage coach Stevens to make the higher immediately we knew it\nCorrecting them when they [noise] junior wide receiver random tests were such players knew right away they wanted her to stick around and encourage coach Stevens to make the higher\nImmediately we knew if we can really see ourselves without her a practice every single day just because of the energy and ... the game\nBronson loves football and she wants more girls and women to be accepted in the game like she finally has been the most proud to be the first woman who's a fulltime division one football coach her bigger focus is on not being blessed\nAll this time we've thought that women didn't have a place and for all they do for me that to me is the headline that's more important than the first female so hey that's cool but is it worth it and it actually going to a vote change then that's the part that to me is the one that should be focused on\nBut for right
