Kavanaugh seems to be on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we will come and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian Bussey forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh wars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nSo I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it then look to possible that they she confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise] um and also for you even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all information out there you want to first of all and make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of that 'cause she was so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople there basically to his of cooperation were her therapy\nBasically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople there basically to his cooperation were her therapists notes which had seemed to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she she found Christian buzz you forward a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and is an inherently difficult crime because you know some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you'd end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in the U.S [laughter] neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you don't inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence [noise]\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court see it as very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing\nI was gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise]\nUm it's not the same as being put in a

his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Tim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily their head or of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is\nThe extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump use a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald ... over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that if Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches I think that release\nManhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that if Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you that you can recognize and that may be people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\n[noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little

point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia and twenty sixteen [noise] can the argument being made that senator mantra news just reflecting the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia [noise]\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabinet people mostly most people supported Kevin here however um\nI think he did it entirely politically because he's up for re election in thirty days and heat kids under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician is that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nCars and I did it to him yesterday on\nThursday will tell tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office like a day and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat

both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams aren't the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief fishing the red Sox

pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but
