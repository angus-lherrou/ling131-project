edition with special coverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference and was about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people are injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning I live\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well let me know is\nThat eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers\nThe names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as a day goes by of course the next step is funerals memorial services and we'll be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nIn yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened and what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] this into context for us Sarah ... there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern great\nI mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and\nUm while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning great um\nI went to the scene this morning\nIt was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue of to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun you know laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner [noise]\nUm and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last\nThis neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nOr they mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help stay on leaves a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now [noise]\nIncredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nI'm as something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the synagogue the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nI'm the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks worth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years thing of Texas that actively carry out that's that sentence this button unless the president is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal um relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a\n... and said that this is he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm a ... of course you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to read reduced is kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it uh ... what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nIn these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so um\nPeople are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for crimes that they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce it\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community [noise]\nI'm In this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant\nUh motives that tells us something about why this might have happened again that still under

the state to the county to the local was something that we should all be proud of\nThe fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics were asked to see\nOur medics deciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from our surrounding counties\nThe federal agents in this state troopers and the county officers all working together in order to be able to make sure an episode\nThey will forever

synagogue and we're joined now by Sarah McCammon again who is in Pittsburgh\nSome people might be reminded of how they felt after the Parkland shootings maybe that would have an effect\nI'm One of the effects that I think this will have as the pipe bomb story had is that\nIt makes it harder for the president took control the narrative because we're not talking about cabinet and the caravan as much as we're talking about the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter and he has actually complained about that he said that\nHe lived in that in momentum and now this bomb thing happened and that's all

[noise] well we expect to say opt\nGo before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five\nWell we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces and then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his van and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrest\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is when I Lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail I understand you suddenly coworkers including one who was in that town [noise]\nYet Deborah ... was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nThat's my last Hitler\nBe eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking much Sandler he loves Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nAnd That's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre me thank you so much thank you lose them\n\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority [noise]\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race we\nTalk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent whites me very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nVoters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nWell I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that they're they're white and it was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say white but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days and Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so there is also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color where you had legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago but white voters also hear the racial implications of that\nAnd so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition
