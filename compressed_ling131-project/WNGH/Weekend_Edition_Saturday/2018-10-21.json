Arabia is\nCruz's dot com this weekend edition from NPR News I'm new to Garcia Navarro\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since the Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate and assemble that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region and so being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition and the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a boat or Saudi Arabia and the un king Solomon of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion on may in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those members of civil society\n[laughter] you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they looked like the hero and the story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man driven and of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined ugly\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed Jamal ... she's a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they are facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that uh they need the\nSome sort of economic relief they are facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated got\nA they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange they need investment that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the Iowa or to well I was very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nAnd and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was best not more money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of why\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very nicely blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been heading on this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these officials better showman than Mexican Government said that they are to me and if it at least they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours off everything and these officials started what I had seen all these years four years\nOf the ... is that all the ... is our ally is not to its ally so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is uh\nIs that all the official better showing you sound like it's not true its ally [noise] so tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and for the police not jaws where not these about why do I ... that night every minute\nSo they knew the federal government and the police not just is\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up all these white chasing the students\nScenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that that [noise] so the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students kills [noise]\nWell their students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police\nThey state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that two bosses where they were dressed birth dating inside to the CD [noise]\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to that brought this to Mexico City so they went to the station\nDay to do that you both us and when their students were trying to escape on board will be spy bosses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staple east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them [noise] they they're all ... of that back to Boston is from ... to buses disappeared all the forty three students [noise]\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students who are on this plus has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this these wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling by bus is\nThat that a good why just to know so these two bosses\nDo this we're targeting inside bus is\nThat that a good why just to\nKnow so these two versus\nWhat exactly they are two bosses that the army and if the police it starts to monitor it seems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do versus what students were traveling from their school to why why so\nWhat I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nOr a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss\nSecret compartment as harrowing to me as a harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students the the ... or the army and if the police\nThey knew it so these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these guys that

I Try and keep that in other countries\nWould have to agree to during that say it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\n[noise] that's the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n[noise]\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump ... turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats that any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin\nTwo states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottles\n[noise] and it's this tuition would reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nI think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the Tuesday to the you mentioned the Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those\nTo insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned the Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they are talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that sitting as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to raise taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how the Democratic tax increases\nHave chased a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here if the elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night massacre\nPresident Nixon had an ended the Justice Department having let go of his attorney general deputy attorney general and the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal\nPresident Trump is vocally frustrated with Robert Mueller's investigation so could it happen again here's Ron Elving NPR senior editor and correspondent with the story of the Saturday Night massacre it's why we call him professor on\nThe Democratic National

even larger story began to trickle out thanks to to Washington Post reporters who pursued it when few others were paying much attention Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\nNixon was re elected in a

I. racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century they're drawing people together a through making them feel shed hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of ...\nAnd through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nSo concerned do you I mean I'm hearing a real noticed concern um that identity um and the politics around it it has been weaponized and and it's certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing losing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that you base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nHe asked the question is whether you can do that with our boat you cold rightly weaponize identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nDemocracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is polite said bind me thinking identity thank you very much thank you very much\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to to use in the complete cookbook for a young chef\nTV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to the youth and the complete cookbook for young chef NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef as she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nEight year old Lucy Gray is wide eyed and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in\nChief of the night she good to meet you were a little excited us very\nLoosely likes to cook and has helped make some meals her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself\nThe cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a she takes up these old Lucy decides to taste it\n[laughter] at one point while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nPaul's one table\nToo that's at AT T S P which is the abbreviation for peace and this is one capital T that the table and let me ask you something mind at the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yes recall it\nDecoding kitchen speak there's so many words and these recipes that you just don't know until you've cooked aren't so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment to instructions on how to measure men's and chop this recipe calls for a chopped onion the first it has to repeal\n[noise] responsible [noise]\nLike let's say the cookbook emphasize the safety", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "21"}
