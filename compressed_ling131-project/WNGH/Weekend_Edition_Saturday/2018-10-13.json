yeah it's good to be here tell us about your faith which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I'd really known as far as religion goes I I Believe in most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report [noise]\nBecause I was reading about these parishes that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you adhere to the joke about you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion and then I didn't learn honestly until\nRecently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense\nWhat I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know

buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years\nPushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse that was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care [noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with because of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months\nUm since moving to a new area and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of some of these new stories I've been exploring other

wanting to talk to you [noise] when someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it oh not\nAt all not at I look forward to it that my mother is incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patches she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a rider we practice that I still have now but they're right on the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we face up to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television is on a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around on a chain she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just I think started to get progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to give progressive we worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\n[noise] yeah it's a very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the ... that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies\nSeems that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things I just want to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I thing led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAn individual you have started to start as a way of attempting to hide and symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of veer between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police I was about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah [laughter] then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overuse broke from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to um casinos and\nIt was hard to write about they're harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim and one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi and so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there is a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand half white\nThe money that we are able to make we aren't able to keep right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to when I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think there's something that I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about their physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse\nThe addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nI Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment\nComing full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true\nBut I Know I'm a writer Norman American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nCare say

vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting\nYeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow
