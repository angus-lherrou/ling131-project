cities were supposed to die out\nThe proliferation of the automobile and everyone would move to the suburbs and never come back the decline of urban manufacturing\nThe city itself would decline and then there's all the crime and noise pollution and chaos cities are known for who on earth would ever want to live in any city\nAs it turns out just about everyone we're in the middle of an historic and holy ... predicted rise in terms of ... happening here in America and all over the world\nOne problem many of our cities are old which means they're not exactly optimized for the twenty first century and it's not so easy to retrofit an entire city so building a new city for the twenty first century and beyond from scratch\nOur mission is to use technology to really redefined urban life and the twenty first century\nToday on freakonomics radio look at the city of the future with a man who's been rebuilding New York city for the past few decades man [noise] some people call a modern day

of every ...\nHere's your house [noise]\n\nIf you happen to live in New York City is I Do there's a name it's been routinely popping up for a few decades now always attached to interesting and often controversial project I'm Dan doctor off but don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name but his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states\nGrew up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but he settled in in his wife started raising their family here\nHe worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces who finds the urban bridges too good to pass up\nThis went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York hot to host the Olympics and the eventually that that idea became a bit of a movement it drew\nThe attention of Mike Bloomberg what the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh I don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less being there which says you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg\nPresident apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich but voters\nWell voters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal\nSmart self made fiercely pragmatic and he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about he was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterated in the September eleventh terrorist attack\nLess than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred and eighth mayor\nBloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other neophyte to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDan doctor off did that job for six years\nEvent asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nAnd Bloomberg was finally done being mayor into thousands Thirteen after squeezing out a third term despite a pre existing two term limit he considered running for president he considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and all you know it's a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't want to go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today a CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nThe un doctor off was unknown quiet\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money a recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time\nAnd you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nA you've got delayed you wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursued pursued pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote sounds pretty nutty doesn't it you know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they used the deadlines at the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics created\nSort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it you know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite the science of what kind of region will benefit from\nIt all depends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision\nTo get massive reads owning done in time et cetera et cetera [noise] now the second question you asked was are we better\nThe fish and to get massive reads owning done in time et cetera et cetera now the second question you asked was or we better off having now one and there I think the answer is no because I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more stuff done for ...\nAnd it sounded as music to my ears\nSeven also in Georgia the four seasons aren't summer fall winter and spring it's football spring football recruiting and\nSigning day I'm John Nelson a GB sports every Friday I traveled a steak covering high school football games for GB TV but there's still a lot to talk about and joined me for the ball findings in

who's really in charge of snap judgment storytelling was the beach [noise]\nAfternoon at one time GDP [noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ... damn doctor off\nStarted his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York who then joined the Bloomberg administration helped New York recover from the nine eleven attack who then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York\nThat exists today one of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr Austin is chairman and president\nShed I was just curious about the ... the why ... why did\nYork City need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a\nShed I'm just curious about the the why ... why did in New York City need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts fiend at least [laughter]\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back\nTo when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this\nArea on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for one it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem\nThat led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible both pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer something yes\nThat's exactly right it's like a transformers really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters [noise]\nFrom what I can gather to shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage the big city like New York\nA great way of saying it you know another way of expressing as cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan to the the\nOther it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital\nMight be some ground rules et cetera that enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends began to change I think that is a very different notion of a cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors the high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and\nYou are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me and\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble and the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down\nAnd the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent on ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what\nThe two young guys who had basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and a manatee\nI Will confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because the government is really hard um\nAnd that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard um and just getting anything done often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system\nAnd basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivized firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nView was that financial incentives uh two or companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nAnd we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been the bride companies to stay or bribe companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user and so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just\nUltimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world and it was sort of this optimistic sense that produced this incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that\nMost places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became you know you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I
