P. B. S. W. A. G. P. H. D. rural part of Georgia Public broadcasting radio network [noise]\nLast week we were talking to the journalist Franklin for about his latest book world without mind the existential threat of being ...\nMy argument is against the big technology companies which really are racing to expand into every ... of our lives\nWe spoke with for a year ago his book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nThat's since become relevant just because they fired a respect for his critic of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation underwriting of it\nIt it actually does it feel good because New America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavowed them when they've been so nice to me but this does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired\nHis name is Barry Lynn and he ran some make all the open markets program there I'm very active opponent of monopoly in a very vociferous critic of ah of Google\nOr used to have an affiliation with the New America foundation where we were kicked out of New America\nThis week on freakonomics radio we tell the rest of that messy story at\nPoint did Google or any fun\nAnd this week on freakonomics radio we tell the rest of that messy story at no point did Google or any ...\nAnd we look at how corporations use ... to shape the public debate and how that can go terribly wrong\n[noise]\n\nIt's freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise]\nHere's your house\nVery Lynn started out as journalists I worked in Venezuela and in Peru as a foreign correspondent and then after that I rent a magazine called global business magazine we should say it was a pro business magazine [noise] we were a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses\nSo we had a real inside look at how global as Asian actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to lend crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation and its project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nWe got the work going and we did it with\nIncreasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty sixteen\nWe had a number of folks on the hill starting to understand that indeed America has a monopoly problem and the first person who sort of really reached out and said\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem today in America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problem since a series of speeches that FDR gave in the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms\nAnd states to the monopoly problem since a series of speeches that FDR gave the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platforms that lots of companies depend on for survival but Google apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with as small companies said that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition\nAnd she said you know this is it's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power\nThat at least two concentrations of wealth and concentrations of will lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market Institute but also it's apparent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies and risks of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who's now president and CEO of New America\nWhat convinced me to\nLeave Princeton and and the head of New America which was a big move 'cause I had a wonderful position at at Princeton or was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debates about our\nFuture and the digital age but as Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America were not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing some of our attention on the platform unarmed places and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the question is why is um [noise]\nWho was our work a new American problematic for Google Google ... of Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the boards at Google was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years she stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn for years\nAnd it's renamed parent company alphabet for several years he stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also a CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation so did Google itself between Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this is the relationships that goes back to the very early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as Lynn's critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google's domination\nEuropean antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website it congratulated European regulators forgiving Google such a good spanking and urged American regulators do the same\nYeah we released this statement in support of the decision and Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty ninth I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times\nHeadline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision to reconsider and if it could not be reconsidered I asked for more time I was told that neither of those was possible\nThe writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn's open markets Institute told us simpler version of events he made it clear that lens statement about the European regulators decision\nThis was something that was a bit too far for Google and New America was very generous than supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly are outraged by their treatment of very\nAnd New America was very generous than supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly are outraged by the treatment of very and I can't resigned from New America because I'm not affiliated with them and not to be any money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nI pledge to make completely available to the public all of the grant making we do the evaluations of the grants that we make\nI Want to invite in outside experts as well and I would want to find ways in which to organize the foundations efforts to seek out the most severe critics of what we were doing in order to try to learn the most in order to give grants away to greater effect\nAnd uh I'd like to see possibly experimentation with a form of foundation peer review and which you know an effort analogous to what happens in academia happens within the foundation world\nIt would be surprising if the philanthropic outfits of corporations were\nPurely altruistic corporation seek to advance their own interest especially in their lobbying quite possibly often and their philanthropy\nI'm trying to stimulate people to be morally awake and in the same moment to get people to consider what type of public policies are frameworks to governance structure our collective lives which is a moral and philosophical question\nWas the Stanford political scientist Robert ... we also heard from Anne Marie

over her face\nThat's ludicrous it would be to lose a golf tournament standing on the last the with the three shot lead\nIt would require a grotesque combination of decisions and actions\nThat is such a horrific where some people\nDon't even like to say it loud we're not one of those people yeah there's lots of different ways people can choke ... and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching ray\n[noise]\nIf we're going to talk about choking we probably need to bring in some psychologists\n... and I'm a professor of psychology at Florida State university here in Tallahassee, Florida Anders\nEricson pioneer of deliberate practice movement and the ten thousand hours idea have been studying expert performers for years\nBallet dancers gymnast and all sorts of athletes we've looked at chess experts surgeons doctors teachers musicians taxi drivers recreational activities like goals and even there is some research on on scientists\nDefined choking for me as you see it\nThe drivers recreational activities like goals and even there is some research on on scientists\nDefined choking for me as you see it\n[noise] or choking to me is is actually somebody who cramps up an an an in some ways becomes unable to really act and appropriately in the situation or were accent a very decreased performance\nI've defined choking as worst performance then you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation and that's the on by luck I Am a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at the University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\nSo I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people engage in regularly and we're we're\nMost likely to choke I really think that any situation where there's expectations for success can cause choking and it doesn't have to be you know the Olympic Games that can be when you're parallel parking and people around you are watching rate or if you're in an elevator and\nYou're trying to figure out whether you're going to say something to that person [laughter] you know we talk about these ethics moments of cocaine but it's a desire to perform at our best and situations in which were evaluated happening constantly\nGive me a little bit on the characteristics of those who are more and less prone to choke what about high IQ versus low IQ\nIn my research and in others we've shown perhaps counter intuitively that individuals who have the most ability to focus them most working memory that most flew an intelligence or actually more prone to perform poorly under stress and the idea is that\nIf you normally devote lots of cognitive resources to what you're doing and being in a pressure filled situation robs uses resources you can't perform as well\nYou just described all the reasons why I'm not very good at playing golf under pressure [laughter] and then let me just ask you one more kind of summary about surroundings um talk about

subconsciously influenced by the home crowd and may make one or two key calls in home teams favor\nThe research also showed that on balance athletes themselves do not perform better in front of the home crowd room\nWe see on ... tells us that\nFriendly faces may actually create pressure filled situations you have to wonder if some dimension they might perform even worse\nFreakonomics radio is

P. B.\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nWhen psychologist think about choking under pressure they consider a variety of thought processes that may be subtle hard to measure ...\nLook at choking differently\nSaid that you would have paid me a million dollar\nIf I give the best interview of the week\n... is an economist at the University of California San Diego that would have made me very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this\nWhen we look at the incentives in comics we think about two ways in which it's going to affect us the first is that you felt pay you more you'll put more effort into task and the second to some\nNews that more effort will lead to better performance and that's not necessarily true and that's the part of choking might be that I can push you so much to to try so hard to do will actually backfire you'll eat perform worse\nBeen easy co authored one of the foundational economics papers I'm choking it's called large steaks and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including India\nReason we wanted to go to India is that over there are money can go a long way so we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offered them up to six months' salary in our experiment if they did perfectly well\nYeah in which the daily wage was so low that we could offer them up to six months' salary in our experiment if they did perfectly well\nEach participant completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead ... creative one was for example to pack pieces of metal in to input books in an efficient way\nSome tasks we're cognitive and memory game in which I Would read up numbers you listen to me and then at some point do say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic\nThrowing a dark like candy bowls so balls or on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars\nAnd ten daughter was about what they made in the months over there I open to to agree with me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make you\nWho work much harder rides and the question was are you going to be better actually when you were Carter\nAs can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics the higher pay leads to more effort and more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nSo the findings were striking UC reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in lower success rate when the incentives were really high\nFor the three digit memory game roughly forty percent of the participants succeeded under low incentives under high incentives the success rate which is twenty percent of the dark ballgame the success rate under low incentives was ten percent and runs seven percent under high incentives for the metal packing game\nUnder low incentives twenty five percent of the participants succeeded under high incentives nobody's succeeded or put another way at least twenty five percent of them choked\nActually were a bit surprised by this experiment because we included tasks in which we expected that effort will it will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school it was\nI served in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure\nSo can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks make us succumb to pressure they ran some more experiments at MIT using students as their research subjects some experiments involved simple manual tasks like punching alternating keyboard keys as fast as possible\nIt's really something that you know if you're doing for long enough it's boring so he felt pay you more you'll try may be harder and we believed it more effort will actually increase your performance\nOther tasks we're more cognitive like adding numbers and ...\nWhen you think about ... ... probably reach your ultimate behavior to your best soon and very fast and now he's been really really making it high incentives you might actually start being you know distracted\nOnce again there were low and high incentive versions of each task since a dollar doesn't go far in Massachusetts as it doesn't India the rewards here we're up to thirty dollars for the low incentive experiments and up to three hundred dollars for the high\nSo what we found is that for their keep pressing task when you increase the incentives from up two sets of goes up to three hundred dollars they\nSweet for about a forty percent succeeding to eighty percent succeeding on the other end when you have to add up numbers the more cognitive one we see a sharp decrease from sixty five percent to forty percent\n[noise] so when you actually have to put some cognitive effort into this get him to the incentive to be ridiculously high could actually be a bad idea\n[noise]\nThis would seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves some thinking we're more susceptible to choke core probably heard from a lot of people over the years coaches teachers and counsellors of all sorts you are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out of the way\nBut that's obviously harder than it sounds so how can you do that how can you prepare yourself to not crumble\nUnder the very circumstances that matter most [noise]\nHow do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most\nHow do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic\nSee on by luck again going back to her Gulf experiments so we investigated whether going quicker for example um might help eliminate poor performance under pressure or I'm having one key swing thought that encapsulates your entire stroke\nMight be better um and we showed that some of that was successful and it leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess of your buddy up on on the back now you can say hey that was a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great said so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else can you tell us about in this domain at least I'm learning to joke with\nWe also showed that getting used to this type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes with performance can be helpful so really inoculated yourself against the high pressure situations you see this with students who practice taking time pass a\nYou see this with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions that are going to perform under and you even see this if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players used to what it's going to feel like to be in that big stadium\nUm and this is true in\nReally big important situations but it's it's also true in those little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it well people are watching you know um and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to the kinds of all eyes on you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "20"}
