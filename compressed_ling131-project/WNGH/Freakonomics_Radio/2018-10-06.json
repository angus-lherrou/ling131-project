grade daughter that's just moved to exploit that fight started and I hit her as hard as I can and she actually fell down I have an eight year old son there's no way I'd let them play\nMaybe you are an obsessive sports fan\nMore maybe more casual fan and you follow just a couple of sports teams and radio pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV [noise]\nWhichever the case when you do see those athletes\nIt's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context\nUnder extraordinary pressure\nFocused on highly specialized task has zero to do with daily life or at least your daily life\nBut is that who those people really are I think it's so good at this thing they do\nWhen you see them on TV all you're seeing the outcome or the input and\nUnderstand that elite athletes represent some magical combination of talent and determination but what about said\nI I yes absolutely I think in a ton of luck involved\nWith Shawn Johnson than American gymnast to one limping gold medal in many other top honors\nThe miracle ... kind of equation and a half a equal to ...\nAmerican gymnast to one elliptical metal and many other top honors\nI like the miracle not kind of equation and a half a equal the perfect answer I mean you you can't get hurt me healthy you can't have that flew on the wrong day yet to find the right ... city of Fort at all these random things and\nWhen you get all the people who fit that equation\nNot left as many people so I guess I was just the best of\nThe very few that equation\nToday I'm thinking on the radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war and colonizing two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\nOf athletic countries\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise San Francisco forty niners and how they have a gun to recover from a debilitating losing streak\nBut when you lose the game a lot of noise happens when you lose to a town happens usually three is like Armageddon I'm\nTrying not in today's episode coming an athlete\nTime to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened [noise]\nHow scientific is the process of predictable\nLook at a number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both superstar athletes will look at will determination\nI did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night until I was throwing up\nAnd the mental aspect of this most physical pursuits well I think the mind is is as big of a separate or\nUm for professional athletes as any physical tools will hear stories of opportunities gained and lost in Nineteen eighty one it was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues\nAs of two thousand eight teams to seven point eight per se and we'll hear one story it's almost too good to be true they say hey you\nAre blowing up on Twitter you bought a voyage Graham you know your everywhere and you just have no idea\n\nHis freakonomics radio show that a lower back inside of everything [noise]\nHere's your house even\nWhen you see an elite performer in any field um sports or music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question is how they get so that so much of that ability where they born\nHow much is attributable to the hard work can practice\nIs a debate been going on probably forever nature versus nurture fraud talent versus what's called deliberate practice we've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become great at just about anything [noise] too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious that\nBecome great at anything\nYou need both talent in lots of each but even that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because ... success like any success and leaving\nIt's what you might call multi factorial [noise]\nA lot of input and a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods\nYou really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also ended up identical as much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe\nReal life is more nuanced and then\nAlso more interesting\nSoul drugs grew up in a Marcy project to a single mother\nIt's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL now he is I\nMultiply multimillionaire married to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today so why don't we set it up so that all young men\nMust sell drugs when their kids and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York I mean she had a great\nTalent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of luck like he happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend and Smith showing them like that is like a lot of luck\nProbably a a great deal of law like he happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in Smith show on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me and I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happened that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nShould be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around it seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprised to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star\nYes you are and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete are going to be the best get on your team\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more ah I played back yard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits\nPassed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve let it we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about a hundred times more likely than a random boy to also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals in ...\nOh man well my ... my life has literally than family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar athletes they both come from very athletic family\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shipped friend who was one to Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and next surgeries and everything but she still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up\nStill such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up\nUm had played more different sports when they were younger spent more time in self structured or unstructured soccer play when they were younger but not more time in deliberately structured soccer training\nOnly by age twenty two did they start playing fewer sports and spending more time and structured soccer the athletes who plateaued at lower levels so this sort of less structured development\n[noise] um [noise] and turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become like [noise] okay\nWhat if you are a young athlete or the parent of on [noise] and your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athlete\nBut rather to get into ... university [noise] like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise] you know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that Steve Love it my freakonomics friend and coauthor he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nBut my calculation about ... four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools have so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it [noise]\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nOkay that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\n[noise] have a fencing thing the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nAnd each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says eBay there's Sabre list foil and there's male female fancy\nAnd given that relatively ...\nIt's quite a few slots to fill there's three different blade says eBay there's Sabre list foil and there's male female fair to end given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers\nSo it's something like six or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors end up being college ... about saying they get scholarships but that\nThey're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing how much does limit think fencing increases your chances from that point four percent baseline\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else costs than something like Fifteen fold we should say here that college admissions being what they are\nFencing doesn't necessarily increase your Kansas all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to school for kid about soccer and basketball and football there's something like\nThree hundred thousand kids\nPlaying high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be college soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned to defense or just love it\nI actually won and us so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and he fences at a really good club in Chicago and\nThat it knows grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know everybody else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio\nThe story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro\nApparently counted against him if he had played at Kentucky or do\nYou would have been a time to address\nProblem was he played at Harvard we'll be right back\nFreakonomics radio is supported by targeted presenting future at heart and new podcast that explores

P. B. O. O. [noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ... [noise] as we've\nBeen hearing a lot of inputs to go into the production of an elite athlete and Palin's drives the right kind of practice maybe a parent or to to get you to the ring to the gym or the track at five AM and as Shawn Johnson told us earlier he might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day yet to find the right coach Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up on my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of freak occurrence\nYou have to find the right coach Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of this freak occurrence Franco was Chinese born and raised Chinese um when he was three years old and he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast\nAnd he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians there were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson had started her training at different to them and I loved it it was awesome but chow my coach that took me to impacts opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was really really blessed to fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean\nGiven today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me safe and I am forever grateful for that [noise]\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether to bad luck\nFor through something much more concrete like lack of money\nOver the past decade youth sports economy has doubled its more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nTo play as much as it just scares me because it's become so much for business owners of itself and less about\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy and he's been a picture in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIf a tournament in California this we go next week and you go about it after that it's Texas and I don't understand oh two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\nYou you know the theme of economic\nI don't understand how two working parents could ever afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm\nAt the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor heaven play him\nI think there's that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to bear itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nAnd so I remember missing a couple of Thanksgiving dinners um you know not being able to drive out to my sister's house for Christmas and I remember my family kind of being like what the hell if I you know why are you suddenly neglecting not so much and uh\nI I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need to make these sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nIn the high school you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share\nI didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing football baseball you know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime like Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends are you having a good time at the beach and and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably at high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominique Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nIn college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was Mm do that\nThen in college I wanted to ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that that course slows gonna make it very difficult for you to make a top practices\nTheir labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like no not going to do that\nSo instead you did was it American studies yeah and that American studies when journalism ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing\nFootball now I um I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nFor football and I fail to say once I got to the late then I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you give it up through the course of your life\n[noise]\nYou shouldn't feel too sorry for phosphorus played long enough to enter free agency is final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he's still feeling the after effects of his single minded\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other\nImportant and interesting things including friends including family and [noise]\nAnd then I Will say All right\nI'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting\nMean I think it's safe feeling of loneliness honestly which and it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been\nAlmost ... focused on a goal which\nBeing focused on that goal I gave me purpose and\nI'm sure I'm going to butcher the nature of quote but it's something to the effect of a when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like I was\nDidn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I was single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get close to this\nBut don't drink now never drank in my life I never smoke we like I was single focus on doing everything every decision I may well like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I\nMy the people I was close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has a bunch of family and friends Frank that she'd been close with since they were in a second grade and like and I'm\nI don't really have that and like I was making these choices ah which I thought were choices to get me\nWhat you wanted right and I didn't realize at the time that I was\nFor going like lasting long lasting relationship [noise]\nComing up after the break what does it set you back if you pursue the athletic dream and don't make it\nThe person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they entered the game than the person who decides not to play baseball and
