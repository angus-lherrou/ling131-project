out straight up or as soon as it comes off the grill you don't want it on very long 'cause it'll burn\nThe other thing I Do with pomegranate ... a small amount to finish correct her dressing it's as you know is sweet and sour and they just add tremendous jets to that so those are two of the things I Do with it and just as an ingredient sometimes I'll put a little it is to just add a little bit of a ... sort of a secret ingredient\nBy any kind of meats do I find meat and pomegranate ... go well together any beef stew parks to lamb stew at the end you can put in a tablespoon of ... just to add a little depth to it and nobody will know what it is but it just adds flavors\nThey're adding a little bit of sweet and\nSour yeah I find is probably one of the most useful pantry staples I have if you want to make a tip of some kind or he goes well in Greek yogurt you can add a little bit to that along with some fresh herbs or other things other spices but I Would take lazy and vinegar credits and

amalgam of\nA million different kinds of things if he were to describe it is there a way to describe it to make sense or it's just too diverse\nUm the way to describe it makes sense says to accept that it's complicated and a moving target somewhat um and and that you can shape parameters around it but those parameters some time shift also on the territory that I looked at\nEnded at West Virginia and it goes down and she is the northern edge of South Carolina on the mountains of north Georgia and Alabama and of course Kentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina and if I left anybody out please don't hurt me\nAnd Alabama and of course uh Kentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina and if I left anybody out please don't hurt me it was um and so so even the geographic definition I can stretch and come together\nWe do you you drove your ... your drive and I have a van it's a Chevy astro or how many miles how long you set out to do this trip this the pilgrimage problem what were you looking for and how long were you doing [noise]\nHonestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles and then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that so it was quite it was it was very literally and journey subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipes\nAnd that was important to me because a lot\nOf what is written and has been written about um the people in the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nWell a lot of comments from one person's perspective and their family but there are their experiences in Appalachia and I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we're at this monoculture hum\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks we're all scotch Irish I'm so they're they're actually the last census\nThere are more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American there there are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point I Am my interest is that if you look at the food way\nYou can start to pick apart the complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge um some of the assumptions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about on the Appalachian\nA perfect poised to talk about food so you uh you say chili bonds carried out from the Dixie pool wrapped locally in red grief flick wax paper were my favorites [noise] okay so now now now defend that so so these were really good ... or what\nOh heck yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain a chili bond is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no\nFor what oh heck yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain\nA chili bond is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy\nChili mixture hamburger mix here that it was packed into a hotdog bond with onion and I mean it's a mustard and the texture is extremely important that it's not like a sloppy Joe it's not kind of slurping around an area it's in there or being a\nFarm and the best way to think about this is this is this is a dish that was to my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat\nYou don't want something what Chile on your hands right yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make you slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food that was this really through the ... sweet and savory banana pudding\nRonnie thank you so much a fascinating book and uh it's just like when someone takes the time of the year or so the hours to really to really do the research and find out what's

Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto general\nJim area I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is I and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was well came to base was better than ours but you went to Italy to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nYou know one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong [noise]\nFirst of all our ratios of ingredients are way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough days old they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist with that\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they in their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course produced a thicker more luxurious sauce we think we have to spend it beforehand that doesn't work I also learned that we get the order wrong\nAnd the order in which you add ingredients to either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the baseball for example into soon you're gonna over process that are over ... and that's going to give you the wrong fish consistent\nSo your goal here is to get past this pretty dry it's not a green\nSauce it's dry exactly it's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before it ever touches the pasta but it really is that loose then you've added to my olive oil and in general pessimism custard done I feel it's been added to pasta with some of the pasta water men it's considered pets are not considered a complete but that's why I say we are way too much olive oil we think supposed to be thinner earlier state so\nWhat's the order of the ingredients okay the orders very important again 'cause you don't want to order process the ingredients you start out with the garlic signed up through salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find tasted it usually distributed through test us\nThen we had our cheese if you want them finally ground add those ... and again you add those to the pine up in the garlic and you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the cheap\nNow the baseball goes it but when things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the ... and like they doing\nAnd you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the chiefs\nNow the baseball goes it but one of the things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the ... and like they do in the\nReason is they use smaller more tender base and they're able to just posted a few times and it's done our case most of the day is what we find the ... tends to be kind of bigger and a little bit heartier and we had trouble getting it to the right to assistance he without over process and turning it into a watery puree but\nThe solution actually was pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on the cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of passes and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general what\nPleases a food processor to make this probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had in general\nWell it lacks the romance of bashing it with a mortar and test all but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the war that we're getting really close and I got to say it is\nDelicious so Jim pass to ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is

this question because for years I always cooked it in a sauce pan you know which was straight sides in order to act like you said but um I had a wonderful young woman work on my last cookbook home cooking one on one and I asked her to contribute a recipe and she spent her junior year in Italy\nAnd she learned to make ... so she did a very unique Rizzo do but she cooked in in a large scale it\nAnd she said that's what they did and so now I'm sort of changed my opinion Chris\nWell our editor Jane her she was just in Italy getting results of the lessons near belong or in Milan ... yeah and they cook it in about ten minutes\nTo cook it very fast ten or Fifteen minutes they don't do the long slow saying plenty of starch comes out of the two credit creamy sauce and so the whole notion of his thirty minute low and slow it was just complete novel and stuff like how they cook it what kind of half its a wider paying like a skillet yeah yeah it's fun\nBut this whole low and slow doesn't really fascinating stirring all the time you know they started off stirring and then they just let it cook and stir occasionally so you don't have to stir constantly either\nLet me guess as this
