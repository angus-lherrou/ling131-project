rip off of Mexican cooking\nBarbecue joints are flourishing and demanding high prices mom and pop Tex Mex eateries are closing down regulate how are you good how are you know\nA good uh let's start with if possible a loose definition of when you say Tex Mex food but what what are you actually talking about\nA loose definition of Tex Mex is it's cooking\nDeveloped in Texas um originally as often a ranch food in Texas back when Texas was\nNot very urban by people often of Mexican descent um or who are who knows you know who've been in Texas in our family settled in Texas before Texas was part of the U.S [noise]\nUm that's using the local ingredients and more kind of Mexican influenced cooking styles and dishes and food that is Mexican but it's also Texan and it's really fundamentally a regional cuisine of Texas\nSo there are a few ingredients that really a defined Tex Mex ... versus let's say traditional Mexican cooking what what would be some of those ingredients\nInterestingly one of those ingredients as human in San Antonio there's actually\nA small but significant population people who came from the Canary Islands and the thought is that there's so much human in Chile and therefore started moving forward a lot of Tex Mex cooking because of the influences that specific cuisine of a Canary Islands\nThe chili ... which is a native Chile to Texas is also very important ah

literary style of writing today shares in his Ninety two years old and with no plans to retire she's currently a columnist at the Daily Beast and just launched a new special series with the sport full podcast Mimi area\nI'm very well very well\nI I don't want to rehash too many things everyone does but uh in December Seventy five you became to food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the times is that correct\n... not quite the woman who wouldn't hire may was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section ... called me up and ask me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not high on may ... name was Charlotte Curtis\nTrying to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview the woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire may her name was Charlotte Kurdish the woman who did hire me was Joan ... men of cost hired by the editor of the paper a Rosenthal\nYou still remember both of those things [laughter] well fortunately for all of us you became a critic uh first of all it's a very artificial way of eating 'cause you go with the crowd everybody orders to food you get to taste [noise] you can't just enjoy one thing or two things you have to try to eat everything obviously is critic [laughter]\nIs that something you eventually get used to and and get to like or is it always a a burden that as you would prefer not to have to do that\nI never mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested\nTo know what I Would find out and I think when you do it that way you kind of know how to separate flavor is in your mind it was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could eat the same thing tonight and have a shift experience\n[laughter] yeah well that sounds like me [laughter]\nSo we did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or in the end where people often do go with crowds uh\nWas never more than four people and usually just my husband and myself on the first try to see what's going to be worth reviewing before we filed a lot of people and expense into it\nI Know that other critics after you at the times got a lot of ... about dressing up in disguises but you were the I think the first one to really do that I Love this quote a\nAs you said even before the Internet I was recognized a few times they are very few things more Baron seen the show up in the wake of glasses and have the owners say quote good evening Mr\n[laughter] exactly I Would say so [laughter]\nYou don't know what to do should I flipped off though no should I you know play its author and I had glasses and wigs I didn't I didn't wear strange outfits though\nLet's talk about one of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop Eli et cetera you're you're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices that I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers\nWhich really like Yelp and so on\nToday I think you quote we have a lot of voices that I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers\nReally like Yelp and so on so I I actually agree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right\n[noise] well first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but even more I have never seen and I'm willing to be wrong on this I have never seen any such service require proof that the person has been a good point\nI haven't gotten him in the past not for a long time justice on a mailing list for example many years ago\nThe questionnaires from the gap saying asking me to be a responder with all the things the frail and\nAnd I thought how do they know if I'd been there I'd even ask Tim's a gap that and he said we have a way to which I say baloney [noise] because you could just a ... if it's a friend who owns the restaurant or a relative\nOr if you just want to sound often use you repeat that kind of rating from your local critic just to have a voice in there so I don't really care what those people say\nYeah that that's true I mean the social media you see all sorts of strange comments and their access to the ground all over so let's talk about casual dining I think you and I come out of the same place\nYou walk into a restaurant and the first Fifteen or thirty seconds what are some of the things that the you'll notice I won't either good or bad\nI noticed the number of help on the floor I might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and are moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty\nI might notice the overall age of the people I might notice if there are serving stations around the room I'll tell you a funny story about that there is a super\nGreek diner in Chicago known as little Mitchell's and it's right near the American to exchange and the stock exchange and it opens four or five in the morning because the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just larger than life at the breakfast and I went one morning alone because I was writing about\nSo on and the food is just larger than life\nAt the breakfast and I want one morning alone because I was writing about Chicago restaurant I Want around eight thirty and I had to stand on line a little and does he does the owner or his managing gives out little boxes of um a\nCandy what do they call it any way to to women\nStanding on the line and finally after about Fifteen minutes I became the head of the line and the manager came over to me and said where is your place\nAnd I said what place and he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\nThough I really didn't for [laughter] it's like a Campbell or in a casino like you look around the milk\nThat is what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line and you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast Scott\n... right now I'm heading into the kitchen a milk street to chat with when Clark about this week's recipe Tuscan beef and peppers to\nLynn how are you I'm sure there's a recipe I you know the recipe it's a Tuscan beef and peppers to its beef lots of beef obviously\nPepper ground pepper and why county whatever just throwing the pot cooking slow come back a few hours later it's done\nI made this recipe before but the problem with a recipe I think is that when you just put wind it would be in a pot it takes a lot of the flavor out of the meat the meat is hardly flavor was and the wind isn't rich and ... it's kind of just the city can kinda nasty actually [laughter]\nSo I I don't know how they're used to doing Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen what do we do\nHave critically really took the wind out of the equation and in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation\nAnd so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of these really heavily seasoned with salt and pepper and we put that in a pot with some aeronautics\nYeah really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of beef really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pepper and we put that in a pot with some aromatic and no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to brace is late comes from the meat itself\nThere's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavor so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice and\nYou're not supposed to be before you put it in just you cook the ... a little bit then put the meeting but you're not doing anything else would lead before because there\nWere not that we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of ... to me without actually having to do the work which you know we live around here\nSo instead of cooking at the whole time covered we take the cover off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning underneath there that you would have gotten if you've been taught to hate it at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the ones who are the ones not in the ones waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the recipe at the end I Hope\nIt does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning it really diluted not only the flavor of the sauce economy the meat tastes a little weird as well\nSo we waited until the very end to add that so we take the meat out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strained ... chooses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich sauce\nSo this recipe that can be from peppers to almost no prep work\nA little use tomato paste the beat in three hours of the up and take it out reduced some more into that any are done\nIt's a matter of fact and it tastes great taste so good when thank you You're welcome\nAnd get this recipe for these and ... do have one seven seven milk street dot com\n\nOn ...

street who's on the line Hi Tony Hi Bethany where you calling from Houston, Texas nice\nHow can we help you today\nFirst I'd like to say I'm a huge fan and I really appreciate all of that you and Chris exposes too and provide thank you I like to cook and I really um I read the new and I want to try you know these new global type recipes\nMy question for you is what some pantry staples that would bring in a more global fair that I could use regularly in my cooking\nOh boy yeah we're we're going to have to pick and choose you asked us to look at it and that's hard it's like well you want to start with spice blends first and then move on those are I mean I think the spices the most people don't have\nThe sitar which is based on while time but it's got lots of other stuff in it I think is the most versatile useful spice blend in the world outside Saturday seeds and for Mac\nYeah ensue Mac would be another thing it's a Barry used to be used almost in place of lemon it's our but it's also lemony great on tomatoes you can use it on almost anything\n... seed not ground coriander is something most people don't have around I think is also really useful I'm going to put in a bed for a pet ...\n... that's really great also because for vegetarians you know when you can add bacon or smoked salmon or some sort of pork\nSmokes Patrick type Rica that drilling rate also because for vegetarians you know when you can add bacon or smoked salmon or some sort of pork products you can add smoked ... give it a little bit of snow the now you can\nBuy India they have these little kittens which have smaller tens in them for spices ... plans herbs and you can buy one of those ... and you can\nKeep in that ten sort of the old purpose spices the spice sponsor for example at breakfast I'll take the ten out and put some ... some pepper or something on it and you can dress up eggs you can dress up anything\nNext is pantry items I think teeny is literally a must yeah and me so\nShe any by the way goes gray with chocolate her Aretha yes absolutely mix it with Greek yogurt for ... for example\nOr a sandwich spread me so it was a great soup base white me so for chicken or the night so I have a fish when you're ...\nAnd then my last suggestion would be pomegranate molasses which you can find almost everywhere it's our and it's sweet you can use it and I use it in a salad dressings just a little bit any kind of dressing or you can ... over meet after it's cooked\nOr ice cream or ice cream anywhere you use a good quality ... can you see a pomegranate molasses I also want to throw in a vote for ... because they provide a smoking is Anna wonderful heat\nTo other simple things if you buy whole human seed if you get a pepper Grider putting coarse salt and then putting human seat\nSo instead of salt and pepper your ... in human yeah and that is just for a general purpose way to improve your cooking you really can't beat that and then the last thing is have really big crystal like sea salt or ... or ... and salt just to finish food or would that crunch\nYou get a lot of mileage off that that's a good start yeah okay that is a great start one life thing if you want to be a little exotic by or if a pepper you are FA you have to bite on line it's a soft damp pepper in sort of flakes\nAnd its chocolate he and rich is not too hot you know it goes on a lot of dishes and it's just a few little tricks like that can make her cooking so much better so anyway that's our list\nOkay finally done what I was looking out for me to look at it like\nThis is mostly radio I'm

you\nMight get range recently went out in nature type thing I got it bad for how much it would cost ... kitchen which can be about a hundred and Seventy five dollars [noise]\nSo I'd like to know your hand I never cut down a gas strange but I Know it generally referred by professional but knowing that extra cost I Would encourage had the luxury is it worth it\nWell when we built up the street kitchens a couple of years ago for a variety of reasons we couldn't use all gas cook tops we had to use induction for many of them\nAnd I was not a fan of that but we do to install induction it turns out induction works very well it heats up fast uh it's not any slower than gas I prefer dial you know and I like to see the gas\nBut once you get used to the controls than it does a terrific job so also safer because you're not going to buy yourself so I wouldn't ...\nChristmas you know an induction is yeah the magnetic ... and the point is that it heats up the pan through magnetism through the metal\nIn the pan so that only the pan hates not really the burner\nAnd it really hates it efficiently and you can get it high and get it low very quickly and here's the thing about induction you'll save money in the long run because it's the most energy efficient of all forms of heat and cooking 'cause the heat only goes into the pan", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city":
