Florida huh your father grew up in the south your mother was from Guam well tell us about one time for it or what what was the community like well\nI guess it was an interesting place I I Would say it was lower class living it was not the best living situation but I feel like it gave me a lot of contrast to ask for a lot of great things\nWell you you write that there was Jamaican Cuban Haitian food and culture so the food must have been really great\nYeah definitely there was a lot a lot of wonderful I mean like Jamaican beef patties you know cabbage and ... and rice\nAnd then on my father's side you know like things that my grandmother main just really really hearty um delicious southern food you know a Mac and cheese and she made the delicious spaghetti that\nThe I think if you catch up and which sounds strange now but it gave it its nice sweet ass and so it's definitely a a wide range of of flavors that I grew up\nAnd you and you also write that you when you were fourteen you are overweight and are you became a vegan or as a result to you so you really changed your entire dog yeah when you were a\nTeenager him right I did um I think a lot of it with me trying to find myself a lot of it with me trying to find my identity within all of that\nSo by becoming vegan that set you apart from your family your brothers and sisters who were so leading the traditional diet\nBut hey it was it was a stark contrast you know like our dinner or very meat centered\nBrothers and sisters who were so leading the traditional dark\nRight it was it was a stark contrast you know like um dinners were very meat centered and you know starch heavy because a lot of it too you know we're trying to feed a large family on a on a small budget so\nThis whole concept of cooking from scratch was born because I had to be creative I had to think of a new way to create this food that I Love and I want it to taste but that fit by diet and another\nDo you like the texture or do you find it more tender or kiss and the\nMore tender I tend to like meet that is not as tender you know I'd rather have flavorful than thunder and my wife tends to like meet that is more tender I think also since its grilled you notice the difference in texture you know of the slate trying on the outside it cetera if the inside is more under\nI Would guess that it may be the age of the animal\nBecause if it's a younger animal it's probably going to be more tender and if it's an older animal shelter that is not going to work does need to cook that low and slow like going to do\nSo you need the equivalent of a ... very expensive I think we have to be a line cuts for a quick cooking ... you can't use like and you can you shoulder right okay well you like it just would be chillier yes he'll be chewing and he doesn't\nWant which is what I've been doing you know just because it's an easier cut to find and less expensive I mean I have another side which is salt ah yeah I mean I've always put some salt but right before you could just before I cook a\nPlant you try something that I had a dime tossing it with all those other things and that or you know padded try or just ...\nRally it gets a nice here I bet you the salt would make a difference\nOkay yeah well I I Would ask them just ask them about the ... what kind of isn't the way they get their land with him\nIn the search for this I did buy like a leg that uh hello butcher sawed off a lamb for me but uh but that didn't really help a and that was a young land but I was young enough that it was um you know hard to work around the leg

I'm\nWelcome to milk street who's calling this is Nick travel Hi Nick how can we help you well\nI've spent years failing to recreate the dishes but I the India you're not only due to lack of the authentic ugly idiots in\nGlee American issue is the age you can go and sit around and\nThere are smaller slightly sweeter and of course anger that North American the ins but they don't just color like Retta onions director long cooking\nAnd they're far less sweet than the daily as a ... show with a hundred and four and ... like a ... or even something that's in the background like a butter chicken\nYou end up with a great career you if you attempt to you like or accordingly we create if you do with while the ... or something like that or just something that's true sure every usually is just too many onions your standard larger American yellow one\nLet me ask a question ... yellow onions are sharp when they're raw but in our testing it milk street we find they actually turn sweet [noise] do you find is just the amount of on you or do you find the yellow onions are still two overpowering when cooked a\n... you know what it's a bit of both but you just end up with a completely different and fall in love onions solid\nI Know it's there is going to say so\nHe knows what I'm saying well how about ...\n... you know they are sweeter than a yellow on yeah but not playing Lee sweet\nI you know we tried to Charlotte it's just not the same the flavor is a very different\nI mean if you're a big complaint is volume I Would think just the yellow onion and to see is less is the simplest\nThing I think getting the spices right and using whole spices and posting them and doing all the things you should do will make much difference in weather using\nSaying I think getting the spices right and using whole spices toasting them and doing all the things you should do will make much difference in weather using yellow or to paint in right I mean that's really the crux of it hopefully next to agree with that assessment\nI Would agree with that and you know the sort of side bar here is also the total lack of a veil ability of genuine Kashkari chili which ends up being introduced to many of those careers were you given that color and everyone tries to approximate or a kind of the athletes are black that's what you\nKnow yeah I like to make sense you know one serious

social activism including the edible schoolyard project\nIn her memoir coming to my senses waters explains what shaped your view that food can be an instrument of social change\n[noise] let's go back to the beginning so you're young you grow up in New Jersey and you say I get dressed it was so cold in the house in the winter I get dressed down in the basement by the furnace where my father was shoveling coal\nThat is almost Dickens quality [laughter] you know so you actually had a coal furnace and you'd get dressed right next to the cold for us on a cold winter morning [noise]\nI did because he had ... to ... to ... coming radiators [laughter] that's bad happened every morning in my kitchen knife we're sleeping lay offs tennis addict part\nTime\nIf it's cold [laughter] um the my favorite story though which I Will repeat on radio since he wrote about it\nWith a Montessori school and you had a you had a child who who bit lot who was a biter and you know I could because when you think with your sister when you bought her a you used to buy back and you actually bit him back\nAnd I thought well [laughter] I don't know why I guess it's not funny but the idea of Alice Waters and a Montessori school biting back a child who's a biter just I don't know it just struck me somehow so ... ... exactly what happened\nBiting back a child who's a biter just I don't know it just struck me somehow so ... ... exactly what happens\nIt happens very impulse I must I used to being around really young children and I\nCertainly hadn't been around any that were misbehaving and I didn't know what to do and I was about twenty six years old and I\nI had learned demand ... message tonight tried to to trust him and you know the projects\nAnd he chose\nWouldn't stop and I just when he heard another child I just grabbed his arm I [noise] I didn't find them hard [laughter] but I was ashamed that I did that and um [noise]\nI thought that I was I was being let go from the school because of that incident\nWith so many other food celebrities that going on to other restaurants in other careers that got me thinking about the good life perhaps it simple enough\nFind out what you like to do and just keep doing it you might say it's really the mileage that matters as long as you keep driving at a straight line\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen to bilk street to chat with editorial

I'm doing great it's pasta bean day here in milk strayed it is about ... or as fluffy ... [laughter] but still exist recipes in hundreds of times I've done it many times you've done it but you went to Italy to see if there was something new or something that we don't know here\nYou know it is such a simple dish and\nI guess that's what attracted me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have an amazing amount of flavor and an hour max that they bring to the table and it didn't hurt that I learned it at this ...\nTo me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have an amazing amount of flavor and ... that they bring to the table\nAnd it didn't hurt that I learned it at this crazy winery that used to be owned by the mafia apparently the government took away from the mafia and gave it to a retired stolen art inspectors around in the meantime of course of course because it's just like [noise]\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was willing to teach me basic rustic Sicilian huffing and this was one of the ... she taught\nThe minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the richer Rome is a federal and Rosemary and garlic and it turns out that what she had done is first and ... into a pot that had been soaked overnight\nFor in some wild federal that she'd grabbed from the driveway of the winery\nA ton of Rosemary and garlic cooked them away and when the deans were done to Austin some pasta started altogether and it was outrageously good for such a simple collection of ingredients to have such an amazing flavor profile they were layers of richness and creamy nest and yet there was no dairy in it\nSo why is this different than the eighty nine versions all been through\nYour I think the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the ... the beans are kind of like a starchy counter punch to the rich\nFederal the rich Rosemary and the garlic I mean those are really the dominant flavors that you're getting and they're married and this kind of like starchy liquid from the beans and from the pasta itself\nAnd so the result is really rich and creamy an aromatic and again for such a simple\nIngredients it just has an amazing impact in place so I assume when we got back here did you make any alterations so that we did we made a couple of first of all we simplified it for weeknight ease we use can beings and we were very happy with the results because in part the canned beans have that structure water you need to get the creamy sauce that we were looking for\nThe other thing we did was we found it was a little heavy and we wanted to lighten it up with that and I'd eaten the dish a second time ... and\nThat turned the woman making it added some tomatoes which we live so we borrow that to kind of bring a little bit of a city to it and finally we felt that a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest also help tie everything together is right there and also really played well with the Russian are\nSupposed to call ... and like I say you know a basic recipe but now authentic

rid of all and falling off and I was wondering if you had any\nDonna I'm having a problem with a lot of them crystallizing\nAfter I've played that doughnuts and sort of getting rid of all and falling off and I was wondering if you had any tips on how to run back what is in your in glaze\nWell it usually starts with a Sarah base either like fruit puree with sugar or maple syrup or honey\nAnd then I'll with skin confectionery sugar and I've recently started out in a sad such as butter or white chocolate or shortening and also a corn syrup product and that tends to help with the uh the conciliation but\nIt's still sort out on some of them and I think it may have to do with reading them or like dry out in the fridge I'm just not sure\nI was gonna say corn so that was my answers yeah ... I've got nothing left to say but what percentage of sugar is the corn syrup\nUsually a five to ten percent of the powdered sugar staying with a shortening are fat I'm shooting for around five to ... and that seems to help but\nAfter heating and cooling maybe that's causing the criminalization or\nKnow the other things I can think of is like the doughnuts being too hot or the ... when it goes on to the donut\nWhat do you do they take that down at that glaze 'em right away or you let them cool a little usually\nLet them cool like up to an hour or so before I get to them and then the glaze I'm trying to get as close to just warm as possible\nIn the industry when you research before you open the shop did they say to glazed doughnut sit there at a certain temperature\nPool is what I've been reading and seeing from other industry folks I must say British chef by\nTrade so there's this sort of new to me the whole confection side of things\nI Would think that if they cooled then you might have a more stable adherence between the clays in the doughnut because if it's cooling there's steam coming off I don't know yeah I I Would try perfectly cool doughnuts and see if\nThat helps you know let me just turned ... um you know and I glazed doughnut just at home you know with a simple plays in powdered sugar melts in LA [noise]\nUsually I've been advised political very slightly and to put the ... air warm you know maybe try Mary called because you've got a heated clays the glaze I Do is not heated more try him right when they you know like four minutes five minutes out of the oven\nHave you found that it depends on the humidity of the day or the temperature outside or is it\nAbsolutely so can I come\nMinutes out of the oven\nHave you found that it depends on the humidity of the day or the\nTemperature outside or is it absolutely\nSo can I come to your shop and get a discount on the one with the ... [laughter] I mean maybe they guy well no maybe Sticky Fingers scout moment Dickey finger maybe that's a I don't turn it into marketing plus yeah\nThat's not a bad idea [laughter]\nNo I I Would try different temperatures and I would play with a percentage of corn syrup just double it and see if that makes a difference I haven't done anything that hire you know just doubled and see if that solves the problem because that would be an easy fix absolutely\nI Want to do that yeah Jay you did a good job there man hungry and good luck with accents\nI Love the show and it's it's great to talk to you guys I think they care\nAbout I welcome to milk street who's on the line\nI this is this level it how can we help you\n[noise] so I guess about a year ago I\nRead the uh Giuliani who wrote that seminal book on Indian cooking her description of how to capitalize on ya and ... and it's different than the way I learned how to care more than ... which is to sweat the onion almost as soon as they get their hands with soap\nFinally doesn't mention that putting salt until like very ends and ever since then I've tried it both ways and I have basically not been able to the cameras on the incense\nYou mean that whole thing the round you say your onions don't care much any more\nI got ...
