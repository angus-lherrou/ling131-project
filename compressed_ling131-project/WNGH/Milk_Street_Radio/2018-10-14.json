crusader Ruth Desmond use the peanut butter controversy to change our food regulation of a lot of what the FDA does now and what it was doing back in the time of the peanut butter war I\nWas trying to figure out how many peanuts should there be an peanut butter and should it be a hundred percent peanuts or if not then where should the line be drawn and and that quickly becomes an existential question\nMany peanuts should there be an peanut butter and should it be a hundred percent peanuts or if not then where should the line be drawn him and that quickly becomes an ex a central question even if you think it's a really simple question beginning\nBefore we dive into peanut butter checking with reporters really was it at the bus station in Tel Aviv to get great Filipino food\nHow are you\nI'm good how are you good um well it started in Tel Aviv on a Saturday afternoon Sabbath there is a very large bus station two and a half million square feet there we will start the story there\nOkay so I'm Saturdays and Tel Aviv are pretty slow days most people including foreign workers have a day off to a day of rest public transportation shuts down a lot of the shops are closed people go to the beach and the bus station it's pretty much shut down\nExcept for the fourth floor which transforms into sort of a little manila\nThere is a food market and it comes alive with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Filipino workers I stepped in line and started talking to some of the women there\nOn Saturday on many PBS our timing here you know the\nSome day I think some ...\nThey are setting here [noise]\nSo women Filipino caregivers who have their day off basically they got off work they go home and they'll either start cooking friday night or early Saturday morning and they show up at the bus station around noon\nThey'll bring these like huge plastic Tupperware it's filled with warm noodles and stir Fry's vegetable dishes little plastic containers full of\nDesserts um and they set up these tables in the hallway of the bus station there's also produce markets so they sell produce that normally you don't get in Israel so 'cause solve our route lemon grass\nDifferent bitter chords that you don't normally see an Israeli grocery store um we'll all be like stocked up in the bus station and they can not only to eat and to have this and all your foods\nBut they also come to hang out with friends and see relatives and people who they knew from the Philippines to see how their work is going into chat about work and life in Israel and life away from their families and the Philippines\nAnd he's in the Philippines\nOver the next Fifteen or twenty minutes all set up properly but that will help the other thing you have to check his course Robin temperature but you know you waited till I was fully set which means it'll be overcooked by the time it comes out Sarah I'm no I agree I agree I think Chris you're probably right quick question how many eggs and how much buttermilk\nHow much sugar three large eggs in one couple that are not I didn't decrease the sugar a little bit I took the quarter and a little bit less than a cop flavor which great but I also wonder how much\nThis is how strict as what happens on a call in show I just everything's fine until about five minutes they call and tell me what happened well I cooked it over my barbecue and ... are actually around this fit enough\nWell you're right sugar is high gross carpet attracts moisture it has a huge effect on something like a custard pie\nBecause the chemistry so\nGo back and use the racial amounts and take it out when it goes to the center if that works then you know you solve that problem now the question is how much should be you can take out it especially with the cranberries I Would think that could be a problem you might have to add an extra egg that's very delicate chemistry\nAll right well I certainly try that says thank you so much for your ... yeah well see what happens now ... thank you\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher ... if you have a cooking failure a complaint or if you just want to try to stump us give us a call that number is eight

Logan, Ohio Hi Ryan what is your question today\nWell my question is a month and next week or some of our own field corn last year wow and so we were trying to\nAnd next to ... and a week or some of our own field corn last year wow yeah it was a fun so we were trying to make at home and we did not have I guess it's\nGoing Lyme so we're trying to use what ashes and we weren't really able to find a lot of good information so I was wondering if\nYou guys at and answers\nI go to Amazon and get the rights to tough to get it to your door tomorrow that's what I Would do I've heard about what actually being used the question is what kind of one and I mean what do they do with it now yeah I Would go get the right stuff\nThey by the way I Do have a question I assume it's a very specific type of corn you're growing for this right [laughter] ... uh like the kinds of field corn I mean it used to say\nRight that was another thing that came up we grew and Italian variety I Can't remember the name of it off the top of my head but I did notice the colonel's look a little bit more like popcorn but it's marketed as a Flint core and like something you know what you like or\nPoland or we've made cornbread with it and things like that so that was another thought that I wondered if that would make it more difficult to make money so it the the colonel's we're a little bit smaller point you heard about ...\nYou know you can buy most of [laughter] I mean you're you know let me just to understand that you're doing this because it's an idea of perfectly agree with you this is just a cool thing to want to try to do right right\nI think it was an episode of fear is that they're talking about corn tortillas and how the flavor was better if you're at home fresh compared to like using Moscow hurry and I like the stuff at the store that's dried\nNo I don't think we were saying grow your own field corn boiling by mixture [laughter] pouring off get rid of the ... for four hours I think we just had that if you made your own mixture at home instead of buying the pre made\nHere's a thought there's some wonderful our teeth no companies that make you read in ... finance and mills isn't it ... I wouldn't be surprised if you called the ban some males and asked them what is the proportion that they wouldn't tell you\nAnd then a lot of good call one of the companies in just order some awesome\nI think this is very do want to do one that would be my best gesture and even though both of us for hippies back in the day we weren't trying to get around that\nI think this is Mary and you don't want to do one that would be my best suggestion even though both of us for hippies\nBack in the day we weren't trying to get our own Brian thank you so much yeah great question how do you hope you find the [laughter]\n[noise]\nAnd you're listening to mistreat radio host Hugh Grant\nComing up next my conversation\nI'll be chatting with her about the secret history of peanut butter\nSupport

Joseph\nOn the medical minute is written and produced by the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University in collaboration with GPS gossip\nThat this is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball at the center of modern federal food regulations as one of America's favorite foods peanut butter and the Nineteen fifties many companies were doctoring their recipes with untested additives\nRuth does have been to Washington area homemaker decided to fight back and change the way food is regulated here in America reporter Krissy Clark produced a three part series on the peanut butter wars for marketplace and she's here today to tell us the story of the peanut butter grandma\nOf course the area I'm great thank you so this all starts the late fifties people are manufacturing peanut butter that's not all ...\nOften in significant amount not peanuts or at one point and then\nManufacturing peanut butter that's not all ...\nYeah often in significant amount not peanuts uh at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out these rumors started popping up that ah\nThere or in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is that the ... percenters is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of ingredients were perfectly healthy wonderful things\nDoes it really matter [laughter] well\nI think that is a big question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was a\nChris go there was actually in the ... the factory formula [laughter] at the just plant it was up to twenty percent Chris coat and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks\nDescribed it as if it wasn't a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream [laughter]\nJobs are really doesn't hydrogenated fish boil doesn't sound like a great concept so the consumer reaction was fairly substantial dues tell us about it and how that happened and why did that happen\nAnd and how upset were people yeah well it all kind of comes\nDown to this one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of homemakers here's ... daughter Janet swab or\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and a ... children that are eating these peanut butter sandwiches mostly just peanut flavored cream\nDesmond was a homemaker herself\nA very spirited very determined woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out what had happened and wanted to be feeding him healthy food\nThis was a time in American history where food was really transforming that was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our food\nIndustry is coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant a and so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice that mention that they were proposing a standardized definition for peanut butter\nAnd ah when she discovered that ... what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nA lot of this hydrogenated vegetable oil into\nThe jars of peanut butter that she was buying she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers and a flood of consumer comments started coming in to the FDA hundreds literally hundreds of letters here is Janet again [noise]\nUntil their golden brown so that really adds a lot of sweetness to the dish\nAnd we use a combination of fresh\nWhole spices and ground spaces here so fresh cilantro stands and ginger whole cumin coriander and yellow mustard seeds and then ... and that just gets cooked together for about thirty seconds till you can kind of smell those spaces [noise]\nThe only love about this is that the Syrian American vegetables legumes are kind of bland they weren't like the centerpiece all you have to do is look to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this is as good as eating steak commit has a tremendous amount of flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of tomato at the end I\nAdd those yellow split keys to the dish those are really thick and creamy you serve it over rice with a cucumber pickles and yogurt you can um as they do and visions restaurant they add a fried egg on the top to make it kind of a more complete meal but really this is so

ready to do this welcome to melt street who's calling\nHi my name is Rachel Hi Rachel how can we help you today well\nThink you know rather is on various websites and I ran across a on a website I like a lot ... than sort of healthy California style food that caught our cat cow powder and then when I looked at it than if\nAnd let's say like a lot ... than a third of how the California style food that caught our cat cow powder and then when I looked at it than is like cocoa powder but not roasted and I couldn't quite figure out\nWhat the differences in terms of the taste and I say I mean I read up and I it's I guess it all like they have assets cat cow ahead than than if they get killed at the same path as something\nThat's right yeah Cal powders just cold pressed cocoa beans that are not roasted ... as opposed to Coco which is roasted beans that are turning to pattern of course the fattest removed as well\nI looked it up actually once someone said you have to use more don't you process cocoa than Cal powder ... powder maybe stronger tasting but I don't I've never tested it I Would try one to one but I Would think the press is going to be stronger flavor\nYeah I Would imagine that a good thing definitely yeah and I think I experiment with it just profile and please get back to us we liked the follow up\nOkay well I have a federal cap hotter and my Patrick make something\nThat we like that but uh so yeah I well I I I get I\nWelcome to the street who do we have on the line on the ground in Heineken Hi Brendan how can we help you today\nI got some green coffee beans from a friend of mine and I just don't have to do it I Try to roast 'cause that's where you are needed to do with it really know what to do it either\nSearch I swore when we're in a pair for awhile and they kind of started letting off these real paper ... scary it was worth it yeah and it's going to go from green point because every color to bird yeah\nI Would do Chris you've done is about ten years ago I went through this whole process because I Love coffee and uh I bought a number of different roasters sort of a a popcorn popper where the their air rated and they they go up in the air and swirl around\nI did the rotating drum roaster the more expensive one and here the problems first of all a lot of smoke\nSo you have to do it underneath the hood if some guy that wasn't weren't moving to New York city apartment secondly I found that every batch of beans had a different roasting time and temperature and it's very complicated to get a roast right because otherwise some of the burn and some of them are green and he says problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better then\nRoast right because otherwise some of the burn and some of them are green it's this problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than actually was worse than beans I could just lie at the local Lauer may place for us so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right\nTo get the roasting the flavor right you know the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time [noise] I never had much luck these things are expensive and there's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go down gave I finally well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not grounds beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way\nTo go well unless bring any kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nOn that kinda stuff I've only got a couple of pounds of these green beans I don't think it's worth it go great older maybe do it just sort of like in a pan or something\nLike ... three or four hundred dollars and go to get hot bath and we found is second hand you know a popcorn popper you know to thrift store it might be worth\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place there's like ten different kinds of beans and you can get really good teams and make great coffee and the other thing I find is I like lighter roast like medium roast getting the the roast just write with these things is also a little tricky tricky so anyway there you go\nTo think so much okay Brandon thanks for calling ice recalling already picked her\nThis is mostly radio I'm your host Christopher ... please give us a ring the number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eighty five five four to six nine eight for three or send us an email at questions of milk street radio\nDot com welcome to the street who's calling Hi this is Han Casey how can we help you today okay\nSo um you know I loved it in the kitchen love to cook my one weakness I think is with\nThe wind gotten that have liquor there it happened to deal with a try and I think the decoration presentation all of that I Try a lot of ... if you get home from my own truck and I\nIt but they never seem to work for the ice skating I Try that out or sugar with milk and paying it always comes out ... guilty and\nThey never seem to work for the ice skating I Try that out or sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out right ... ... and then I tried that cream cheese one in the mix or oh so it doesn't work\nWhat happens to the cream cheese when\nIt never really become credible like I always even though I keep it room temperature I always feel like it clumps and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there so how can I make really good things and I think at home\nI agree with you that the powdered sugar I ... yeah I really don't you can add like orange juice to understand but I I don't orange that idea they never turn out now I don't like him a chocolate crossing always worst nicely because of the chocolate cools it sets up\nI like an Italian ... or Swiss spring which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup like at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much\nAnd then you drizzle it on the egg white says for beating them and the mixer for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice fluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so there's not that hard to do but you have another\nNo I was just going to say the Boyles frosting which is sort of similar involves egg whites print out what just sugar water egg whites ... but the thing about the Italian see you added sugar served the egg whites there's also the Swiss where you heat up the sugar in egg whites in America to about one sixth day\nThose are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for crossing I assume", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth",
