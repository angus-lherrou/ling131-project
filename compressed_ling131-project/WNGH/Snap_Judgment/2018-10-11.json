torrent of water and was like almost getting swept away barely able to hold on to the law\nAnd I got about three quarters aware trial and ah I ended up setting off his older I'm finding into the main current and ours right on the top of a waterfall and\nThought to myself like a nice for idiot because now you're going to hurt relatively drown in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely stuck but also get the get the log across the river and then getting safely onto the other riverbank\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across logging get across the river\nAnd a girl came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand employment when the rock and he was terrified and it was rocking log\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand\nI was trying really really hard to establish that connection as to why I wanted and even if he didn't need a hand I wanted to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me his rifle\nAnd I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I'm very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling ... patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and they kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like Penn and among the shoulder and they're like ... will die like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed\nBolger like they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nOr the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they pray and they might not our business\nBut there's this guy in their country that's been charged with a really bad guy the elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nThere was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplain to John that we were all the way to go to this other place and then his boss was getting get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\n[noise] um I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nSort of split into two groups of thought I remember about than myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as evil as you might think even though we have seen them murder somebody I very much so\nI'm as victims of circumstances somewhere that specially with a guy that Jason and I were with every day she was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there\nJason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there in the same and you know doing the same thing he was doing but\nJason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but you would strategize about how we would pick up Iraq's bashed in their schools are\nStab their next with sticks damage out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and just by his throat just teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker robbed and um yeah I was in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky train one of the characters bare split on now is only two countries with guns to for climbers they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did that for three days starving\nAnd I came up it just really good game to play to pass the time\nUm where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nWe start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and\nWhere you're going to go to buy the supplies\nAnd then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asked what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out I had been five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth or super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nDid have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive I'm Still seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape\nThe communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive of do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal right\nAnd he said here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain among with only one of his men as guard in in that one guard was to\nHe kind of weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together it's summer there was said\nAnd and obviously myth that he has the story that I spent a week selling to us\nJust bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and back then to not\nServed pleading with him not to go\nGet dangerous out there there's soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was had Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out he he has this look like he's I Know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up still tracking down towards the Base Camp\nWill Jason and his crew lets to up the mountain\nNow it was four to one\nTime I felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nBall and excitement because it was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and anger named the knife and here are move like all of that and you leave one dumb kid with a gun was for other kids I completely changes everything oh\nThis was a very early climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since there was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\nUm\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find [noise] and I'm trying to always\nKind of direction to away that looks like the easiest way but also puts them in the most danger if he falls off or gets\nOff when you could tell they were\nIn a way that looks like the easiest way to also puts them in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nWhen you could tell they were there like this is a moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then\nI stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything in the region don't and believe\nMorally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and when racing up the class or just\nScrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all\nI I think the surgeries have at times exacerbated\nSome of those negative traits that I mentioned the can tanker is\nPart [laughter]\nBone here's what I'm saying to him [noise] he support me off in a second operation have made me stiff\nCarrying this man [noise] um [noise] not manifest in my personality [noise] um I always\nKnew that he had medical issues and then obviously it has to brand surgeries and I was really traumatic for me I think I was fourteen at the time ... something like that and\nThis is huge brother spent and while stewardess stiff or brittle spent you know like everyone in his family to me all hard and free spirit [noise] he loves being outdoors listened to the way he talked about mountain biking\nI liked it I can just zone out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like like I had cranes revolving like one two one two or something like that you kinda\nAnd just focus home peddling dropped my head down to really like ... crunch revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you're trying to\nYou know you had a source of joy and you're just like foreign down it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy do\nYou do one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old\nAnd through started getting headache to\nVery terrible headache and he was diagnosed with it now formation in his brain [noise]\nYou know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain now from Asians\nBecause he was crazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another but spenders brings to Jewish and didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would result [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when the ... became very adamant with one request [noise]\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery [laughter] no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm\nWithout his input I felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's about ... about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of ah just\nStarted coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nA different person center was scared his personality which which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise]\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nThe change is enormous\nLike there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family\nAnd it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nHe's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nGo [noise] so\nI think for Spencer seeing how I turned out [noise]
