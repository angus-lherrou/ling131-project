actually terrified though I just committed I charged out there and I just grabbed\nThe log and [noise]\nPlowed into this raging torrent of water and just like almost getting swept away barely able to hold on to the law\nAnd I got about three quarters of the crowd and ah I ended up setting off his older I'm planning into the main current and ours right out of the top of a waterfall and\nTo myself like a nice for idiot because now you're going to hurt relatively drown in front of your friends\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely stuck but also get the get the log across the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank\nAnd not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across as logging get across the river\nAnd bill came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand employment with Iraq and he was terrified and it was rock and logging\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand\nI was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get out\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was like well even better [noise]\nI'm Sorry I took his rifle and I turned around and I'm very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie County patting me on the back and asking me if\nThe soldier they looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like Penn and I'm On the shoulder and they're like little dog\nI'm sure\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like having among the sub shoulder and they're like sold like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they ... they might not our business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge for a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nThere was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of my from splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained a John that we were all the way to go to this other place and then his boss was getting get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\n[noise] um I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my prayers were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember about myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just trying to wait it out Jason and John wanted to\nTake matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our chapters as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murders somebody I very much\nSo I'm as victims of circumstances somewhere\nIs evil as you might think even though we have seen them murders somebody\nI very much a them as victims of circumstance in some ways I specially\nThe guy that Jason and I were with every day she was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same and you know doing the same thing he was doing but\nJason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStab their next with sticks damage out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and ... and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and a jump on this guy and just by just throw his teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than steak or robbed and um yeah I was in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky train one of their captors bear split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers they won and locked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did that for three days starving\nAnd I came up it just really good game to play to pass the time [noise]\nUm where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nHe started imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broke and ask for time it was and we take guesses and\nIt turns out than five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably when Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on our chief or super sore from chattering all the time the days just felt unbelievably long\nDid have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived\nI Am but they just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nI'm Still seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal right\nAnd he said here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys Base Camp and now I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to\nShe kind of weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet is\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe\nAnd and obviously myth that he had bombed the story that I spent a week selling to learn\nAbout it was a Clinton thinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad Denali\nServed pleading with him not to go\nIs dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was had Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to not go he he has this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up till tracking down towards the Base Camp\nJason and his crew lets see up the mountain\nNow it was for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nBall of excitement because it was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and the anger named the knife in either of like all of that and you leave one dumb kid with a gun was for other kids I completely changes everything oh\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since there was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\nUm\nCommunicated to each other that the game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the\nAnd I'm always trying to find an unjust\nThere's going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find [noise] and I'm\nTrying to always kinda directs to away that looks like the easiest way to also puts them in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nWhen you can tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nI stopped on a small ledge ... bath and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it\nAnd she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything that we still didn't believe\nMorally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chances of survival\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and we're raising up the class just\nScrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm\nI think the surgeries have at times exacerbated\nSome of those negative traits that I mentioned the content Chris\nPart [laughter]\nBoom boom here's what I'm saying
