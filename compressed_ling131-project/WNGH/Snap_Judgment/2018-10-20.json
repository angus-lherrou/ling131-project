windows in this place and it's so gloomy it had thirty windows [noise]\nUm but I was desperate and it really was a nice place that had all hardwood floors that had a fireplace and it was a great neighborhood\nAnd I said I'll take it for different within a pint of going through tough divorce and needed a place\nTo land hit two cats Mike who's nine at the time and cat who is seven\nWe were living in the top floor there was a two family home and uh we had the second floor apartment above the apartment was a full size addict which had its own dorm hers and it was really used for

life magazines and I remember very clearly that Mike\nIs becoming more and more uncomfortable with the fact that he was pulling them all out of order and Mike was feeling like don't touch that this isn't yours don't touch it [noise]\n\nIt wasn't just old magazines and records up there in the attic looking around I remember\nDistinctly seeing a rope tied to one of the rafters and cut at the
