P. B. Y. U. [noise]\nListening to radio lab\nRadio around you and why [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that what don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping we must but we ... it is on the radio yeah so you got kids with the you may wanna might wanna yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand eight sure about what the song yes please check [laughter]\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning a that this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nYeah\nGeorge headquarters of\nYeah [laughter] but it's a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you guys are\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm definitely newer and\nWhat are you calling me and I'm the same\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook and these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this\nSmall peaceful protest march\nWould turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook one of the opening shots Facebook triggered a horse in what would become a\nLoud but do Facebook rockets\nIn global\nBad embattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech\nViolence against roe kingdom mostly what we can say in what we can't save by like ... we\nCan see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet\n\nMr soccer America got to\nDo you use objectively prioritize or sensors speech oh\nCongresswoman we don't know if we're doing a censoring speech but there are types of ...\nWhat what really grabbed me was was\nAnd we don't even think about what we're doing is censoring speech but there are types of ...\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and die\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow\nWhich made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning in two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\nIn building right behind the protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employee is one on one of whom was actually in that room at that moment [laughter]\nAnd now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees [noise] All right ready\nSo at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind\nThis was in the early to thousands seismic changes and weaken the Internet hierarchy and this was like the deep dark path nice face time is now the most visited website to us so it's\nHad somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them\nIn front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook and on Lake meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like our reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of times\nWrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of\nContent and then that content along with an alert\nWould would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were seeing was either\nNaked people blown off heads or\nThings that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a\nPhoto of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out\nAnd at the time if you didn't know what to do you turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't know when you Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard or what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one page long\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it out until\nFriday's fight for the rights that\nBreath anyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically\nEnough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just don't take up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then change their status\nThe title of our group a face of breastfeeding is not a team and they caught on social networking website is under fire for any policy on photos of women leading\nIn the face of breastfeeding is not a team and they caught on social networking website is under fire for any policy on photos of women brand new meeting their sheltering twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in the face to face the\nBecause they've gone through something like Seventy million users to to point to the ...\nCampaign would say it's about eighty floors and\nThey've gone for twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nThere's a floor in this building where faith but as far as the content moderators so\nAround twenty can they decided to start outsourcing some of the fork to places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora home and draw as well as\nI Would guess that there are things\nDublin where we sent reporters Garrett stack\nScene where the guys are still should say secrete\nEverybody fever English and we\nSend them there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow what we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like\n[noise] well I'm\nGenerally we found\nOut pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nUntil there's a lot of renting infamy happening\nA lot of all the good work and\nNow I don't have money you\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's so there's there's something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to do you want to be named or do you know or do you not want to be named\n... that's totally fine you know I was going to want to move up here\nExplain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to find these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk\nThe moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract prohibit any ... about ...\nMine several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it did create a sort of separation between these workers and the company which if your Facebook you might want\nTo I I signed up to monitor traffic I let us\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have ... and Kelly you guys are so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones like\nLike like like a big no or ...\nCase by case by case by case forty five ... every day it was just an edge as an image just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\nIf if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nAll of that just like they all the ... um it's too dangerous to X. rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nSettled had to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know ... like\n[noise] Thirteen year old girl I'm having sex with a play and it's got just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up and not as you did did you\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh he'd\nCatch themselves thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had just started voting things\nThat were there were specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so ... ... and I say at a time that I like Ike heads were exploding like nope nope I have to walk away\nAnd I just I have that I chose to real [noise] I I saw that\nIt's like I have to walk away and I just I had that I chose to wheel [noise] I I saw that [noise] it's it's a classic case yes to a different\nModerator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of this stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they are going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and it and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorists propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that they yeah they uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook huh\nBut a moving onto our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be jokes and readers hey All

with their kids in the room might want to sit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty third ticket is right around\nIn ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April Fifteen to twenty

fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly loaded going viral [noise]\nWe realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform it it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it\nBelieve new context so they got their team together sat down at a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see a bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down here however half the rooms says\nNo the other people are saying this as newsworthy\nEventually this photo is being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the\nGuidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down yes oh yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want\nOr yeah it is it now and news organizations friends' parents\nLet me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get the one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly\nYeah it is it now and news organization\nTrends parents who are going to get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact did even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook\nWhich are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest\nCenter this is a a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that's incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)",
