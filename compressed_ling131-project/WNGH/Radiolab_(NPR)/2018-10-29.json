on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people did Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up too tense and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other two campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again [noise]\nUm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them\nAre the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real basically he had he had to each of them by themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied [noise]\nSo after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad will say I've been told him\nWhat was happening with the man is ... with his back and I\nHad been five times and the cat\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol and melon Alfie ran through the woods [noise]\nDemand caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer\nHe took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come\nMen that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than a killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot and the man with a gun just kind of stood up and\nCalmly and Cooley walked into the forest and thus began what\nWas it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in the state police standing by\nOur there was the scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a ... for trolls\nMen armed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nSay eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID\nEight thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today\nHe was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape here seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are shorter large people\nLoaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and we've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers\nDemand has done what happened was Carol was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men or\nThe police follow elite that he had stolen car and he had been cited and me they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... Blanca spotted gal said freeze or cap you got something to that fact and scare started running a little black\nSpotted Darrow said breeze or drop your gun something of that fact and scare started running\nA little black fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put him in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing but he wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this is a law professor release alarm and again he's\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do and what a good person should do\nIn the situation\nAnd we are recording the guy at the center of this conflict was\nA man named Frank our money frankly age aren't many brand\nIs a lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and so they use urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers time and I learned I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York is our money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for a rubber\nGirl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid\nHe got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go for it like standing up for the little guy\nThat's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for her defended you're fighting the state and ... and he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert Guerra yeah\nYou're fighting this state and ...\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation\nThen he met Robert De Niro yeah do I care strong back to take him out you need a forty five and a a to Z had the feeling that this guy is dangerous love of the things are going to happen\nTake off to go look for the bodies arrows told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine\nShaft the mine ... mine ... about an hour south of the hospital in Iran and in that moment where you scared were you excited label you up high ... high but you're scared you're concerned you for your food for you do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police [noise]\nSo then surely they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm\nLady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talked to her ... her car and then\nWe went up to big door [noise]\nTook of driving that lady friends car to try to lose too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here ... as far as\nWe walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nGoing out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and\n... pounds supervisor of Mariah Tom's cause a father says it's on a road that goes to the mine is or what is clear to them on [noise] it was that sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nWas very icy that day\nThis here is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills\nThis hair issues to be an overall\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills fairly the ... and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came and hair\nCells right up there so here we are in our Sunday suits and recalls trudging choose for is looking for the [noise]\nBut no worse look [noise]\nThe phones were barefoot you see the airship\nAfter they find this air shaft which was just a hole in the ground in a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for this is good and he said yeah you don't want to slide down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then they'll see how my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak [noise]\nOn blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself this bitch does it end he yells back up to Belgium get me out of the year\n... backup none\nTruly bell gee found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her\nBut our money wasn't there when delta G founder so what ensued was a very long struggle where the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about\nThe bodies of these girls ... yeah that play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep\nWe're the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just care we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current\nRules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there is no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired detectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there is no if if if the people are already dead then you ... the the lawyers shoe\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates\nEven as everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for their client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of plant or also citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system when there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens if there are ... you're building on on the side of tell just tell\nTale of course yeah soon I knew Mr ... from ... goes to the other daughter my daughter were in the same flash and I knew him from church and\nOne thing to be and then I'm On the [noise] the ...\nThe parents\nOne to be and then I'm On the [noise] the big\n... the parents\nOf the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two wars morality [noise]\nSo now what does she [noise] coming up that hard fought gets even harder [noise] we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is a journey from Arlington, Texas radiolab supported in part by the

P. B. okay hey I'm Janice\nNight at eight unless they're supported G. P. B. okay\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich who's radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral do when we left it there were where they were stuck right there when they knew this thing but it was a client was very guilty of something they'd found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move well\nSo they decided to put the bird plea bargain\nThey take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients to\nGet ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage\nThat was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her lunar you're going to take a little well that's kind of gross you know\nAn investigation into the ethical complain\nThat would drag on several years\nBell gee started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or money topped it out but he suffered\nA no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore or were sick you know well what else can I Do [noise] to make your living he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the older the stress and pressure\nShould Trump toll\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and the the state bar the Belgian or money did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven\nThe difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money\nIs that our money is a real person and they told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage a featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love\nFeast does what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNever dreamed that [noise]\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer the director's job I was a good lawyer [noise]\nSo I thought so\nArt everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a\nGood body is case taught in law schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if you will face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've been in sitting in on these\nClasses and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because pressure's can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation\nThis is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\nMm\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which\nProved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding\nWith a family member of one of the victims\nAs she initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on a phone call would you mind um\nHe ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record okay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nWho's in the girl from Chicago She was a college student who had gone missing while she's camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mind you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\n'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nSleep there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um [noise] when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli the lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nShow anyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach this as it's with a lot of\nSensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate some of that\nExperience yeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess uh [noise]\nI'm Wondering ... we've been talking a lot of that stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nYou want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree pass to mostly uh we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where we're too difficult for us and um [noise]\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship Herbert any a graduate\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had to get that summer and he had a full scholarship any uh graduated just before and I and I'm sure the other two children get\nGreat future had a true and it's just a horrible tragedy\nHorrible you know to be in the position\nTo live [noise]\nI mean how do you relate to lose your your daughter [noise]\nUm what what excuse who's the for\nProtecting the person that killed her\nNo justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it\nThat's the way it is [noise]\nOr [noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city":
