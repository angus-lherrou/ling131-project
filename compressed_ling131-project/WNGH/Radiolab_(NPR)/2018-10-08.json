I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nThey're gonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter] [laughter] okay so I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it\nWhat are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start again that was what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again in\nHow many people do is be killed in the United states comes out by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like ... what we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire me right Asian Harris than to budge on er and will to come sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like number one\nThere a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know we have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere with\nThe problem is we don't know we have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many ... there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete because most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors\nThought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented [noise] so first study had Florida since a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful\nPublic records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... and got promoted bend sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida I think\nThree hundred and eighty eight emails to asking for five\nYears worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not\nThis involves a year of work county police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know for\nBack we send our producer ... down to the Tampa Bay times always with them right here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this to this is probably five thousand pages\nAt a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me six six feet tall we've got to be broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county\n... boy and beach uh all the way through\nThe alphabet and he basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the desk\nAnd the combination of a use of force reports it's civil court records\nAnd media clippings the represent\nHundred and thirty one shootings\nAnd media clippings the represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nHope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and and six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo he did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect or chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those ... than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYeah hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime some of the things have been found it initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt\nTo think as a weapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that\nPeople who cover police apparently know quite well you know the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was news to us I mean clearly\nPolice are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country\nBut when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nNear what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and as we've that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk with numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we had these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but to further down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far and presents to kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one\nUltimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah the ... I mean [noise] I mean what's\nGets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWe were and why we want to start this methane gas bill just moved by the single cases individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nI mean they're all written in this ah deployment investigations revealed that a U.S PT officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this is the Cato as Daryl police speak Fowler\nApproach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife and apartment to five five but every one of these every report is at least one human life if someone was either\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being in that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has never been charged and\nSo it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah it's like past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of read\nAfter the event ended at community center crystal took a bunch of them on the on their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nAnd so he had given every every event or a no no I just wanted to know inland and has been telling everyone about ...\nDe ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nYou know we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping remind right we all just simply trying\nOur way of their first of all gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at there and going because it was talking to him in and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nThat album I windows and I just knew will go on to my house she says page comes or down beyond just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\n\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house and the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking Jews talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n[noise]\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\nAnd now we're redoing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we started to fail rate of how\nSee each other head on the couch you know I'm imagining it becomes like a huge sleep over and first of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other a lot of time or the vice over his shoulder like therapy for\nClinton but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that\nMarlon problems to\nWin crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlin was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people him in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grad so we usually the video that\nHouse probably over like right\nThe police car that came behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\nThat's why we call the execution a vegetable garden cos\nThat I Am then\nWhen a when you know when they took him away in released into it\nThat but I I Am then\nWhen they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back here all you can smell what's going\nOn now like when you play any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the associates Michael when I'm quite onions and you get a smell like it just\nAre actually brings you right back here ...\nIn the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\nArticles I just started ... some of the other one that started crying\nYou don't want me to uh take some yeah yeah my find to be a lot of what a ... a couple of women had to be their own mind\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who\nThey just there to the camera\nWith this sort of straight face at three two one\nThree two one\nStarted walking back to the cars\nVarious ... we saw that last week and I\nAnd I threw a clock in the morning and\nI remember the and I used to tell you how do you live so far away\nAll my gosh that was that was\nAre up and where\nTo go there all the time of horror\nOr yeah that was Lloyd how could you not\nYou know like you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because by it but with an s a cemetery\nI Know like you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nI mean it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm\nAnd it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every day\nAnd I do a little white man we share everything with it but he literally I think he does he like go have lunch every day\nMy dad has to be or not if it's a similar the way I like going on and all of that a little while I got to always say not do\nYou think his chair a gamble holes\nTrip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can either repeal who was the mother is ... she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother I\nWas loaded into the ground\nAround the time of the few these women started call themselves the mothers of the book but\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nIt was weird because in this short amount of time\nThing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group\nAnd suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun a man with a knife and a look at the razor thin life or death moment between the end it there\nDamn accompli the gun a man with a knife\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment between them and if\nYou're going to get so stay with us [noise]\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhance the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about Sloan not W. W. W. dot ... dot org and\nThat's the kind of talking to them cop were in the body can end this black man goes on race pretty negative than any walking towards the cops once\nYou start learning so crazy [noise]\nLike I gets closer and closer and closer and finally the couple in the body chemicals out ... the other officer at it was added a frame is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nI hunted down\nIs approaching approaching approaching approaching me gets within like ten feet of the cops and then\n\nThe guy was funny campfires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on it just like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand painted\nHey you're going to get it again\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the nights out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she's been changed central four cups and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming out I mean you're\nLucky you didn't just shot I wanted to your best shot and see if you want to die if you want a dog you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police force can kill\nTheir fan of talents or do you want\nMe to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN\nCounseling on his\nFeet to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and then you went\nTo said this is the thing that you guys will you use this video for what it says one of a multitude of videos that we show officers when the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans unicorns has died when I mean they are now you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first worn and let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard that you might have different things we reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nBread I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in a faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a report that made the officer think about how he's going to deal with this thing\nLove\nActually after he finished watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nInvited through the neighborhood I miss it on the front step waves of ... what are you doing man that dared does stupid son of a bitch you and how close came to be in that wouldn't be backwards medication I wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners they told him he just ... heads out militia ... why she would was elected sheriff of\nLinn county\nIs the county that Daytona Beach belongs to them and the other thing you mentioned is that a typical on his organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nThe tone of each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a chip on his organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition of police chief twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being some in law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest pleasing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly\nDespite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women who uh I've become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are\nPossibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of thought the same\nWay too but [noise]\nI mean\nThere was his experience than I had read realized\nHope has to go [noise]\nThat's coming
