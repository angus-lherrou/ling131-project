Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in him or thinks are pretty startling levy because of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem a tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage for all the time you know three syllables\nPer line it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and long and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that are still not by heart diplomas basically a get well card it's written by this guy ... who was a poet in the early Eighteen hundreds at the\nCourt of queen\nAnd he wrote the palm for uh just queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very\nSweet could you said and Frank let's just here at first yeah okay it's called\nA ... done was that in ... to a sick demos\n... so to speak ... of the young lady [noise]\nMoney and you're in a group who doesn't who ... who knew the ... ... ... to beat them all ... to\n... see onto the taboo ... coffee to sit you do have to hold my led a coup to a ... a pill doggone boom poor to dwell on the bone in young\nGuy didn't have gotten so many chicks when you were I was actually\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so you read the poem files it away deepen the corner of his mind fast what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decided to have a translate into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home\nThinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and\nAll of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what I meant was to set we here's the thing he says he got this pump money none of them doesn't loom\nFrom and if you just focus on the words it's basically just the guy talking to a younger girls saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like ... I ... to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam goofy too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your plump shape bell dog units are like get better here's to your good health\nTo dwell on the boat and I mean young\nNot just saying those words in English misses the whole\nSpirit of the ... the tone the light hearted mess and and this is key for Doug ... also known as the pumps form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know a\nB. B. C. C. D. D. and uh the first line mom union is identical\nTo the last line I mean young to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems they've known to Vermont oh and I forgot that I say three syllables per allow you didn't ya yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became\nEmbroiled in the question of like how do you translate this coming along the way he began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines at the ... for example\nVast beyond the taboo ... like this land that basically says don't wallow in bed I had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal\nDisplay here instead of hurting blood in bed instead\nOf burping in your bed instead of bursting out in bed instead of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their can instead of squirming in your head of slurping flop in in the dead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ...\nMy sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick\nSheer all the best you're forced to rest is like jail so don't ale very long just gets strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you're a ... for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health be near my sweet dear\nSo Clay Moltz is now Douglas Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the ones on Jan became bread though ordered the bread and butter butter bread\nYeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concept and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly ear implicitly\nTalking about bread and things that you spread it on ... just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent the ... to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health\nDress and fleet off with Clement\nVery different in tone\nAnd really quite marvelous\nYou got the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient which you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but ... says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and twenty eight was a sacrosanct number so that's just two lines so no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the thing funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nails before he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nStudents who my sweet treat one regard motives hard ... who's colleagues friends chicken\nNot to like sixty people doctoral students who my sweet treat one regard motives hard ... colleagues friends chicken D.
