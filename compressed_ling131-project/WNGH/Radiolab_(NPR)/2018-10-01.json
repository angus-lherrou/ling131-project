Kennedy Airport of course we'll play someone to go get away from\nWe hadn't actually meant to come up with the guy that we had been interviewing\nVoters for large it'd be portrayed by demeanor and the rest of your heart emotional and right in the middle of the interview he'd gotten a call alert all said he had to run or that's where you are really crap we have more questions all ready to do so we decided to jump in the car\nWith big guns well yes we've got to look like they're in combat uniform for Iraq that have automatic weapon\nNegate the Paul ... when he carries a a security expert rats would even be called nowadays and speaking of security and the reason he's here today at JFK Airport in to talk with Jerry Lewis security over\nPiece in the ... things about how they might do their jobs better okay we have a lot of a\nNot a joke but by the security kicks is out there\nAnd the only place that teams were allowed to stand other right here on the concrete nearing two lanes of traffic were ... finally pulled out the thing he\nReally the terminal from the only place it seems we're allowed to stand other right here on the concrete nearing two lanes of traffic were ... finally pulled out the thing he'd been hoping to show the folks that Jet Blue\nHas your little you're very stylish little laptops they are just starting off the simple computer program that he promises that forty minutes\nHere into a person who chose a store and click start alright things start\nTo the computer hears loading images say they'll have a best\nWay to reach\nUh I see that one again that was so fast\nWhoa\nIs happening I promise I'll tell you but let me ask you going\nTo explain Paul ... studies faces the human face he's probably studied to face more than anyone\nUp at my work that was supposed to send me\nWe didn't really know how many expressions of face could make and there was nothing like a musical notation for the phrase so\nAbout Thirty years ago he began by examining his own face very closely to see how many muscles are in there and there are roughly fifty then he spent the next couple of decades trying to figure out how many ways those muscles can combine to form a facial ...\nDeveloped tropical fish washing coding system\nBasically a muscular scoring system where you could apply to photograph film ... be a writer who just did a a one to for your your numbering my facial expression that went to the most common finger direct to his raising your eyebrows ... as far as just raising the upper arm it\nSays on his concerns are are\nAll in all the human face is capable of three thousand different expression that's what he thinks it's we sat in his publishers office in midtown Manhattan is about an hour before the airport incident where the example yeah he demonstrated a few\nA few fabricate anger very unlikely you'll put in what we call the anger reliable muscle which most people can't voluntarily move the anger reliable my ...\nI Want to see his\nEars and the thing you are\nTouching their red margin of ...\nEarly ... you looked fierce when you do that instantly so if you want to know someone's mad look at their lips conversely if you want to know they're happy genuinely happy and they're not just faking it he says look at their islets\nSkin in between your eyebrows and Europe or\nOne other happy think genuinely happy and they're not just faking it he says look at their islets\nCan in between your eyebrows and Europe or are they in a genuine spontaneous and joins while pets can lose lightly down\nHard to detect a bug visible you know what you just did it when you said\nThat anyway the reason that we're talking about him here in our on lying is because with all the attention that's being paid these days to finding lives by using fancy brain scanners X. men is kind of on a crusade to remind us that you don't have to do that you don't have to look in the brain because the brain is actually directly connected to the face\nIn ways that we can't control these muscles are activated involuntarily when an emotion and curves without your choice\nOr the things happening on my face on her face on any faith record on there and do you know ... to make your face [laughter]\nWhich brings me to my new favorite word\nLeakage leakage leakage yes it is a word you will hear again and again when you talk to anyone in the field apply catching\nTake for example Barry McManus aerial McManus em CNN us longtime CIA interrogator physiological leakage\nCould be anywhere from sweat gland activity when someone knows that they are misleading you and they break out in a sweat\nThat because of ... nervous system that you have no control over basically telling the truth is easy that is the crux of it ... Steve Silverman a reporter for wired magazine the truth is kind of sitting there in your brain your brain knows it you say it no problem but your brain has to work harder to generate the line there is an effort\nAnd with that there is always leakage even in an instantaneous moments sometimes you even hear it were a person's breathing pattern will change or the size that people do and what particular time did they do a you're not trained to look at it most people ignore it\nBut if you've been trained and you know what to look for ... it will strike you right in the face speaking\nFaces are talking about a peculiar brand ... specializes in had to do with something that he called\nMicro facial expression or very fast\nFacial expression about twenty fits with a second\nOkay just to just as an example let's just let us imagine that you're smiling\nGames but on the inside of us who know you can attest maybe you got some rage a little little being all that but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is went for the tiniest tiniest moment a little bit of that\nYou got some rage a little little slit but on the outside you're smiling now a microexpression is went for the tiniest tiniest moment a little bit of that in a rage slips out on your face\nThat they went out again and then they went ... and ... all of their time together\nWell I don't remember when\nIt turned at some point she started to have a lot of problems small crises started to come out a whole series I think they were the problems insurance problems\nYou know I've got a situation where I Need to move out of the place where I'm currently living as it's because my roommates you know crazy he\nFelt himself sort of pulling back yes yes into one evening he gets a call from her and she's totally passage\nThat you have to come over we have something we really need to talk about it at this point I have no idea what it is now at this time but ah she said\nHey I'm pregnant [noise] I think I'm pregnant\nWell what did you do\nWell he basically ... up and did the right thing\nThere really was a part of me that was thinking well here's the test of a person\nThat's going to stand by her and support her through the pregnancy and he said okay let's go to the doctor together\nI Would say where when I Want to be there and she would say three o'clock at\nThe doctor's office than I Would say okay and I would go\nSee the early you know to forty five\nAnd uh she would not be there at three Fifteen would roll around and three thirty would rather around there I Am sitting sort of alone in the perception is sort of ... can I help you\nShe would say oh well that that one was at one o'clock or I Would notice on the sign in sheet that she had actually signed in and I could see the handwriting was indeed it was hopes and she signed it two hours earlier\nYeah oh yeah yeah and as this continued I Would say repeat that for me three okay so three o'clock I mean these are moments in which will clarity of life you're not losing track of stuff\nThen he got the call from a woman named Leslie I met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture\nShe showed up with just all of her ...\nA woman named Leslie I met hope off Craig's list actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture\nShe showed up with just all of her stuff in trash bags and then she disappeared\nLeaving the back behind so it was right around the point where a check bounced and I was like oh now and so through a mutual friend she tracked\nDown shoot I was kind of like OK well she has a boyfriend she called them called them and sort of wanted like is he in on this issue to had no idea what she's talking about no he didn't even know she had a roommate name's Leslie I mean\nWho the hell was who are you know who were you you will need money I knew I don't and she'll you know it was all very confusing\nNot knowing what else to do Leslie decides to go into hopes for him and start looking through her son I just like you know I'm just going to go through to see what's in here\nAnd that's when I found those notebooks [noise]\nBorrow bound up on an inside literally pages upon pages of different names with different social next to them\nCredit card numbers mother's maiden name birth date page after page of that kind of information what exactly was is these are ... notes for con woman that's when I called Jude and I said get over here\nWhy did you do at this point well dude knew he had to do something I finally got up the courage\nTo confront hope and say\nMy own responsibilities you're not withstanding to be um\nKnow pregnancy and what about Leslie at this point we she well Leslie wonder how many of those people in that notebook hoping that through Craig's list which is where Langley but her so she went back to Craig's list and started posting warnings many times\nA day I think they were white female make specific I mean the Gray Thursday like twenty something close\nBlonde right away run away in fact when your hairdresser she's hosting morning after the morning if you have any information about the person or simply wants them to the police email ... Khan but I Hope at Yahoo dot com and credit\nTook them all down as incorrect from Craig's list ... remarks soldier folks where he thought that they were inappropriate they were unfairly do the right thing with everyone knows right she would pass the drama and not only would take down\nShe would pose a fact of the matter is I Hope is out there somewhere he would take it down but within a few days in those moments where I was in the bathroom away from his desk\nPeople respond to stories and the volt poured she people\nEvery different kind of person from all over the place yoga instructors landlords are mechanics flower shop owners ...\nAll over the place yoga instructors landlords are mechanics flower shop owners ...\nCashing place at the dollar\nAnd everybody was same story she won\n... seems to be living with the staff signs part of the girls had been checked out of the clergy count\nCourse that that really here\nShe got kind of a celebrity following by the way we used to get emails like every day for people who were just like\nIs there any student loves he knows he's tell us anything I'm like no she doesn't either ... or ... who was this woman\nAnd here you can I get you to introduce yourselves maybe around what you do [laughter] my name is\nTerri Larry oh I'm a special agent with the Louisiana department of justice\nLouisiana how'd you get to Louisiana but after a few years and hope pre surfaced in an oil if\nWe had a call and complain to from a lady down in the New Orleans area or her credit card had been used someone to try to purchase Dell computers\nAnd it just started from there every time we talked to one victim to lead to want it to other ... hope has a almost like a cult following you know hurry ammo was that\nShe knew she got to know really well I talked to a lot of victims and they just don't trust people anymore a lot of these people did some good Schumann open heart things with her and said this to poor girl I've got to help her out\nAnd there were there really let down there just don't trust people anymore and it's sad you know not only do you have to worry about cleared up your credit than getting your money back from your bags you know you've got to deal with with people on the ... you don't know you know who you're standing next to\nHit it had that feeling\nOne of the house is that how that boundary and San Francisco he had found something that was really a pack I had\nCome across a letter but she had written here my parents but never male and things very very terrible things but ... says ...\nIn this letter to his parents help for that\nOne point during\nPregnancy she was having complications and the main symptom was blank severe badge and were bleeding and bad news is that she was on somebody's living room for a minor hers in this terrible condition and that um\nThat she was on somebody's living room floor added minor hers and it's terrible condition and bad I'm\nTotally abandoning the situation at my responsibility in\nJust a graphic and ugly depiction of an awful the\nCheapest traumatized\nThe whole experience he compared to an earthquake [noise]\nPet either been an earthquake never well one of the things that happens is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and there for a little while after the earthquake you're not sure\nThat when you put your foot down the ground is still going to be in the same place as it was a minute ago there were days\nI can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say anything any consequences that was just\nI have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires on September ...\nBut it didn't say so Denver Nineteen or September fifteenth potential temper Seventeen to other\nPeople crying on the phone talking to me about the situation and they were victims six seven years ago people are embarrassed they're embarrassed and then they become bad\nYou know and that's when they become detective [laughter]\nWhere are you know front of hopes mothers have in\nOr a midnight what's your name and her mom Marcia Valentine then why are you there exactly I could kind of gotten a little tough to have you gotten upset\nNo idea either\nThere was something about ...\nShe was doing all this cylinder was really fun to imagine but maybe also happens Leslie too but like once I started looking I was able to find a lot of victims a lot of information and I wanted to meet her [noise]\nAround around here that are on the border you'd be happy with what we're\nOkay next right ... well what did you know about hope at this point well I knew she had had a daughter really anybody\nRight well what what did you know about hope at this point well I knew she had had a daughter\nReally anybody\nTo know not choose\nThe timing was all wrong\nAnd I had located the father well standing outside of hooks mother's house\nLike I Can't see anyone inside\nNext morning I went out\nTo find a woman named ruby ruby moon I live in New Orleans Louisiana where the on the coffee shop I live down the street from hoped mother someone hope came to New Orleans um her mother you know introduced a ruby has a kid who's about the same age hope daughter and they go to Montessori together\nAnd when Rudy opened her shop a year ago\nHope to car pool today she would\nPick them up and when we got home about five thirty six o'clock we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes and quite frankly I enjoyed having hope around\nLike a temp agency where you know you would go if you type sixty words a minute kind of place is exactly exactly this is the notion that you played a bunch of lawyers or the ... will hurt her ridiculous ridiculous every her idea was that liars would be over represented at a temp agency\nAnd you can probably imagine you know people who need to go to the temp agency are usually people who cannot remain one job for very long period of time\nThat's not true of all people who work at a temp agencies most of them are just fine but some of them she figured keep ending up at the temp agency because they just have this\nProblem with their you know their lifestyle the truth ... let's keep going I Want to hear how this comes out to make it\nSo yelling in her crew went to a couple of temp agencies in the LA area interviewed a hundred and eight people\nFrom all kinds of questions not just about their employment history but about their past their childhood history or their families their personnel information checked their answers to those questions against their family and friends against their court records just to see if she could find people who stories and\nYou know inconsistencies big ones\nAnd then the hundred and eight folks that she ... she found a pathological liar twelve actually twelve twelve a hundred and they'd say abortion or they pathological Arizona depends on how you defined I Would hope that she found twelve people that you wanted to look at further she said to them would you be willing to come\nAnd they say a ... or they pathological or an it depends on how you define as hope but she found twelve people that she wanted to look at further she said to them would you be willing to come on a purely voluntary basis into the lab and let me scan your brain [laughter]\nJust another day but to\nActually put people in the scanner and then we scan their\nBang chicken everyone's ... all one hundred and eight or ... participants the liars and the non liars no one knew which group there and ... and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just beyond therefore it called the ... corps tax oh\nThis is a part of the brain that part of the nation is where the real thinking at making decisions and lord judgment for example\nNow if you do me into that place just behind your forehead [noise]\nWhat you'll see two kinds of brain tissue you've got\nGray matter and then you've got white matter I've heard of gray matter yes well we we think of the brain is being gray but actually it's too thick gray and white the great stuff kind of think of it was like the computer processor part yeah these little clumps of neurons to process information\n[noise] computer [noise]\nThat's the great where's the white white matter it's like that the connections between now just because of the computer in the way met her in other words is what moves the thoughts around gray is where the the thinking happens and then why is when you move the thought from here [noise]\nThey transfer inflation from one end to the ...\nBecause they've got your grave that you're white what y'all lean thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people who ... I found out we see a reduction in some piece of it not they're missing some things is ugly she thought she would find less gray stuff less of the thinking why would why would\nWhy because that's what she's seen in other mental disorders that are kind of like this and if you think about it in a really simplistic level the graves where you think your thoughts and it's also among other things where you crunch moral calculations and liars she figured have trouble in this department some maybe they have ...\nThat was okay but when she got the pictures back what you saw was such a great increase\nWhite stuff a lot more twenty five cents a quarter to twenty five twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes\nBefore we get to what that means what\nA lot more twenty five and a quarter to twenty five twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes\nBefore we get to what that means what were you thinking when you saw this\nI really bubbling\nI thought this was this was something something something something shift\nGears her idea so far ready yeah she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in a kind of in the moments storytelling that's essentially what lying is coming up with a story on the fly let me give you an example kept you're leaving work you're\nYou're on the bitter end up going\nBut nice co worker corners you hey Sallie corners you in\nThe elevator hey\nYou know I've been meaning to ask you you maybe want to go out with me on friday\nQuestions dangling in the air it's more\nSo for most of us right at that moment in their head and our brains were thinking\nMaybe why why why would he really was I think think think reaching out into the void trying to form a connection with some ideas that can help you come up with some excuse I can say I'm like well I'm ... [noise]\nAnd really what you need to do at this moment is you take a bunch of disparate thoughts on different sides of your brain like um to me tonight teeth dentist and connecting altogether\nLate nights on hold out like that OK okay we can all\nDo it given enough time but for the pathological liar she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to\nBegin with they get their faster at night and you are in the morning and I have to pass yoga I ... I thought he might make\nThem more connection Barry beekeeping ... than the speed of the hottest thing altogether jump from one idea to another and you can come up with more on random stories\nShe thinks the brains of most of us we have trouble making those connections we have when you're in trouble as I said you're going to come out with you know friday night would you not be able to come up with a ...\nI Would say um yeah I um\nI have to try to count straws to assert search you know destruction I mean we always we have about three hundred and sixteenth stress over and uh I'm only I'm only doing ones with with um with little red circles on them so that's there's you know sorry [laughter]\nI don't know I just was up there you go see you've got you've got extra weight met her so she says\nCircles on them so that's there's you know sorry [laughter]\nI don't know I did this happen there you go see you've got you've got extra white men or perhaps so she's saying this is a cause of lying or ineffective lie\nLike well she's not sure and this is a big debate in which he can say is that children as they grow from eight to eight ten there is a big job in the white\nMatter oh and that's it and seeing the same age that they give up the skill to lie\nAmong the\nClothes ... given everything we've just talked about how do you square this\nInformation with being a new mom I mean is this your first good yes it's my first one a boy or girl again yeah what's her name ... doesn't it make you wonder a little bit about Zoe and what's what's going on inside her head\nOh yes I Wonder about that all the times it's still too early to scan her brain but eventually I Will do it are you serious yes\nThis is a moral to this never if you were a little baby have a social psychiatrist as a mother to the very very dangerous thing anyway if she does this then maybe we'll do a little bit more about the nature nurture of liars but until then\nThis is radio lab and we'll be back in a moment\nIn your brain\nIs\nThis is listener supported G.
