toll and more than forty years and hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized\nWilliam Schaffner is medical director at the national foundation for infectious diseases\nWell it was an

options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these\nAre a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products available in the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years a stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but they're Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which badger says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured or to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half a\nOften carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care\nAnd generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... people have something called health insurance but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your house comes from exact

average Israeli I Would think\nShould go we don't govern the Palestinians we don't administer Ramallah engineering or not loose governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd or with the Palestinians are actually demanding something that would collapse of their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time but they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east and reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best way we could uh\nYou have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have a lot and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel\n[noise] uh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank\nWell first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good um we don't have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by us\nBut here's how it's done we have say intelligence about I'm a terrorist or in a one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to know why should we\nYou know and often we have to do because because we're willing to to take the risk within attack because we weren't yesterday the un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nFind internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very briefly I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do final thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you\nIs there also a risk in being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because he would rather as Israel historically has has\nBipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support in Israel is had a bipartisan support in and I believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that ah you know you've seen that we

Israelis citizen and what form would that take\nWell they would have those rights than their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government outgoing flag they have their own\nWell they have an even back now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians we don't administer Ramallah origin in or not loose governed by the Senate but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would endanger is\nNot this is a very odd or with the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel\nWe could have a lot and you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel\n[noise] uh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism and and the west bank\nWell first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good um who don't have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by us but here's how it's done\nWe have say intelligence about terrorists in um one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to [noise] why should we\nYou know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk within attack because we weren't at the un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nInternationally final thing minister because I Know your time is very brings I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do final thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you\nIs there also a risk in being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because he would rather as Israel historically has has\nBipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel has had a bipartisan support and and I believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you've seen that we could have agreements and disagreements with previous administrators was for example we had a\nYou know it's no secret of out of disagreement with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we signed an animal you are an animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the\nComing decade and and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements and you have a basic agreement about the importance of
