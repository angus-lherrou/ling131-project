stake this fall as Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage their relations for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group trying to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address\nWhat we're trying to deal with a problem with partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people let's\nBe blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that are slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\nNo I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will\nUh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their badge\nI don't think I'll criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand eighty\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty eight teams the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and we will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electrical effort as well\nUh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing and the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting lens so governors always matter a state legislators matter\nBut in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who's running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won the Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at\nIn a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench

will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ensure a a a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech major mature ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama knew\nWhen they go low we all know they go low\nWe what did you mean or what I meant ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful is that something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate [noise]\nWell I certainly think votes through protests um I I just say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going act them at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump inauguration was very powerful when young people marched here in

somehow when that is not necessarily good there could be a lot of problems with office full yeah sometimes not everybody knows who's in the group or out which could lead to some awkward conversations
