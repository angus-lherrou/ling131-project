expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test avenue nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nIn the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the ... on this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so on broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon too\nThat long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so on broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today it will also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having a testing\nOf this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it'd be good for the president to be able to speak directly to\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nQueen shudder to think that the president might be using such as that for political purposes or to create a diversion of the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure sure I I it'd be so one thing about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E a\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and it wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFEMA says that accusation is baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded well there is no opting out of the alert\nSystem is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message and besides he has Twitter for that\nBrian Naylor NPR News Washington\nComing up later today on all things considered we'll hear from one of the beneficiary of the new NAFTA trade deal present sometime this week it
