tough for Trump personally to do anything that would want to damage\nThis relationship with is one thing we know from Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow a human rights abuses at uh in in another country to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship\nUm you see what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you were earlier\nA presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist and Turkish soil or I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going\nTrue in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil ah I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be hell to pay isn't that going to increase pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure it will I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President putting in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but\nWe're not talking about that anymore um look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific for the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in\nThe American allies conflict brought by the way\nBut I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured it what what is interesting of course is the ability\nOf the Senate and others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen\n'em ... increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur these heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially\nBecause Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or at it after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together [noise]\nIs this a government known for intimidating their

contains five legendary albums featuring some of Cuba's plaintiff musician these recordings were made in Havana pan art studios between Nineteen\nFifty six and Nineteen sixty four that's the period just before communist leader Fidel Castro nationalize the recording industry and since then these albums have become extremely hard to come by\nUntil now that is that that is called the complete Cuban jam sessions volumes one through five and here to talk about it is Felix Contreras host of NPR's all Latino podcast they feel like Hey David what's happening\n[noise] will I'm enjoying the music actually it was there's very little Cuban music ... claiming that I don't like to get a special [noise]\nFirst of all the studio studio was the best video in Cuba so that virtually every major Cuban artist hadn't played at some point or another and these sessions or from after hours Jeff Sessions after the musicians played the gigs that places like the hotel must you know and the really opulent

would just go into the room and just started playing\nAnd the owner of the studio rent tape the whole time sometimes between ten PM in six AM\nWhile 'til the sun would come out there you go so what happened exactly when Castro came to power okay eventually he nationalized the recording industry and the bureaucrats takeover right and the free wheeling bohemian themed suffered a little bit because the government felt there was a reflection of the decade next to the United states\nSo the owners of the studio were concerned about what was going to happen with the masters of what was going to happen to the style of music so they started taking these masters\nAnd smuggling them out of the country and depositing them in different Latin American countries along the way so what happened to those recordings over the years in hiding eventually they were sold at different labels in Latin America over the years some shoddy reproductions were produced along the way but most of the albums became incredibly hard to find\nSo finally a couple of years ago California label craft recordings bought this Mexican label that was holding on to these tapes and they've figured out what they were holding and he decided to put something like this together [noise]\nSome of the highlights what stands out okay there's one in particular that I called the crown jewel of the of the collection is
