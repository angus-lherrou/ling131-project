back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nDidn't have any needles stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge but medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it had a ... engine does it have

times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this version is being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred

it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nA lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a buck forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise] uh yeah it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test out\nOf sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it\nThis is much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary\nSo everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nWhat could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much thanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health

Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey ... the restoration of national pride and I

basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to\nPut a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means they're few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary\nSo everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive\nAsk what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skinned\nArson prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage

huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who was reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and the union for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehend\nAnd and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride and I think that it helps explain why both now defeated the workers' party candidate financial and Daschle so comprehensively [laughter]\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the surviving adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo try to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they say is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's essential issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nDays rainy on it he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any race and I don't believe that I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license\nHe'll say believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ... yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder or a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worry about it most of that people are especially
