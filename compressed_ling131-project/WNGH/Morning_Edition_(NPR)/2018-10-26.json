several public figures who've been mailed what are believed to be pipe bombs this week\nCirrhosis a hedge fund investor and philanthropists who donated to causes many of them progressive around the

target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs or just surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list serve you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack\nThat I wouldn't be surprised to see store service on that list I think he is the single most important moment politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how\nSpearheading progressive causes worldwide\nHas a really interesting personal history how about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen Seventy two well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary or his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that trauma explains a lot about the focus of his finance or being his politics and their life\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trade and so that by around Nineteen eighty\nHe was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties a specialty whereas a currency peg than looked\nUnsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England\nCouldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and win sources right or the pound collapse are made enough food for sure and and the u._k. economy a descended into some chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIt again in his native Hungary and then and other Eastern

that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans are and it became a useful trick\nIf you were being attacked in the media and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the media was slurring me because of sort of saw us and his allies have put them up to it\nJust to sort of some peculiar become seen as a shadowy figure hiding in talk is it just because he had so much

goes through manipulate the politicians and so forth I think it's an indication of that tradition\nWell why do people in his native hungry think of Soros\nHim as a hero or early on in the transition

Halloween costumes\nIt was a controversy on the outskirts of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like she wants to look like they interrupt her one day I I don't know how like that got raises hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white she says it was a white man to\nUs about her history of making racialized comments\nWill these aren't uh the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty or ... the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking him last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately the started criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over ...\nPretty neat tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers or one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a friend just for about ten minutes to she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously uh one more example of among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about the question of a African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed him on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged who her remarks about uh what she thought was the acceptability of blackface NBC's\nNightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something and at making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nFor you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces in t._v. news which is really interesting\nThe fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments say something bigger about the way networks and companies are are Tyler I it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she's been discussing with a network another role there uh because uh she needed to get out of that show now the show's

was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white Jesus was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWill these aren't uh the only

about uh what she thought was the acceptability of blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something in that making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nFor you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the

of the most recognizable faces in t._v. news which is really interesting\nThe fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled

direction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accused are former boss at Fox News of
