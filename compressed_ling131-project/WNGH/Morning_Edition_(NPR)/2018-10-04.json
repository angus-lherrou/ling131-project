kids\nI talked with William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers [noise]\nThat's right I mean it was it was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on edge\nYeah that's right I mean it was it was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened [noise]\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they are very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very to time and women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about ... ... as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the anointed mothers of angels [noise]\nUh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ...

and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children on may not even survive beyond a year so I'm well how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of those children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean butts on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well I I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most as\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age\nCan stand there was some

I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they don't know why it affected one twin and another ... ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that the affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families had a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access to school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what they're going to do about child care and and\nSo we were able to join um the the actress him on as
