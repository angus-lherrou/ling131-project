Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about my whole long\nHallway is sixty four years old he served as device ministry of public security bureau issues China's national police are in twenty sixteen\nHe became the first Chinese head of Interpol and there's no election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate and extradite Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt to it escaped China\nBut as it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWell China's government has been released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife ... of September twenty fifth the day her husband arrive to try to for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that\nThe tension unfolded has come from his wife ... on September twenty fifth the day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nice

said\nWe had to go to the half of my field and based on them for all the wide and children's husband and father so that they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police well\nWhen he talks about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and it snowed hundreds of thousands of FIFA officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed among way to vice minister of public security was Julia Kong the highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China and he was trying to security czar before he was sent to prison for life in twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing them from the presidency of Interpol can lose is a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear why does this mean for ...\nWell even before this happened China's use of in our poll and amongst presidency was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China attempted to issue a red notice that's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists were yours are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with ... is a good example of how China as messy politics is spilling over into international organizations really\nInteresting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob thanks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceeding this isn't an

criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff jet standard likes that system he's in Lewis ten in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on sort of stuff we're going to be half of war taking and their belts were going to be trained together so you're walking on the line kind of like a three legged race\nStandard says the

the judge has access to the video camera\nConversation just like we are now but it's just over video screen\nBut Charles Davis and says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew a month because everybody get up and go in front of this group is either yes or no or you know you couldn't Sunni\nTo Davidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nA shortage plenty to the judge what happened and they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison\nLawyer Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned\nThat alienates the accused from those deciding their fate even before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated us\nEarned that alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my clients unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase spell amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants for NPR News I'm league games in Urbana, Illinois
