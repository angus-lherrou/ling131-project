to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an

bourbon whiskey as the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described your product rooted in the United states\nSame reasons why we have the world's greatest sources of the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show\nThough I'm show filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world was with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export markets\nAnd uh we export Kentucky bourbon dj about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact as you said\nThe larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ... from the\nStore to the sewer but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements could very well a nasty and the EU agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nAnd well we don't like you have the option is on the table this the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs you consumer and hopefully you know have people you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and\nWe don't like any of them say that we obviously is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a law that asked um [noise]\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nAh [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage to you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh uh come up as an issue yet he made an issue like at election yeah it has come up I mean\nCongressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means you can decades he will not for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah in in he he told us he understood exactly that\nYeah he knows what pardon means Kentucky he will note for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah in in he tells you understood exactly that this decision mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that I guess it's the federal law raised a federal Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirit to the United states unlike you know holy David sandwich announced they could move some production overseas we can't do that with ... and you've got to make it here in American if you want to sell you better make and Kentucky\nBeginning of next year we're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker so that we converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from my standpoint is\nBourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people bar industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for

punishment might be a Saudi has proven to have been behind us she did not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit\nShe did not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would

the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest source was the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show\nSo I'm just show filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world was with how global business is the more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon summit hundreds\nPlace to make the world's best whiskey how global business is the more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon Shabaab hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact of you said\nThe larger to sailors more than half their market maybe over ...\nBut yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a ... agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nWe don't like the options on the table this the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people you've converting some scotch do remain Berman drinkers or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and\nWe don't like any of them said in the obviously the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a law passed um [noise]\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings [noise]\n[noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this year so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue yet he made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky he will notes\nAt the meeting with the vice President Pence when

which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that I guess if the federal law raised a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which now so you can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith urban you've got to make it here in America and if you want to sell you better make things to\nBeginning a next year we're going to have a problem with exports if this has been say yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequence is one of our greatest fears is that all these gods drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking from a price standpoint is\nSuburban is higher price maybe they go back to drink and

will have substantial cost\nUh so lovely early estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial cost but it's also says the industry is quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news that analysts say that's not likely to
