the dash cam video shows McDonald walking away from officers and it shows Van Dyke getting out of his SUV and opening fire\nThe prosecution's key evidence is the dash cam video shows McDonald walking away from officers and it shows Van Dyke getting out of his SUV and opening fire six seconds later\nMcDonald was shot sixteen times defense attorney Dan Herbert spent days trying to find a Seventeen

cabinet experience as what we don't want to do and in a little partial way maybe what we do want to do because once I'm Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nReluctantly came forward\nI think the country was helped by having a public process a process where in which she could tell her story now it is an adversarial process and there was attempt to knock her story that's what happens but I felt at the end

they're selling things like the food saver it keeps food from getting moldy\nHere's the same sees the vacuum packed with my favorite two months ago oh my gosh it's just as good as the day I bought it at the supermarket and it's\nA guy selling this uh ... sometimes ... speaks plainly it's a very public radio pitch turns out and he is a public radio contributor he's been a pitch man for Thirty years a very good\nOne you know I Do so a lot of food service to people that are already having really [laughter] they'll call in and they'll say a\nTo know what I'm just gonna you know give this one of my kids and I'm going to buy the new one\nI mean when was the last time someone call up and pledged twice so how does he do it first let people know what's a good deal if they do it now he'll say you get to Rosa bags you get the canister you get the bottle diaper and you've got a hundred dollars off\nAnd then you put in one more thing that they just can't possibly not by [laughter] it's too good to

role here really I'm McCann being crushed [noise] but Miller's real secret is that he's not actually selling a vacuum pack or for food I mean he is but\nWhat is really really selling is something deeper where\nWe're working on is the common belief that it's assumed waste food everybody knows that because they've all been raised with it\nOkay so what is NPR really sure listening keeps you
