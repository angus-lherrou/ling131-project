educators and judges and social activists and soldiers\nHer odyssey from India ten now tells a defining narrative of our time and it's not just a story of tools that help us be more successful it's a rediscovery and reclaiming of contemplation in many forms and many tradition and secular sick of modern life\nIn the beginning and you couldn't ever say would the environmental leaders one called the L Word and limit the L Word was love and it's really when someone's heart hope that things really change I had\nBeen more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices even in just very secular working situations recently than I used to\nBe because people really want to repeat it turns out [laughter] and um [noise] it always does an\nSounding like a hallmark card but I have found it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it [noise]\nI'm Krista tip it and this is on being nearby Bush's co founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind into science team she's just written a new book together with rum dos walking each other home conversations on loving and dying we spoke in two thousand Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life or early life\nWell my early life [noise] I was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war I say the second world [laughter]\nSeven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war I say the second world [laughter] All right and you have to be the war and um [noise]\nThere wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning for my whole childhood and um\nHow it is I mean when they first came back I mean the idea [laughter] we were so marginalized that's to put it mildly [laughter] and um [noise]\nUh we didn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that in some way or\nWe wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully and then share it with others and so most of them were single and came back and wanted to teach\nJokes with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I\nWas I'm pregnant and married and\nUh had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back meditation we still had the model of it being monastic and so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine [laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\nSo but I was just as committed as everybody else\nTo finding a way to bring this into um\nOur lives and the west so first I started a business with my then husband John Bush and was eliminated and and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in a looming nations was integrating sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate\nBut we integrated and ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice and ... you know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean\nThe ... of contemplative practice and ... you know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and try to do it in words as you can appreciate [laughter]\nYeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where\nWhat you're making is wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the bases and [noise] and at the same time the way in which you're doing is helping everyone who's involved\nTo wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole settles into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person [noise]\nRight [noise] that is a chef that is still\nStill has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nIdeals and practicality is\nStory of\nSearch inside herself [noise]\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you [noise]\nThat you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take\n[noise] yeah [noise]\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book um search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and first of all he said when I was younger he been through some difficult times and miss\nContemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission [noise]\nBut they could decide whether it was so ... decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help\nSo I went out there and we talked and we looked around and what we identified was that people ... employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm\nAfter talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there [laughter]\nI suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasize the practices that\nThat more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they are the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny Goldman who also was in bug guy with us back all those great guy\nI'm asked him to give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and uh the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we posted the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand go lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question\nSo how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question anything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and\nWhen you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes you know really disturbing emotions arise but it needs to be taken\nTo the next kind of level of depths in order for people to begin to question right here but this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that [noise]\nI mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that is you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice politically correct us um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really\nSo intrigues me in um\nIn your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has [noise]\nYou know has is faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's something that is the tradition that has focused on that for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was what is that that is the intention right have you seen and that's just quite amazing and then\nIn the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland yeah and William James hall [noise] um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to oh yeah did you ever see David ...\nMhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to this you know David ...\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and they want something in your work they ... through and seeing that this contemplative\nImpulse\nIs that kind of human tradition as much as it yeah it's in their religious traditions I'm\nIn the center Owen cs Lewis and the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that far away from me and it's really crazy him\nSo much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nHe started true when we started the center for contempt of mind we uh we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful and sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started right and um we interviewed\nWaking up to this spiritual technology that we just need to back to our sense as almost I mean I Wonder a lot about [noise]\nYou know whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting [noise] yeah um we're all on our phones immediately were never alone and whenever you know we always are always engaged with our phones [noise] I'm I'm kind of starting to wonder like what did we used to do [noise]\nAll right did we I mean you're talking about looking at a leap but I mean did we look around and I mean I Know there was bored I don't there's no romance attached to this but somehow we\nSurvived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in\nYeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain\nYeah that is completely gone now daydreaming which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain [noise] um I don't think we do as much of that [noise]\nTeaching these students also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and and a deep relaxation and um of course they weren't\nAllowed to use their phones during the day but it did show us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know no such like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three branches fan and I saw these arm's reach out for their\nPhones and brought lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sacrilegious right [laughter]\nRight [noise] well okay so I knew denied all that beautiful work has Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is ... and um but you have written about ... it's very practical like mindfulness practices like\nSocial media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google loves that she put it in her magazine plus I'm I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices if it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just type\nOut your email either a response or an initiating email\nAnd then you stop takes three deep brass follow your brass\nIn and out in and out [noise] and in and out and then\nRead the email and you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever ... we\nNegative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever ... we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send and the first time we we did it\nThere was a week and between the classes and so a week later they came back and said how did it go and um they all said that as radical me using and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that\nI picked up the phone [laughter]\nAll right so you know I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle yeah and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activists I'm really house yeah I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation\nAnd it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nWhat what mindfulness compassion practices others help ... is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time [noise]\nHold a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because you're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it costs the mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate echoing I'm Annie and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to boats see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated we did a lot of work with lawyers\nTwo boats see interesting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated we did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and\nYeah that was I was there anything about that I Want to ask you about they're so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah you know it\nThey will lawyers worry that\nCan they be zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment it's eliminating pre judgment so that they judges are\nUnbelievably overworked they have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not have that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah\nI just read a science magazine that the present moment as we experience has about two to three seconds long\nKind of interesting great physically like what we experience as a press about why there's two yeah and also that you can that it can feel longer right which is a thing meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can do it all of the ... yeah\nI'm ... and this is on being today with what his teacher nearby Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practice\nStay with what his teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practicing\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I have to say like for myself I have um [noise]\nHad many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense where the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven I kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right\nIt can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very like biological levels and stress and all of that but it's very hard\nTo create this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it it it's our time yeah\nAnd I wonder um they weren't su base you work with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works\nYou yeah well at the center we\nWe've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered\nYou know we've had a Buddhist teacher and", "year":
