S. political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock different and good will and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm Krista tip it and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the dentist in theater in Missoula, Montana\nAnd was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nYou know as as I moved through two thousand sixteen um\nWhat started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever one\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work\nAbout repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that has suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it [noise] and that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we\nGot to this place and um\nPolitical or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we\nGot to this place\nAnd um\nYou know you you mean you say you're a liberal like your credentials are\nTo think that this phenomenon of trolls is like a\nVoice is made possible by the Internet on the other hand it's just it's a dark side of the human condition with a new canvas that being an Anna ... um [noise]\nOne of the interesting things you did you've done as you actually well he said he said I said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know\nActually called a bunch of them up a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls even the word we choose trolls right at the ... you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq than they are very ... humanizing latch yes\nUm and I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um\nOne was um\nNo one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just pulls talking to neo Nazis and talking to a terrorist people think their motivation is fundamentally good\nBy march and these crows didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or are cooler unkind um and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um and they're going through real hardships\nIn their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still [noise] um\nA number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still [noise] um\nNo one wants to be hateful okay oh what did we do with that what do we do about that because we are we're we're ... well the only thing I was just saying that this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still they were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are\nAnd really forgotten it's a ... or it could hurt you that they make you feel that way you were feeling and\nThey had the opportunity a lot of them apologize thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to ah you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly\nSo there's this dehumanization of technology that then allows us to fuel the dehumanization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah [noise]\nSo I mean part of what I think we do\nIs\nStart to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh\nI'm actually on us what I really think I'm curious do you agree with Eric as I come to think that\nUh that the left by and large uh\nIs nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity in general [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we could somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what I like let's try to do both of\n'em but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other and we all think were justified and doing it because of them\nI've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal friday say their game Trump supporters ... they're still bassist and they're so as long as ...\nMany people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal friday say their game Trump supporters ... they're still exist and they're so as long a full bacon I hate them [noise]\nBecause they're so hateful I aged out of\nIt and we blame the people for than expressing needs used as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntention to be good\nAnd assume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume\nI tried very hard to assume that you liked me in spite\nOf some of the but in spite of some of the things I Know you've read and and and there and it's written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I Want to believe the best in people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nNew you've actually called that a daily spiritual practice fats is you know I mean Eric I feel like you also had been caught and one of them are related dynamics to all of this\nWhich is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so but in a been a very particular instance so you said something I mean you said a lot of being there and if you're a pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yeah\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and if yes if I talk too much about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed saga yet but\nSomebody came through and energy and beyond ... ask\nErick Erickson what a you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse [laughter]\nIt was totally made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ...\n[laughter] you know if it was totally made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ... it was just I didn't know anybody but it a couple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and\nIt was just friends and it wasn't my remark it with someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bringing up because they think I Need to be defined by though yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's above right actually I wrote several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way\nAnd the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing pointed this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all this but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city block\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics from Washington is the be all end all everything everything subtract because none of us are in Washington\nUm you know look I think it's very ... and two points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to provincial as emerging it could be the solution right because we have to remember that before the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had\nSegregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\n... that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a lot of my opiate so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is I\nWill never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way to go first\nTo like look to the points that were making here if there was a sign that said that professes um that\nPeople can change and go\nThat is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the\nThat is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been\nAs a country in the divisiveness of racial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that\nThat didn't make sense it invites change\nIn the country and an individual's and so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing\nYou have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change in\nChina's when you see this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we've we've gotta we've got to improve we get a preview others are we going to ... and I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this is absolutely use those\nUm the thing though I Would tell you is to go full circle to wear this night began or just yeah I don't\nHim shoot motives to someone when you don't really know their motives um a lot of people believe a lot of things some people believe things that are mutually contradictory I think we all do I know I Do um but it don't him shooting motives\nTo the first or you you haven't walked in their shoes you don't know their background and we could all do a better job particularly at the local level in a PTA or or what not ... it may not be that they just want to us way to get their kid headed over your kid they may have real\nReal reasons for wanting to do these things are just getting out of the beauty motives would go a long way to helping things\nUm\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from narrow science that when people\nA sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside and\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they pick aside and\nNo one's gonna pick your side it's by definition and arguments so the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down at everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else you have to be open to being persuaded yourself\nPhase or two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else is saying [noise] um\nI don't look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives and our communities are segregated [noise] and that is increasingly ideological uh it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have these stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we're such quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day out U.S Mexican cartels [laughter]\nThere are studies that\nYou know look kids to go to racially integrated elementary schools\nGrow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh\nActivities and after school programs are actually reduce\nTheir racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then has a much more positive effect more broadly [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we um [noise]\nAs he wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility\nIs not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah [noise]\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life\nKing hair or a a proposition is that we we don't we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better\nMore integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and\nAnd Eric ... yeah you said it's not a new book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been in\nCannes there'll be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um\nWhat is the experience you have of what does shift quit shifts what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um [noise]\nThe experience myself\nBeing unexpectedly kind\nIn the face of\nPeople being cruel\nAnd seeing the difference it makes\nHim up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do [noise] um try\nBut it and then as well mhm\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like like\nI had the\nPrivilege of finding example after example I mean there are\nIn credibly powerful stories of people who\nWere you know professional hate mongers\nOr kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate\nShowed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they hadn't been raised thinking more hateful showed them kindness to say I'm aware of the power of the burden\nThat in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and a man in some cases it's too much to ask you to laugh at us and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people\nLike they are all extraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work and I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nTo ... I'm always struck um ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture\nThough what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall district but in the apple it's actually in the garden of Eden before even leave an IRS world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct relationships and communities on line and we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes a Republican conservative liberal progressive Democrats will that tried then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle\nWith the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know with a wife who has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line a and not their uh\nWe're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line a and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related ... no ... we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nUm that level of local and I don't mean to keep our been a local here there's not an additional just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook because you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian also rose area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot\nThat you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to be shared with the\n\n\nPhrase Jesus um\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "14"}
