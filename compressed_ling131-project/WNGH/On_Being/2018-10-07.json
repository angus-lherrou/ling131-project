guilt\nAnd it's not about shame it is about in her words I think she said I'm freedom from denial uh-huh it allows a liberation\nSo I think that that's really um maybe what\nWas important to me in this work you know and I didn't want to jump back\nA hundred or a hundred and fifty two hundred years uh\nI didn't want to jump back to ruin did me or San creek I wanted to say this is what it's like here and now you know in my own lifetime this is not history this is not old history it's present in my life in my child's life my daughter's life right\nI'm someone recently asked me a little bit embarrassing\nUm they pointed out how many pieces include my daughter [laughter] in them and it was like oh my gosh that's so true but you know I was a little embarrassed just because I didn't want to

something very specific but we're speaking in a moment of time of\nIncredible fracture and there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to be apologized for [laughter]\nI'm a you know it's one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it's not just the ... not only talking about history you're you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is and and how when apologies are done well I've been in assisting sitting there are scientists are studying to write\nIt just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone gave a real apology and haven't received and have it start changing things in their brain [noise]\nOh really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has since here I mean there's there's I contact and so you register that you register that anyway so you wrote in the beginning of the actually the beginning of your response whereas\nWhen offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through [noise]\nUm I listen for cracks and nickels or in the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mind you I feel from Santa\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] it seems really important deliberation this isn't just something we need to learn to do together\nAs a people\nIn that part of your citizenship yeah\nThere's the physical presence\nThe energy that is important but on a national skill I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say you know a family members that done\nPersonal apology so there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say\nYou know a family member sit down next to me and apologize [laughter] I'm at a national level there's a lot more that goes with it right [noise] um when I was writing this response\nOr I started researching a lot of other apologies around the world um national apologies\nOne of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada ...\n... people the first nations right yeah I'm\nOn the boarding school the residential schools for what happened there and taking their children and so on and that apology was read out loud it was like a verbal speech it was a lot\nOf transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality there is a very different quality to the language and pacing of that apology um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder a an elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said\nIn her opinion no things had really not really changed but she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change all you have to do is begin\nBy honoring your treaties huh\nAnd doing what you said you would do\nBut I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or at a national level\nI mean one of the things you point out is that um and this was President Obama signed this uh [noise] that it was signed on a weekend and it's not read aloud there was no ceremony\nWere no tribal leaders invited to witness at 'em right and that ceremony\nAllow there was no ceremony\nThere are no tribal leaders and I'd have to witness it I'm right and that ceremony is an important way and\nTribal culture to make something meaningful to signify that something has meaning\nI think\nIt's important in tribal culture but I think we have ceremonies all the time the White House yeah yeah right right right yeah I mean it seems like there's all kinds of ceremonies going on there at the White House [laughter] [laughter] Mm\nYears lately long soldier reading some lines from her book whereas night\nDid not desire in childhood to be a part
