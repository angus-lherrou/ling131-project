symbolize all of the proceedings four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the massacre they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep Brown's Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published in Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars and the end of the massacre when Geneva where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to you\nI started at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through a modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt I reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silence done done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found in my heart at wounded knee deadly dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota was nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas when to die\n[noise] it took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers\nYou know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them that's it\nI was in search of a different story not just\nDifferent facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate missed the point when did me was a low point\nWe had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read\nAnd it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns book came out describe what happened\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians in to the national spotlight declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair and novel in our dealings with a Caucasian that happen as this land nearby all for the following three to purchase ... for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar on ...\nWell for the following three to purchase ... for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of tune from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nThis is we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with the FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they search\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that in Seventy\nTwo you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nThe curve and was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock\nMy own personal view is that the takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who is one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\n[laughter] yes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government they wanted to be of any new fares to be for revenge from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing timber in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the ... trashed the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank Carlo chi one of Nixon's guys back then even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan [noise] and then that was another\nOr it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time this current is that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed the\nViolence who might have to be committed [noise] there'd\nBeen a number of very high profile murder of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm\nAnd people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or misdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nSeen before [noise] so what is the narrative you want Native American native peoples to hold in their minds [noise]\nI Want it once and for all destroyed sort of the narrative of Indian starting out in God's garden of the new world enter a serpent in fourteen Ninety two\nExpelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right\nDid you have that one already south right we've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by having everything stolen from us Indian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and\nI think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nBut plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of uh\nBut plenty of passion and ability to to write those frogs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws\nPlenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grid and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's a story of surplus [noise]\nThat's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really seeking out to be

reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful and it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation an election campaigns of many European right wing party in\nAustria Switzerland it totally Germany\nHungary you'll find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme\nParties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front here and there's even a
