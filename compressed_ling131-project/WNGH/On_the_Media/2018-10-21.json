examine to DNA\nAnd the hunger genome seated five five segments on Native American ancestry with very high confidence that we have a Native American ancestry and you're better\nTheir response was probably not what Warren had anticipated she\nCame out and thought she scored at first and soda the media and it's sort of the men Trump pay off the million dollar bet at all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that her you sort of DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and the left appropriate accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity Barney fights\nA political miscalculation but also a stumble into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they said oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nCan tall ... professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA\nResponse was to try not to roll our eyes\nCan tall ... professor of NATO studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise of genetics science\nThis story for us as much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims the ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe\nOr not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry we have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA\nAnd ever since talk of blood is lineage and fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture\nPeople against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking as tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but dogs allotment acts at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land a lot since you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names\nTo manage those land a lot ... you had to have a register of Indian swelled tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their ... these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment has govern what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that\nAnd by the base thrill you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I Am one thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and a rabbit hole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there\nIt's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were for us it's who is your mom who's your grandma who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the system often ... they will enroll you if you were descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nWhere you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that has her father's non native\nNow's my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to one day\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... percent rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us\nBeing away from a blood quantum standards more towards lineage will defend rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore [noise]\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood in the women and this is something ... she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ... you know\nIdentity is fundamentally a cultural issue a political issue with social issue\nThe reaction to Elizabeth Warren's announcement that she has Native American ancestry I think is a perfect example of this right identity is something that we say about ourselves but it's also something that other say about us\nYou know certainly for African Americans even though there's very much a historical and understandable desire to be able to lay claim to identities that are not just about race as calf mhm\nIt's also the case that particularly at a place like the United states in twenty eight team that's deeply polarized and becoming\nDeeply racialized no one is making find distinctions in the workplace and the housing market between forms of African ethnicity or whether or not someone is deemed to be just black or white and what those racial identity is experience as

director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unreal the study was likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nWell I I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice was that you don't encourage contact but nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of these adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background\nI think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I wanted\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like NASA's twin study which tracked the

traits that we need to find out\nI think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should

accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history is of two sets identical male twins who are born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city\nAnd the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as he had the twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north", "show_name": "On the Media",
