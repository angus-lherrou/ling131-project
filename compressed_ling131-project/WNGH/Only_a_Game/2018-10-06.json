Tyler times whose work is featured in the twenty Eighteen best American sports writing in bookstores this week welcome\nKings and then move on to the NFL I'm joined by SB Nation Tyler times whose work is featured in the twenty Eighteen best American sports writing\nIn bookstores this week welcome back and congratulations Tyler thank you and buy one of my very favorite investigative journalists you do not want her on your trail the terrific Jessica Luther Hi Jessica high you are up first this week Jessica what do we need to know\nYeah so Christie honoring although the soccer superstar from Portugal who plays prevent us in Italy is the third highest paid athlete in the world and possibly the most famous he is now also under investigation by the Las Vegas police department in regard to a two thousand nine reported sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward in a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten when all those settled with her out of court and pay a three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the reported assault again\nBut she has a new lawyer who is trying to avoid the settlement on multiple legal grounds there is a police investigation because she filed a police report ended a rape kit back in two thousand nine the day after she says he raped her\nOr NATO has denied these allegations but in their reporting Spiegel says there was an internal document between her and all of his lawyers and which are NATO and met she said no\nThere may not be a bigger athlete on this planet\nDo you see this getting any traction\nWell I think that it should be getting some traction but given that the week that we've had and also not just the week but the year you're looking at Ohio State and Jessica of course the work you've done and Baylor and cabinet I mean you wonder how you're going to keep your enthusiasm level hide it leads to be paid closer attention\nI'm going to try to be optimistic and say that this was going to get the sort of traction that it needs and it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it I Wish I were more optimistic than I Am totally what do you think\nI Would if we don't have the optimism mostly because uh we live in a system here where the powerful or as always uplifted where the powerless or not\nThis woman has every piece of that it's possible you have sponsors who are kind of backing away from all the teams who are suspending him and giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be respected and so she her pain\nYeah and you've got Nike that's got a billion dollar endorsement deal with him by the way that is one billion for one player and of course\nA e sports has also said that they're monitoring the situation very closely Jessica this is the area that you traffic in when you saw Addison Russell get forty games were major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving it's a you know I always\nIt's where major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this a needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving it's a you know I always described us as like a giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult but you know for someone like me who studies college football and sexual violence in particular it\nWasn't much but urban Meyer he got a little bit of punishment but it it's going to take a long time and a lot of work to get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so in the last few weeks one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammate greed was originally signed by the Carolina Panthers read isn't all pro level almost all world levels safety at this point and was one of the main people who kneeled next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of massage knee and also sexism and also racism and also everything bad in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David temper has said that he sides with the protests that being said\nIt doesn't feel as if the Panthers have done anything monumental by hiring a dissenter hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL\nThey've been nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the ... era are finding their way back into the league for us\nThen yeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you is that what we do here just to get my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism\nIn met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric read that collusion lawsuit but he's got currently against the NFL now goes away ...\nSays a good question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player\nI'm going back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought this up um if we want to talk about the impact on me to on sports the fact that Richard since out there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his massage any and races out of the threat that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter]\nI don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that readers back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job got one\nAnd also having skepticism that it's this long for it to happen to the entire NFC South needed so they never happened in the first place why why are we waiting until October ... was not on a preseason roster every was on the train and kept roster it took multiple mental fall and the gridiron for ... to even get proposed that he should\nTobar for this exactly every was not on a preseason roster every was not much training camp roster it took ... mental fall and the gridiron for air agreed to even get proposed that he should have a job or the general manager Marty ... strictly a football decision and that's when they start to feel duplicitous like we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I always want to point out that it has presser ... by the way I Do think yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be used in classrooms and he's being very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nA Eric and I talked about this at Lincoln during the twenty Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to have to go head first on\nShaping your message on what this is all about stay on target if you don't stay on target and they're going to shape it for you and you're going to lose so what he did to me was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filtered through the following one's white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough the lens players perform a service for the owners and the entertainment fan base they have no other rights are concerned they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful\nBut Thomas the safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract and everyone knows the dangers of football the injury risk the short window of opportunity and the fans called them selfish\nAnd he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being cut it off the field he flipped the middle finger to his own sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction wasn't to burnish Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\n[laughter] who got your Jersey money though [laughter] friends\nIf there's some way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about this story with JR Smith they came up recently in the NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and a question about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns and putting on quotes like who owns\nThe ... and when did they owe us Jessica sometimes refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah he was talking about them is owners the language of sports is very specific right\nI think the anger that comes with hearing some some of these decisions of the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right you belong to the people who pay your paychecks and that's wrong at the basis of it right\nSo the NBA says dearest with actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices either he says the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand on my leg or he says\nSo the NBA says dearest with actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices he they said the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand do my leg or he says the money is more important to my kids when she did say\nI'm just going to keep pushing and so I think it's powerful that people like Earl Thomas and GR Smith standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is\nIf there's a lady on building a field as we've seen with the Steelers off in\nThe office doesn't go the team is bad losses a crew people get fired and that's just because you wouldn't pay somebody they're worse my guess\nPhysically this American Life producers chase was falling Senator Jeff flake during the days before the recent cabinet hearing the day of the hearing and after that she has said that you have not heard elsewhere oh\nOne point she was backstage with senator during member that was straight out of Goodfellas but one of the actual cast members from good fellas strongly encourage Senator Flake
