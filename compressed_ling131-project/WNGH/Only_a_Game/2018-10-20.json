promise it'll be fun I'm joined by Michael ... of the athletic and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you both make severe thank you Karen [laughter]\nSo I don't normally follow the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits and football would have been ranked number one for psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and\nI'm all questions and no answers Sonora what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't mean to play it in high school high school football scares me a ... just because all the research shows that when your brain as younger that's when it's the most vulnerable\nAnd the thing that I thought looking at this study was just that the psycho social benefits seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nWell I I I don't know if I have an issue with high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner ... really little kids but I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community\nAnd you have the whole town behind you you know I Know from my years from cover high school football uh no just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raise it self esteem of the athletes to perform because you've got eleven guys saw it on the field as one if you played high school basketball the gym maybe empty if you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer\nThere's one if you play high school basketball the gym maybe Mt if you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself because there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across country eyes but football I can totally understand why it's viewed\nPositively by the participants that doesn't make any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been just suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football and sad that they don't really need to tell\n'em in there that yeah and I'm totally ready far and yeah yeah yeah and I'm you know Tom rainy and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were\nA little bit older but what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need to high school football flag football like with with that with the community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do [noise] Michael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution pain\nLee ... is a now offer an alternative to the essays one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have elite prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nWhich is a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WMBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness there have been assigned with an agent\nBut there is a risk to this\nOne being you're playing in the ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself from ... perspective as usa in college when you're playing against guys are on age also ... does not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will\nWhile I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA could actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players\nBy just allowing them to have the ability to hire an agent\nAnd he said the NCAA could actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players by just allowing them to have the ability to hire an agent\nTo sell their likeness and assign shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the end of all ages sort of one day waking up and deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing cool that said probably the best possible outcome from this right or at least as I see it wouldn't be that\nThe threat of elite high school players going to the G League instead of being one and done would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] I I think the only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is if\nThe alternative is a good enough one can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of which would be the first time that there is an all by and that's been able to do that\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think I have worked that Michael you promised that we could talk about the WNBA issue so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these have high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really prove that something is a little off here it it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players you know what I Do you know see where it has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players an elite that hasn't even like they don't they're not even on to not only ...\nAnd the fact that they would maybe Maureen as the better television do is really\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one they meant [laughter]\nI totally agree I I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love seeing her play and\nThen you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we we reward male athletes much more significant than we do females\nWell we I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WNBA as sickness\nReward male athletes much more significantly than we do females\n... I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WMBA is significantly lower than eight to twenty five percent\n... percent sort of ... percent [noise] so there's only a game tradition we save our most important topic for the last ... who you yeah I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am just say is\nFrom a column for the spotlight investigative team I wrote a piece recently about touchdown and big play celebrations and it was kind of a something that the NFL has been letting players do a little bit more\nI Love when guys get really creative about it I went around and and did a little digging in the patriots locker room and pulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system a how to look at a celebration and decide if it's up to snuff and I have a confession for you guys because\nWhat all the patriots players said was that you just can't celebrate when you're losing and is it actually happened during the cold got an interception a couple of weeks ago and a game and they were down by two scores\nHe was a little guy just as to why they did something\nThat just ahead on only a game and remember to follow us on Facebook and Twitter at only\nAll if you or your loved ones were affected by hurricane Michael food and water are available at multiple distribution points across south west Georgia a full list is available at ... dot G.

have stood up to the Nazis well look at athletes who stand or sit or Neal in protest but now it's time for this week's news with Charlie Pierce hey Charlie Karen\nIt's normal for us to start the segment by talking about USA Gymnastics but these are not normal times we're going to take this week's developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday as Steve Penny the organization's former president did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common don't we start to segment we both argument used to and for all the wrong reasons\nThis guy symbol is this the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy rant on sports organization right and you know lamb and a half the track him down any gallons burger and they have to bring him back ... taxes\nGrand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred\nGrand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying are hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing documentary about you\nAs does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either at this guy's trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against USA Gymnastics or to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[laughter] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was and now I never thought I Would do it again [laughter]\nRight right well she was announced last friday as USA Gymnastics new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first that\nDoes the fact that means bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right next question [laughter] the second issue to me is a bit more complicated\nIn September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker to blackout the swoosh on her Gulf shoes\nAnd as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame I might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the ... in which Mary Bono is became qualified or on USA true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you've alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what the USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you'll see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states and God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help itself\n[noise] Charlie you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose the meal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised\nBecause we're smart caring and more people to listen to us [laughter] no I mean the basic probably NFL had with the whole anthem thing was that three or four owners who were off the reservation and Jerry Jones bombing mayor down in Houston\nNo I mean the basic probably NFL had with the whole anthrax thing was they got three or four owners who were off the reservation not Jerry Jones bombing down in Houston a church singing and kill and those guys are pretty much marginalized if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches and once cooler heads prevail\nOr they realized that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this they can afford to offend one I\nReally love about this story is that they actually came up with actual data that showed that tweets made by the president didn't try fans off to football what turned fans off to football was those owners speaking out right\nAnd finally Charlie I Want to draw your attention she they can yeah ice lions because the country only has enough ice hockey players to field one team they had never played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news\nFirst of all I Want Jersey Jersey so bad [laughter] apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play against the team of firefighters\nAnd then Crosby image in and played for the gang [laughter] which at the last story on our on our segment every week is usually a funny one this isn't a funny one this is an author McKinney even said hey you guys have really put out which is pretty good considering most of them did skate before last year\nThere was a video because of course it's sponsored by a coffee company and my favorite but it's one of the Kenyan players reaches out and like pot Sidney Crosby on the face and says is a really huge [laughter]\nI've always been and you can sell hockey anywhere if you give it a chance you could sell hockey in Kenya I Hope the lions practice very hard and are in the next Olympics they will be the biggest thing there\nYou can find the sports writing a Charlie
