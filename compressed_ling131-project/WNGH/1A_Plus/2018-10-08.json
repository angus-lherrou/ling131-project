and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the rights didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John wrote investigation in quotation marks on a chair and I did want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment the evidence she or a question of whether the Senate should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court or you know ... like ... set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed than others what did you make of\nThat [noise] so this episode like so much and are highly highly polarized society um it's two completely different world is so when Democrats on both parties in Democrats any way I look at what happened to the cabinet they see a Republican Party that is ...\nCompletely different world views so when Democrats um both parties in Democrats any way to look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges a sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and ah and to the president himself and so forth so that's their view um the the Republican view is\nThat the allegation a of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the processes um I Know I was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the blazing Ford won was taken seriously was listening to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the laugh test um the the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back\nYou know that that there was some sort of rape gang going on in a in in ... says the Maryland in the Nineteen eighties and to the students that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks have girls with ... and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it [noise] so um [noise]\nSo so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of\nCollard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with Blasey Ford's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um\nMaking sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an ... a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nWell the president did also make some political have with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well let me here's part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and his unfair treatment here's a bit of the president's\nKind of characterizing washing cars a generous word what professor Ford said to the Senate\nDid he get home I don't remember I remember when I Do remember\nThe generous word what professor Ford said to the Senate\nI did he get home I don't remember how you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years I don't want I don't\nKnow [noise]\nWhat is it and I don't know\n[noise] I don't know that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nMan visiting Saturn is a man lives shattered\nPart of what the president said his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor Ford remembered was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor was the fact that she was laughed at\nDuring the assault yes she also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things that President did not cover himself the glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really lemon trouble um stopping people in restaurants and and driving a people uh from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know ... if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that ah that some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nAnd that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way that I hear you on that Mona El Yon also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh would seem to not get a whole lot of mentioned in the final analysis didn't get a lotta mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually\nRather fast moving towards hearing if you haven't heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something awful but I knew I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of\nFell by the wayside [noise] yeah I Do\nI'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the wayside\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a\nLousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are\nOutraged on Democrats sort of their their arguments a became\nOne not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about temperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nTheir argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but that he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered intern that a Democrat said said he was to ... and the Fox

of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with you know step in LA on a Johnson and motive Sharon ... let me let you jump in and response early on his comment before we could go\nEarly on I mentioned that that Republicans I suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business you're\nAt but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there is a twelve point upward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing us\nIt's swaying among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are\nReally scared about the standard that know what I mentioned right the idea that a single accusation without any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized taken out to the\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time when one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boil\nAre we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nUh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nStarted when I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics who wrote that one and for women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in three and one in three women will deal with sexual violence so uh yeah well not rape that's that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual\nSo and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against their will so\nRight over what the number yeah\nOkay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization all civilized society seek to cope with it [noise]\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because the it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilty finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing\nYears and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nFeel like this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program that I think that the show was a perfectly representative sample of the country but\nA preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said\nI don't want to hear it we've been waiting for all of human history for\nOur society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this old we will shut you down until you do\nI hear you Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics earlier and I I I don't think that the political will is there\nEspecially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better [noise]\nWell I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabinet confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in the court of law and the question raised and it was should he\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no key should uh have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that and so I think that\nUh there certainly is energy on the left but it is met\nWith equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that a ... a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled\nWas sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court by should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process overall I mean this was\nVery high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of the

as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed\nI'm so sick and tired of people talking about Kavanaugh's reputation in life being ruined that is absolutely ridiculous usually wealthy privileged white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court her life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined\nThe me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain and I'm Upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now\nThis is real for women\nWhen in Arkansas emailed so we'll have another really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some say he will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate ... gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about in her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with presidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will drag the court kind of as Irwin suggested
