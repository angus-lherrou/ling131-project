I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wages is laid down by Congress is almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\n[laughter] just doesn't go anywhere in most states in most localities and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in ... and notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not index it essentially tour real life\nNow what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nRight well MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be allowed in number that's based on looking at the\nCost of local transportation food housing and other basic needs I looked up to the city I live in the district of Columbia they said the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for fulltime work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor sets the increased ... precarious ness of work that that's also a big problem it despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nUm ... even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum\nAnd then we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages I'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we heard from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far let's hear from some of them\nAren't always had an amendment blanche to try to make a better for workers but whenever I had a dog in a way of writing a minimum wage is that right now\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job effect my full time job and uh so I Am kind of waiting by fortunately I have lots of credit card debt and the result and actually like Eighteen dollars going out at twenty four a fulltime job what probably closer to say Bye bye\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who were living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress a workers who work for big companies can't afford healthcare don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance\nTo make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nKnow you're you're exactly right and I mean you're ... or your callers I mean\nActually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states I'm a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics and just a couple of years\nAnd in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by my uh pinto PIN Tio on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic

one eight studios at WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been a very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it\nBut D.C as locals know there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting this very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue\nOh what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ticked workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um that the will of the ... to ... eliminates and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nI'm sad really than minimum wage protect workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of ...\nEdge for tipped workers um\nFederally than minimum wage protects workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents since then stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents technically if you don't make enough tips to bring that a wage up to the the um the local minimum\nYour employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at a job where people face rampant sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a a\nN E L A wage that doesn't amount to anything so people in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system um the industry launched an incredible\nCampaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nMichael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters these is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I\nI think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it wait until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say this is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those where they're supportive\nAnd I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is\nIs is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in D.C according to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen to Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are already doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together\nAnd said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage will regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips may when in wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nUh five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said we want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue on the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed to this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring\nFrom employees hundreds of whom showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees that you say you say grass\nRoots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business interests\nSo actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up or at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to enter somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do in a film Mendelssohn that chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is a he said I have heard from countless employees who tell me\nThis is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep an eye and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated\nHe said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's\nThat's indicative of where the passion was on this issue let's pull back\nFrom the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wages wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emails advocates are correct Amazon Walmart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop florist those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNow Sara I Want to talk to you about\nThe donut shop the mom and pop floors those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNotes or I Want to talk to you about income inequality and we're minimum wage fits into this we hear so much\nAbout the growing wealth gap in massive income inequality in this country we talk about the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide any real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent two percent\nIt's meaningful but in some ways it is a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men the three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bass us Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that his graders and the combined wealth of the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because Japanese as well as increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top end what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their worker pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on that information", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "03"}
