A. M. U. dot org before we move on from the weather and the climate Louis there was one more thing you want us to\n... yeah I just wanted to not to mention you know ... the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week uh talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to a tax on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of this because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate an economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's a fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure it sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I. T. I. P. C. C. set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really California is very serious about doing it\nIt's a very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to\nImpose a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment more comments on this not my column e tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point on my car to me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying [noise]\nLeary tweeted is frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contract\nShould Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nThey may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida that as a base will risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there\nYou just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake\nThe town cannot incorporate uh it's it's it's a tough one\n[noise] no it is really tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year our Todd and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em their existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience on whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just to and if you think that risking getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international needles leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nListen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going what your thoughts are on how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us one a at W.

Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories won a ass W. A. M. U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nIt seems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say\nThat the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming mid terms we all know in four weeks however it looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging a Republican and a red state actually had a a chance to buy their surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat\nTo now a surge for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously\nIn house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion in a lead or in democratic support it\nTo do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion a you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh\nNot necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college\nUh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control\nThe Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we have that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee or the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the wedge behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church slowly\nI'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on their face to face on how much intervention did the White House do in this says supplemental background check\nWill click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up there she's up for reelection you think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say it she just last night um was trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that they're trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California ... this is a court that's been a real store and then from side the White House just put forth as three nominees\nAt court here in California ... this is a court that's been a real starting in ... by the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on she's very upset about that and try and a kind of the nation is really breaking fan tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these packs\nI Do want to see if we can leave time in ... California politics before the round up is up but a few more things to DC we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly dissed miss swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee and he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're going to have lunch with a dog [laughter] you don't want to say I don't want to put you in that but I Love this guy let me give this guy\nKnow county West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris ... seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity ... at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other western ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these deep and there's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there is a sense that it almost\nThe Donald Trump came out of a a when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching his head about what does he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment and I know for for for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note that ... old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British and has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... he's Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically said hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and law does have people who signed in and so forth what do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened All right well what we know right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "12"}
