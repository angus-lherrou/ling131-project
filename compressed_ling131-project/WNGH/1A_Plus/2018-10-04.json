talking about this is actually\nOlympics the world cup one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world to Brazil was once heralded as Latin America's crown jewel but then it was hit with a one two punch of a massive\nCorruption scandal and as stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is at Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average and its current president boasts of an approval rating\nOf just three percent all of that is backdrop to Brazil's upcoming presidential elections far right populist ... he's facing off against the leftist his rival Fernando had died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including balls and arrows near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nShe's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she chief here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me uh Brian winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio ... thanks to you for being here pleasure to be here will Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honors here to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most American\nWell Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honor is here to start a let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\n... knows a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades\nNow um but despite having sat in Congress\n[noise] her so much time and he he shows are open loading for uh for the legislative body I mean he said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd\nThose messages um are resonating a lot more with people\nWhen they did it in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead and old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy he's likely to face with this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed\nLike just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last\nMilitary rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people [laughter] both world uh Brian we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... of course now has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around said drug\nDealers should be shot or threatened to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for an ... of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nWhat we know about going on and he's not a ... ...\nTony for for a Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the tea um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the ... the far left though\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty oh three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party at south now is very much hard left\nUm the candidate though is that\nUm that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow um is this anti PT vote so\nThese elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see a friend\nThat we're gonna talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we're going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're going to talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls or what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think they're more weary than the size of in terms of for going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time\nA one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important whoever gets a fifty percent of the salad votes is elected president there is a mouse\nAnd we cancelled oval because that is important whoever gets a Fifteen Percent of the salad devotes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday or we'd both for not winning more like the according to the late ... that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil a\nRegardless if they are to laugh from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely fed up\nWith politics with politicians and that there is no alternative because there is not going to be a military coup in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm ... has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers or thieves\nAt seven o'clock but don't wait until the closing minutes of this one drive to uh make your contribution make sure we hear from you know eight hundred to two to four seven eight eight or G.

T. they go back to the impeachment of Rousseff as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called she's home country the greatest country that never was meaning that Brazil\nHas had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states of Paolo Matt makes a good point Brazil was\nCelebrated as the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top now horrible recession arable corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nRocks in Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country pre best and can be great\nAnd forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build the country ah one of the major betrayal is precisely the workers are too far to the was led by a man born in poverty uh that uh\nThe major betrayal is precisely the workers bar to bar too that was led by a man born into poverty or that or a build this very successful ... own initially ethics in politics there is this sense after Brazil a\nA basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics producer of commodities had the wonderful moment poverty was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well a\nThan reality hit a ruler made a very bad choice and his successor a and a a\nLot of a shot to came and the magic would disappear\nOr what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what that show the positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that just pull ... positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil was basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money ah all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be called from that from eight to ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly what the how they plan to come from the\nShips now Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian date you recently wrote where you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in\nTwo sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion\nIf you look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring\nUm the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program I feel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when thing\nRather than voting for somebody and the consequences\nOf that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned tied the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in their system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen\nThis happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the\nPew Research center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest I'm thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and it just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn that could involve the curtail month of\nCivil civil liberties and and and other things I I and my time I'm this week\nUm I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that\nWho are talking openly about the possibility of exile and this just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military rule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "04"}
