A. M. U. dot org make it to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as the vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is fair game at high volume what they call the end of political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Eric I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laurie is saying in a way takes all ... all of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can tap into something that wasn't already there\nWell I think that's a completely fair position I mean you know the United states has had along problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation in the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was an office as an African American he very much a\nSet off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet itself has allowed this kind of material to proliferate\nRadicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior air as so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nMick how do you see it [noise] ah there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe a there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout the\nIt's only when you look at Europe a there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of post World war two consensus um you know in general threat to the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he is inhabiting it and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims we need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the\nRhetoric of hate per se um of polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people in America identify as Republican about twenty seven twenty eight percent identify as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs those noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions [laughter] we need to come up with\nA a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not\nSimply a politician he is also on some level I he should be leading the discussion in a way that is more productive than he is but he's also not the only one are you doing this um [noise]\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is\nWhat is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and get them when we we live in a vial of a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera but in general\nCrimes are going down and violence is going down so again recognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know as the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to ah it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick how much\nPower we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that word has zero power but ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those or weapons for sure and they let you all wore\nYou know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about that so I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous or it as hate filled is garbage I mean it is\nWhat what are we going to do about that so I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous or it is hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's but now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then in that policies that actually work for the benefit of of\nPeople I Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps my looked like next we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term is a media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media there will try to be a specific as we can and thanks to those of you who commented who has been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets and various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to de twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news the president much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone addressed the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nBut have permeated our society and finally elected their leader which only embolden them Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of an oval various media outlets play in this\nGreat question and I think that and there's a little bit of a historical big picture that and maybe but inform my answer here and in part of that is a reciprocal role that used to exist between the president and the press\nAnd it used to be the case that and there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other that press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nYeah they're the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out and that relationship has fractured and\nThat's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective\nUm and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that a ... especially

Heidi by Rick and Nick Gillespie a few more of your comments Fernando tweeted we are all adults at adults take responsibility for their own actions the media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question\nDrew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent and denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally\nCredit for much you can you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president\nHas denounced the violence I mean the first statement he made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred in all its forms\nThen in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on a Tuesday I think\nHe said there were good people on both sides ... I've won\nForms in the press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday I think\nShe said there were good people on both sides ... I Wonder how you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least for the statement and then makes comments that are ... there after how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility um if we have a moment to them that after answer\nI'm so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nUm but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial I'm In these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggests that he has some responsibility for something [noise]\nSo for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge um what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julie ... um and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nUm and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and\nYou know the sun CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it and then he denies association with the people right or he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie off he had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lives about me\nUm and then to accuse other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy um and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nUm he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient\nYou cannot be held accountable [noise] this is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility I'm an admitted that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective the Jennifer's in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this kind of wondering what your take on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue\nYou call all the people who looked at him supporters enablers of a demagogue him at a time when something like this happens but it's got to make it harder to have the kind of debate we need to have about ... about reforming the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term so um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first step finishing of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is about the etymology of the word who defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state\nThe second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and has voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as her really demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue into bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own gain\nSlip through the use of the word to use the word accurate though it may be is it helpful\nI think so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but it's actually in a democracy\nPolitical scientists and historians who are concerned about the health of the American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies\nCharting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies\nOf and wanting to uh\nYou know kill people or change the constitution to all of these things all of these authoritarian tendencies and which are are grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nTiny I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nAs just heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric the President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nIs time for us as Democrats\nDedicated as they are to be committed as they are\nWhich shows do you do when they go low we\nGo low we [noise]\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nThat is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "31"}
