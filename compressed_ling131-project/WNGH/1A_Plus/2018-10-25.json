A. M. U. dot org\nFactor in common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various talks authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nOne they sold the business ... business is all over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more men devaluation can you give us dissent Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worse factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of ... writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay\nTaxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed ridiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuation of you know five ten million\nThat just seemed ridiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a valuation of you know five ten million but on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um\nWhere they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go hide they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asked how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce wrote on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich is engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer\n[laughter] those are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered\nAre um trust arrangements that the IRS as in door St sometimes after being pushed by a trust in a state attorney\nI'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grants or retained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump and his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties\nThere's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorse they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of and pat invoices so Donald Trump in his siblings could start\nA kicking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinds of things aren't a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we are talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in a state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of ...\nIt sounds really push the limits the

and comments won a acts W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fritz\nQuestions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this is their job to catch the French trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS does um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the er the toxin out against\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS get pushed back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does the something I'm their stock and force I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional tax and certain things was paid when they saw evaluations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled and and and things to move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS 'em all county as the company where they had they were putting the invoices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence that they were aware of what their Trump's we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations\nThat are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those if since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with\nOn uh the the recording that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted Dade County building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne would you say ...\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been\nFifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax that would have been a business tax um and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred\nThroughout his um his life that he may be ... potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not paid\nTax on it because in America when you have you know lost his you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\n[noise] part of the story also one of the other aspects of the kinds of stands out is is how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips\nOne of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us so\nThat was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in the darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a a money he owns owed to lenders\nUm and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars bought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and I never cast them so that was an eventually determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nWonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's rain down to ... for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they've really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the Trump might have faced at the time if they had been caught\nThem how much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nWell big one is they would have had to pay taxes and all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where it you know they use these potted receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um\nThey're they're facing potential not only ... taxes but penalties in interest on the money that tote so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities 'em and other authorities could be looking at um\nWhat did this because they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n[noise] ...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing that all county they were filing false documents or with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would float to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our other listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought\nAnd freedom and Jay tweeted so you approve that Donald Trump's success did start with a loan from his father as he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth",
