A. M. U. dot org we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately uh I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we\nApplied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted and it's been a real joy to be a member because we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us more ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back I'm a short time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community has one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important for the things I Love to think about is shown is was hunted vested on\nPunted mastodon mounted messed it up and think about that long arc\nYes I I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing that you're part of a community that goes back millennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal\nWing that you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether they're intrinsically extra benefits of being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping their proper places I mean Carol talks about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\n[noise] well I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native [noise]\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it\nThey take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with some smuggling titled meant like they've lived the life of a native like somebody who's ever called them an engine or\nA our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies at the door the even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say fine not your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nNamed Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement police\nFormed opinions on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement police focus on this\nProgressive she wants to know why we both Kerry living because we're going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you would progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nWell North Dakota\nHas a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court decided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election\nSo what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who is one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPolls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed it because they said that the north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient so if you have\nID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by her supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been um talked about as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also because the the state has argued\nThe cold as well and that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about is a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter and the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would ... would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address the somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population near reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether
