U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record it hub ie Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org what can one said holy on Castro actually did while at HUD how did he\nDistinguish himself [noise] they'll thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure and hug you know for years decades um [noise]\nHad different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act\nUm that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing the problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities they've got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had equal housing opportunity\nIn their community and I'm\nVery proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we do that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing\nDean tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is Huck doing on this now\nWhile I Wish I could say I have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of 'em a career employees that are ...\nFor instance in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor\nSecretary been cardio which I completely disagree with I think they've taken into the wrong direction I'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that is affordable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals\nAh and up and down the line from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also to work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop a bull\n[laughter] you spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know that President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty Eighteen harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa that escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that's impacting\nOur farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly with China are but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producers negatively\nThat's my next secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC I Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others\nIn agriculture is you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are some of them okay with the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and agree do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here\nUh you know I think a lot of folks can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way\nIn this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by a while the president has done this\nIn their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by a while the president has done this or David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment\nWith the leadership of of uh of some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president and twenty twenty and I have to enter office with these deals\nAs a starting point [noise] we should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\n[noise] ah we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA one of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states is possible [noise]\nWe've seen some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nOf from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of taxes logistics and warehousing I'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals for perspective the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say to workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say\nYou know I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town\nHow many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost I see immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American like the rest of the world is siphoning off the best of trade and leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully\nCobble life together what do you say to those folks in terms of the future of trade here [noise] ah what I say it\nWell like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully cobble life together what do you say that those folks in terms of the future of trade here [noise] uh\nWhat I say is that number one I'm\nYou know we need to make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy [noise]\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time\nUh we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship um so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nGive me one example of one of those investments you would start working on day one\nNo I I Would start working on um a\nEssentially understanding in especially in these hard hit Midwestern communities understanding the assets of each of those communities um\nYour water the skills that we can invest in in folks who live in those communities what are the industries that may not be located there now that we can actively along
