mind\nHey Joshua how are you\nGood what did you think could be a hearing last week\nThe impact of the nation are you just said the impact on the nation that's the ACA exactly what I Would\nComment on I feel that uh I'm actually glad that the um that the hearings were made public because it allows us as a nation to weigh in on what exactly is going on in Washington with our politicians and how they're making decisions\nFor us or with regard to these things so uh I think it was very important that we all ... a chime in on what's going on your guard lists of uh our political aspirations uh I myself\nHave a they also at the alcoholism in my past I found a recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up uh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood\nI uh was able to me that was able to hide or my drinking and to justify my drinking and this is a characteristic of alcoholics they\nAre very adamant about defending their drinking and also at the same time admitting that they do not have a problem so um\nI think it's very interesting for us to see um individuals or come to terms with their past and how it affects their future and how that affects the future of all of us\nDo you think there's ... ... how do you think this will affect the confirmation battles though I mean I hear you about these other conversations I Need to be had in terms of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nOne particular clip I saw on CNN when I'm One of the senators was questioning him about er an FBI investigation\nAnd he refused to answer he fall silent he he he explained that he was hoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit he personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI\nHoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit he personally would not comment on whether or not she would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife or her response to him because when he was\nNot answering the question was staring at in very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly was she thinking when he refused to answer this question regarding your FBI investigations yeah your your for your that\nYour friend that question as Senator Durbin of Illinois capital\nAnd there's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nYou know David appreciate your calling and thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jump back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell the question or for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired and Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes but when we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court at administer equal justice under law\n[noise] well um you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party and I'm often times or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try to put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court\nAnd focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but I think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed\nHe is a successful justice well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas frankly a is today if you ask the justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they\nThis well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas frankly is today if you ask\nThe justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so and Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt last year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas in so I think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nIn another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drove the president of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law firm as think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth walk great to be with you let me start with the question that I Begin with\nFor professors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimony as we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh but how that might affect the ultimate big decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller a just a the your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh I made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and as we saw judge Kavanaugh's opening centering the political\nTalking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for anonymity you know I think that uh whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear request for anonymity from this\nTraumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to\nMake this part of a political gain gain like she came up with this decades long ... on to try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to her\nAnd her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault and\nHave not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for that\nAnd have not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nI Wonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there\nHave emailed the Democrats are showing the ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but that would require morals which they lack\nAnd Joe emailed I'm a moderate conservative as are most of my friends we've discussed the Kavanaugh hearings and Democratic senators behavior extensively if the Democrats think their behavior will go unanswered I'm afraid they're mistaken this entire process needs to be\nIt's easy to overlook just how much GB as part of your life to take just a moment to

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the ledge misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about a emails involving lower court confirmations shutdowns ... programs and the evidence tested he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho is your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience\nIs and they're not going to go way who is your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have no experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence\nI should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this for across the country\nAnd even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox\nThe Kavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press beat the suit ... tied to him what each side the opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court and its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body\nThe shock is not\nAt the partisan tones of the hearing\nThe right left battles or less gripe battles happen here too [noise]\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues on the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nFriday thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember our conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to do which is I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward\nI Wonder a professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means for just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling\nThis well after last presidential election and I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken parties and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame if the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia passed away was unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats per retaliated with this nominee\nJustice Scalia passed away was unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats\nPer retaliated um with this nominee uh and so uh I really think that in in order to make the system work better we're going to have to come up with some major overhaul and and I think the one solution\nTo kind of restore the dignity tore judicial confirmation process is it's a big change but I think it's necessary change I think we have to ask do we think Supreme Court justices should have life tenure\nIf they didn't have served forty years there wouldn't be Armageddon every time someone retires and there's a replacement if presidents had a knowledge that every two years they would get a Supreme Court nomination we would normalized this process and it would become more I'm\nSane [laughter] um and law professors have been proposing this Eighteen year term for Supreme Court justices yeah time\nYou're ... I've I've I've heard it was but that was just gonna ask you about that I've heard that suggested that if it was Eighteen years you know there are nine seats and you know every two years basically see what come open kind of like clockwork\nThat this might not be quite so much like oh we're making this decision that will look like and our children and our children's children it would still be a big deal but you know Eighteen is less than thirty or forty the question is whether or not that's politically viable", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "01"}
