A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments before we keep going Nick is in Wilmington North Carolina\nMick rights I'm In North Carolina and the GOP state super majority pushed to bill through last year to not release any body camera footage the public except for family members involved to view if I could make one law to increase mixed trust with the public this would be the one\nTo be showing wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd assess wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nI knew I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it's seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances ... what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the key to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago the grand case it basically said that when you are determining whether or not and officers engaged and they use that excessive force\nIt much basically\nTake the in the state that that is that's a state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard what would a reasonable officer had done it\nIn that situation so it is not in that ... is what is the officer feeling what is the officer saying\nWhat is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do and as a result you find very few judgments first of all you know in in civil ensuing police departments are jurors have to again how hold the standard\nAnd prosecutors before they decide to to charge an officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation\nTo charge the officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation have done so it is the Supreme Court that has set this rule for law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court said that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the keys is Graham versus Connor it's a case from Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on and officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like today was the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm to use deadly force in the new somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military were they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve they are paid for this\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon ... Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower with in the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua no I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you ... what happened that caused such a stern did it has to do with\nWith corruption inside the Chicago police department\nAbsolutely dash law I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were\nActually involved and the money the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and there for I began an operation dumped operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI used that term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately bad to\nLead these officers wanted them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file\nAnd that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist or they tried to label me as crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nOwned one vote is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer how law enforcement or my family but I've never taken an oath so I ... I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because of drugs all of us though why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\nKill honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on as police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually\nFear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of fear of becoming me\nOut of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they ... it's easier it's easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't want\nBecause they it it it's easier and easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officer didn't want to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWell let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police Kevin ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from WB easiest podcast on the McDonald's case called sixteen shots here is Kevin ...\nI Do I Do believe some about earlier certainly ears views this case\nI Want to remind everybody we answer millions of dollars every every every year\nI'm Steven Fowler I'll take a closer look\nAt how Georgia's elections are run this afternoon on all things considered from four to seven\nThis fall we're counting on the participation of everyone who listens to cover the rising cost of programs we bring you an GB if we didn't hear from you during our fall fund drive there still time to support the programs that make a difference in your life\nPlease take a moment now to make it on my contribution good a G.

O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the app store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with new Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge la Doris Cordell let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward at where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun\nHowever Galvin had these questions Calvin writes the question is what is reasonable does disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force\nThere is a drug dealer running away from the police deserve to be shot while they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions\nTouch Cordell maybe you should respond to golf and how do we suss out in a finer sense what\nReasonable mess is\nBased on us in the eye of the ...\nHow do we saw so you know minor sense what reasonable\nReasonable illness is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes\nOf the officer and what was the officers dating experiencing and often times incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it\nBut but I Do want us to get to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is ... militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color in low income communities\nThat's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth\nWith tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically\nA patrol and and take care of traffic issues\nFor why can't that come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim ... disagree with you or just by way of doing some places where the lower level of sworn in law enforcement officer does deal with things like parking enforcement in traffic enforcement things that are less likely to required to enforce\nCure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic\nForce and and they they do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely I'm not\nTo say let's pull back from this whole image we have\nOf police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely I'm not opposed to criminal criminal justice reform but look what happened\nWe we get body cameras and what what happens well we have all that there's some of them don't turn the Amazon or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order\nTickets footage out on that for example in liquid shooting so ... that's the whole lack of transparency policing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and police say we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplined history very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland left list in our inbox\nI talked to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this new electricity approach to the community I have\nHad experiences where you know we just simply\nYou know would rather have conflict with uh with I mean rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you know take away the guns for the first couple of months but bleach to buy cheap\nIt's added a community without guns make them stand up comedian to force you to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a lot better uh which serving a community\nWhere she thinks we're calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what's sky alert Rhodes Scholar rides\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality in hold people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who say that police word\nIs inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to make it home at night so I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know\nThat was such a brilliant comment because\nForcing the dialogue see when you divide\nThat left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because\nForcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving and you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge courthouse had\nCome\nOut used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors when something happens they support you when you have those relationships but when you have this occupying force\nWere you know none of the people who are very few of the people the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThis goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform were the community\nDecides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever with the community decides what's important where the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level we just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community decides nay come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "09"}
