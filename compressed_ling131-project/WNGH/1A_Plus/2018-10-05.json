Eugene I think\nOne of the things that he's worth knowing for sure was what Susan Glasser said regarding the uh the provenance of the information related to the investigation or there are other big questions that are still out there when it comes to the president's tax history we still don't have his tax returns provided\nBy him for example I was gonna say that's the biggest question I mean the reality is this was done over\nA I Believe Eighteen months what has happened since uh you know the piece was published or perhaps the research and we still do not know are there more questions than answers because many of the answers could be provided if we actually had a the tax forms which\nSarah Huckabee Sanders pretty much gave us a reason to believe earlier this week we we perhaps should not expect or the reality is that this is not an area that Trump\nI desire to be transparent about and many of his supporters don't demand that he has I think there are people who have noticed how much wealthier he has gotten since getting in um the White House and and regarding specific uh businesses of heads\nOr some of the um hotels have been rented out by international organizations perhaps wedding to curry favor with the administration um and I think there's some people who are concerned about how that could influence a policy foreign policy specifically\n[noise] well it's been four years since the fatal shooting of black teenager Lakeland McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago this week marks the end of that closely watched trial has the jury deliberate we're keeping an eye on the verdict come will keep you updated on any developments\nOh this week marks the end of that closely watched trial has the jury deliberate we're keeping an eye on the verdict to come we'll keep you updated on any developments on that before we continue with surround up a quick word\nAbout next week the black lives matter movement which they will climb McDonald cases definitely caught up in focus is on police shootings of African Americans and one of the most prominent voices in that movement will join us next week de ray McCaskill and\nHis new memoir called on the other side of freedom appeals for police reform and remind supporters of black lives matter to keep fighting for awareness of this issue\nWe'd like to know what questions you have about the black lives matter movement today or questions for ... he tried to turn his activism into elected office when he ran for mayor of Baltimore in twenty six team that was unsuccessful but what does it say about whereas a movement is and where should go\nShare your questions for activists during the cast and you can leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a what do you want to know about the black lives matter movement\nEight five five to three six one a one eight you can also use our new app won a vox pop where you can leave us a radio quality message or check in on future topics you'll find one vox pop V. O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the app store and we will share our conversation with their aim of casts and coming up next week on one a\nWhile to vote on the Senate floor has just happened were just double checking our numbers are out of what the vote total was again this is one of two votes that's involved in either getting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court or not today's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nBut next vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court\nWe heard just a few minutes ago that Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine\nWho might be a potential swing vote on this announced that she will side with her fellow Republicans on a critical past voted this cloture vote\nTo end the debate we're just double checking our numbers right now want to make sure we have the exact right so total and as soon as we have that we will bring that to you for the moment we should get to one of Susan ... a ... she is literally leaping out for sure go ahead Susan ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who was voted no show Joe Manchin that\nUndecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who was voted no so Joe Manchin the Democratic from West Virginia has voted yes\nJeff Flake has voted yes he's in college his voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the coach of it but not to necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on Kavanaugh because\nThis afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what this procedural votes me but I think it's quite significant\nUh to see the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and Lisa Murkowski no vote\nIf those positions were holed up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe ... senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in\nThe next one will you'll have debate on the floor\nOf it goes on they'll bring that debate took clothes and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm In which they will a vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window hardly anything I mean one of the things about\nThis at it as it runs anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have\nA senator from Montana uh uh the Danes whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk her down the aisles so ushered his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nUh a intrusions into the way of the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out campaigning and\nHe'd noting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed whether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been an exhaustive did not go into many corners is because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible\nYeah not one of these votes that you do want to vote you have to do in person there was no app for that so certainly his his uh his other life commitments could have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on Lisa\nSee one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I don't think that we really expected it to go any other way than being essentially a squeaker right on party lines\nAbsolutely I think everything or just leading up to this moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became a public and I think uh there's a a ... a larger idea I bet it baby Brooks tapped and\nA two today and in his New York times piece about just how part is in the judicial branch has become um we talk often about activists judges um and concern that people on the bench we're not making decisions and partially but we haven't seen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that\nI mean if I if I may Joshua one other element on this is that it was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother\nTweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly\nIncreases the chances that she will lose her seat Joe Manchin the last time there was a a a reasonable poll in West Virginia is looking at Seventy percent of West Virginia is likely to vote support the Kavanaugh nomination to the broader side in terms of the tectonics and the parties as they look at trying to take the Senate where the Democrats taking the Senate\nIs is also hedging on this that if Manchin were to be a no vote on Kavanaugh I think it it it very seriously could raise the stakes have him losing that state so there are different\nThere are different issues here one is what what is the future prospects of", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "05"}
