let me get to some of your stories in comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids at a time when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times and account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote an unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have ten and colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and\nI have been and colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist too I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent\nOn my own experience can you sure we'll just to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had um an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place um and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nRougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise and um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nI'm often to stop and I think eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time and you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what\nOther than that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends and you know kind of realizing owning experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nNo last week professor Conan A democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked\nProfessor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor record set\nIn ... in the hippocampus is the laughter fill up the fur is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus foods and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDr Ford in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear about lying and immediately react\nWell escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really like my heart cuts you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nKind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walking throwing it out you forget all the decor but that being that leaked out at you the kind of forced your\nAdrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that that's a great example yes no more you said that um\nBut that being that leaked out at you that kind of force your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment oatmeal Loren I beg your pardon Lawrence Taylor these moments that in code so intensely are there ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or do you just kind of have to deal with\nThose things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the ...\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a ... community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is\nHelp people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but as professor Conan will

Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into is\nName is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year\nThat I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't\nWhen we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like a right to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so it shaped\nLupe thanks very much for sharing your story with a smaller I did love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes\nAfter that it's been like that after an attack like that\nWow it's it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault\nA it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number as friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nUm you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social researcher reality shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that chain needs secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I you know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story\nYou know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe it belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but caring for them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist\nOr in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around and that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching\nYou know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the the embodiment\nOf that injustice and that's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from Lawrence [noise]\nI just wanted to\nSpeak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very honorable powerful reasons not to tell\nI Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job\nUm but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\n[noise] Sarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some work I could do for him if you check patients in nursing homes he took me some pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant an IUD in me this went on for almost two years [noise] Lauren let me stick with you for just a moment\nWas he had a friend of his implant and are you do in me this went on for almost two years [noise]\nLauren let me speak with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rate that [noise]\nI actually thought I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody to me how responsible for that ...\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all\nI'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a side of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe aggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get is drunk 'cause you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug anyone and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city":
