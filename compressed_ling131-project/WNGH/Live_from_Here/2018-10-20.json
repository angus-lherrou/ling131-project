allowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves\nThe forecasts was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even cause to wear a long sleeved shirt [noise]\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years

covered in lights and years of science coasters stuck to the walls to kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place it's so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and then grab while he worked\nHe said that he's been in this bar for Thirty years and that he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell thing who knows maybe it's me they smell\nEagerly place my order there's something great about eating food that makes a city famous\nIn addition to whatever natural elements are involved the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and as corny as it might sound the love the people add makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from home for so long that you started professing your love for a plate of deep fried chicken wings [noise] I have [noise]\nChris had a big hartfield laugh his kids are grown in just him and his wife down the kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking\nI don't understand what everybody's after I mean sure moving to another city might get you a little more money but when you lose from being away from your

but we refuse to lose to a team whose name isn't even a little funny it might be a different story if it was the lick any splits [noise]\nAmong the trophies was the fate of newspaper article featuring a high school football team there was a picture of Chris he was the captain in the last year they won the state\nAmong the trophies was a faded newspaper article featuring a high school football team there was a picture of Chris he was the cat in the last year they won the state championship this was a different life it's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day\nHave you ever started to tear up about a bartenders glory years only to realize it was just your eyes watering from a plate of piping hot buffalo wing [noise]\nAnd boy were they hide my lips were on fire tears were rolling down my cheeks I\nWasn't thinking clearly have you ever tried tax\nCool and in front of a bunch of locals until one of them pointed out that you were sweating from your bald spot [noise]\nI stumbled outside to get some air and the first snowflakes were starting to fall the first snow falls like a visit from your family who you're happy to see before they hang around too long and become difficult [noise]\nI looked up to the sky as a snowflake landed on my cheek\nAnd I brushed it off have you ever forgot that you would wings sauce on your fingers touched your eyes and had to run into
