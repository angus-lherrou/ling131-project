overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dementia\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime or things of that the state six to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories or creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and ask the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban\nArgued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that

frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question\nI think if a person in the advance stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia are delusional lawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder\nAnd at some point

country the plan is expected by the end of the year\nAnd the Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding\nDifferently to this an issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water also we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage ... chemicals\nAnd we don't know what that plan is going
