grabbing headlines in a tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivist their ceiling can because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications has been put on hold the majority of those applications belong to a black residents we wanted to learn more about this that we call that mark nice he he's a government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution Mike welcome to the program\nThanks for having me All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact match law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered\nAnd then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously\nOver this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office says other states have this\nKind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld their law\nAnd activists are saying that they fly disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case deal\nIt is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in\nUm if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters

having me and us we're on the air [laughter]\nI Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women with a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women\nOr as he says never on the clock though you know never while I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst than value are determined by my\nParents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling for me\nWhat is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOf the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have these wild on this side and\nYou know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex as as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nKnow what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex is as the rest of the culture but in hip hop there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that you embody whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they said you\nMaybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent [noise]\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for what ever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show\nShe's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what\nYou know so I Love kind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so in the show and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places on for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places that are lots of conversations about sex work or prostitution ... sexual exploitation but we can have all over the world so she came to India and she said\nBut he got cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite so you know I really try to vet my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified ...\nWhat is it about how you were raised in ...\nAnd dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified ...\nWhat is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American\nAnd we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and I had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter]\nYou know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of a pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like well what is it which is that you talk white you this that and I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and\nThat's authentically who I Am [noise] that Sarah Jones\nTalking about our place sell by date Sarah\nThanks so much thank you ... it's my pleasure Ira pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast
