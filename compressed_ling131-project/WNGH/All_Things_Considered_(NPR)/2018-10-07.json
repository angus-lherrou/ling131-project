S.\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there are eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage\nBut you're you're not allowing that person who was a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president's say there's many countries for denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nSo it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guaranteed that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow and figure out how to get married and I know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat James Wiley Bruce ... he was in ... to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to

Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager outlook on McDonald's\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nA violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted me\nBut according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs who wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria had felt she is a professor police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about four to something off he says versus said this something officers\nSo from my perspective it's fairly well Dr phil fan the winds of police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what Dr phil fan there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turned that we as saying that these dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent years we're looking more of them will face of police officers and meditation and we can get an investigative activity where the handling and know persons with mental illness so it's not the ... and ... no longer the\nMost frequent reasons I'm for this\nNew thing that they're premeditated by what kind of of act doors as it as it were\nThe people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out there to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn jail now the climate on in the last few years is on the police and United States when when you put the two together the propensity to violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event\nSo when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus a triggering event then you have the the cuts us off it got\nSo somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea than the steps of the Supreme Court using police officer is pushing back to demonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police also because it kind of take your anger out to be on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative of the government who is the belief else\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens and the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us [noise]\n... when we're looking at both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are at ... activities is definitely\nA training issue also so frequently a seat in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that to\nMe it's always a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment and given a certain political development that might be putting their lives in danger so this is a technical issue is\nHow you approach and the ... and how you go to the house\nWell you know the if the suspect who is armed and dangerous I mean we have Eighteen thousand police agencies\nAnd when you have a thousand police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would help us make gay the negative perception of of policing is a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nI mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable that nine officers in one year aren't killed in a line of duty as an outcome most premeditated took too because it was directed against them explicitly no democratic society should accept a nine police officers in one year in separate incidents\nWas directed against them explicitly another democratic society should fat to nine police offsets one yeah in separate incidents killed by members of the topic ... can accept\nThat as Maria have our failed she is a professor in the department of law and police
