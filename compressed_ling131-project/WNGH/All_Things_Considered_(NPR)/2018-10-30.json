Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats\nDoug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women big turned out and help to eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party or ... started Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women\nAt our jobs we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and Canada's is more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country are already in\nThe women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election\nTrust by the women's march Iraq had actually want to call\nFor this is Michelle nearly she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did tip in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nI'm ... I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with\nUm everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new with different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white folks\nWhether it's focused on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turn away from family we show what is\nWhat is it why why do\nWe know\nAnd that list of issues important black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and they wonder why we are stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and what is actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nI assure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nRelationships in the middle of it because I was in the lethal and the other we've always said something live close\nTo\nWe use\nEvery man in the world\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything or be a bird's resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being\nHeard this is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nInteresting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem they take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most\nThey don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that ah insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and ah that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black\nAlways very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWe'll just leave the scene and is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day this is the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that\nFor a new congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna\nPressley herself but no major opposition in Massachusetts district Presley is such a become the first black woman to represent her state in Congress\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interests\nThe Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the

concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over a gab over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks after the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour bus again went on a media spree asking\nFor users and explicitly tied this then to the white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ... was actively recruiting users had to do with\nTwitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nI Want to play a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed gab CEO Andrew tour bus about powers post when he said specifically the words I'm going and\nWould you start to do with like a fence or anybody that's a phrase armed going in that what you're proposing here and here's the thing he answered the bad or the beach or you want to define that is more speech

be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all yeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with\nTroll cereal harassed servers people generally opt out\nNot many people go on line to defend against these\nKinds of post that gets served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous gab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies app store is they've all cut ties with gap and yet\nGab in a tweet

servicing\nAnd use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nAre backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as\nSupporters of gap joined on it and is with

tight lipped about I did decide to speak about this and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\n[noise] yes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe
