three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe and they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word they kind of look like ... in bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock the scientists also\nWacko a better word that kind of look like ... they're stretched out reduce that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA\nIs planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt is pointing at over disappointing from the perspective of what it means a lot on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis face still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word\nWere a hundred and Fifteen billion in a while and fierce arrests are hurting offs and reporting from Brussels thank you sir oh You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for the British and European economies and for the U.S George Parker has written about this who's a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program color\nIf there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves the\nWell it could be caught ... tons of ... kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where everybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very ... don't you and indeed than you could see some very serious in ...\nPlates and each other in person left to you in very bad Dutch and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border say you would have\nA immediate you'd have to check some old goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that with quickly to huge accused of the ports coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on a seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very tail sake and damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines fairs the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly\nThere are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool\nIt will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big his\nFinger saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are no ... for the moment you can have she's running ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant from the pool so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more\nBureaucracy in red type at the borders and that without to business costs it would make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit ... sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy releasing hide she wouldn't necessarily know to me that he but I have a time person will be a poor taste and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe they the u._k. leaves without a deal\nFor for the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some ... percent of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such the scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European expos so that would be an effect on all manner of European produced\nBut wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European expose so they were the U.S effect on all manner of European produces whether it's a new one produces in France cop produces in Germany\nUm you name it they they will be affected because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shock well it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all questions why yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels said she has to sell it\nTo a very divided policy back in London and I think she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the polls have been negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my basis I'm Still despite all the negative noises around as a common sense will prevail and that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say I'm Sorry but what she had a company\nDo when it makes a mistake that recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou just like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nThe study was partnered with Hoover we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of lightness all the most extreme ... when you're most late rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to her again and the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its writer with tests\nRight there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between Wilbur and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decrease the revenues that went to two percent which we tested apologies and involves sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... and do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished uber more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm not in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability I think\nPart of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer ethics and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we've we've which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his mind it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may ... it was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or here's your letters and flowers and flowers and candy go\nTake on a whole new

[laughter]\nPeople don't always wanted to ask you this question how they do I'm curious I think the main ways changes I because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always it's awfully skip the gold whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere remorseful because people are always was like oh you're just not

today marijuana is legal throughout Canada which raises a question what happened\nIs all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada which raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S\nGiven that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and see the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to link Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use ... welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to ...\nThe minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport and be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state\nBut they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today and Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing you wrote out the storm in his home

percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this\nIs all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that sort of a ruse down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too

Wade Goodwyn NPR News\nIs defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants that case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools yesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard\nWhat kinds the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action in schools yesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race\nKelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have race it\nNo Harvard says when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences what'd you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they don't do that but what students for fair admissions has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone who's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yet and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applications as well and sort of use the personal reading to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important\nThe kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing\nWithout context what do you think of that idea\n[noise] so I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of a sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus\nWhatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to racial ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty\nBecause when we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWell tell me

apologies\nAnd we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenue by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involves sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company I'm\nIn part because you might commit to do but in the future and then the ... he didn't do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished uber more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm not in our data so [laughter] I think they\nThey they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability I think\nPart of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer is six and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of

was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we've we've which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were
