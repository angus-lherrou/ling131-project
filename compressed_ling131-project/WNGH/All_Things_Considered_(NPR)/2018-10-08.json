first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley Hey Scott Hi us a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the court will will shift the decisions will see over the next few decades potentially\nHe will certainly shift the courts are right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federalist society and the Heritage Foundation\nA list of reliable conservatives and that's something you couldn't always say about the justice he'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court\nMost famously on a string of gay rights cases but also for example in reaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to that's right [laughter] it'll be up to robbers to decide how much judicial restraint to exercise and then that will determine whether this\nShift is a gradual series of rightward steps or one big leap\nDo you think the very bitter confirmation fight we saw over the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation as a political body it\nCertainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats

default but they would provide no concrete answer\nWhere it says these types of deals worked for many governments they let them build physical projects that help them win elections and they are also clearly a source of income for corrupt politicians and their supporters but lately here in Kenya there has been public outcry\nAfrican it makes me happy with the city but Africa but I'm not and

because clearly they had no understanding of how politics works I think this president and his agenda and what he's been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been

but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily Yara of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore it really is depressed me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last two years there has kind of been\nA steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift just sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that they really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMeant terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response than like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people that would really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nKind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so they kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now [noise] I think it\nDid in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive\nShe made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now are ... are being played on pop radio and\nShe had to have a broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still had those country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure rating her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trained as the mystery of the day and I always had denied her mind for me actually exactly Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of has like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she'd just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of looted and her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nUnless you didn't say what those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark\nOn her [noise] Emily yard is an entertainment reporter for the

injection sites as Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports Trump ... officials are watching and promising crackdown\nSince earlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of a supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals\nThe creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most significant step so far and making that reality one of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell\nTwelve hundred and Seventy Philadelphians of overdoses most of them die alone in your twenties Seventy size rate per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites but I haven't done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use [noise]\nIt's a physician shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia it remains illegal\nUnder federal law and people who engage in that activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement messages from us rose inside a common and corporate or of the safe injection site non profit for them they can come and arrest me first\nRandall says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely\nAround the gold fine with the AIDS project of Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with the nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting this\nEncouraged that person to get in to treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with the nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit has already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes Kensington Maria Sanchez is still on the\nCan talk about the injection site as a tool\nOn a recent visit to Kensington the desperation was everywhere syringes and drug bags strewn across sidewalks and train platforms people nodding off in front of homes next to Delhi's leaning against our cars this is how forty two year old ray describes it we're using just his first name because he uses illegal opioids\nPain in the ground zero of zombie laying man it's it's just crazy raise wearing a pink shirt and shorts Phillies baseball cap\nHe says he'd go to the supervised injection sites because right now he uses next door starving in our way back yard or anywhere\nElse officials won't say yet when they hope to open the doors but one thing is clear they say is getting people like ray\nOff the streets and into a medical facility means defying the Trump Administration so be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise]\nIt's time now for all tech considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the weight technology these them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology that's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good an in house the queue or is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she they facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there is some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would\nA breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination as good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas [noise]\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make\nThe Web on race bias that's a harder question so even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could uses technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse\nThis um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you\nFor all tech considered comes from the three I O T providing a software platform

today because he basically goes out and recruit other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days away super fancy meals they're cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree that half of you at\nAny given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you are testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers\nWas that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde\nDo I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the food industry\nHad been\nOrganizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there and if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and\nSo there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen\nAnd they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fight to expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde and arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\nYes once this first food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde when al Salah ... acid went out bar acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these\nOut ... extremely dangerous compounds in this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation [noise]\nPart because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government\nElection [noise]\nPart because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story of a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused and even obsessive and and who stands up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference\nSo I Hope it works on all those levels\n... new book is called the poison

understanding of how politics works I think this president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans have been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do\nReal cost is going up on what people would have felt like when they were sixty three is a gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that

for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily Yara of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\n[noise] honestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because ah for the last two years there has kind of been\nA steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that they really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMeant terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people that would really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\nI think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now are ... are being played on pop radio and\nShe had to have this broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has his country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trying to ...\nStream we calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day and I always had denied her mind for me I'd read\nBack laid Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything\nKind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it I think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she'd just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she doesn't their concerts she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nUnless you didn't say what those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when it comes to me the DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her in a meet and greet line\nAnd she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark\nOn her [noise] Emily yard is an
