Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone and that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nOr you know these are this area is somewhat east where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nHere in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also have people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them\nAnd a half an hour yeah yeah I've watched it ah\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now and just

this is all things considered I also Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today\nSenators who support this NPR station from NPR News\nThis is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nToday in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so where am I mean why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's pastor around a small church and is mayor in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies end Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames the coup attempt\nTo us at the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[laughter] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nPresident ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is\nThere are good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter just to turkey will lay re raise this issue of extra donating the clerics are to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul [noise]\nWhat can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nHe was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of more\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos\nPig gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to it a new price of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a ...\nAnd so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime\nTo or valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that ... is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do as well food prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just did the shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma below capital markets and MIT analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about a soft drink companies aluminum um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas\nIt will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much\nWith overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices above the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can\nBut they can't really do that right now the hills of so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what tax\nBacking growing category alive many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make [noise]\nThe cat is alive many of the other hand categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more inflation or\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying is not as satisfying as the\nBag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\nThat with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacey Vanek\nAnd Cardiff Garcia our co host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nFor Planet Money comes from the transfer why\nA service that helps people send money internationally\nThree million people and businesses you transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nUm so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously\nNow one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nAnd parents garden ... thank you thank you turns out that the cube Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nProblem is is that there is no citizen conclusion other than the Russians face\nSo here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nProblem is is that there is no citizen conclusion other than the Russians face was ... sums of money to\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they would probably underwriters says I'm visa ...\nTo a guy like Eric told her that sounded like a challenge\nPolar works for a group called spelling cat\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works tolerant as friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese airbases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because those guys you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook\nBut remember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists\n[noise] when you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it is a bunch of Russia is random Russian guys going through and kind of fight saying at this like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis is a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person up let her photo shows are boy ...

Geoff Brumfiel NPR News Washington\nRain rain goes along\nWith you and you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season tips off next week a relatively new comer is going to be hitting the court\nNot a player issue that's right the athletic ran who is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic collide\nThat with the shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great wall Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nHey how's it going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been like Twenty years since there last basketball she liked him\nYeah so they had it for a day and night to Ninety eight and it was very short lived they had signed just one player and been Carter and yoga broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nThese elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal but it's tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also\nI think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball is really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans it's who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles for any new comer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike hat about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an all star in the end to park his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like from now you said the markets already pretty saturated is is a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media if you've got a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that meant made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the steps in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of\nGo all the stuff in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really cut immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and there's the lupus of highlights on his grandmother in court but what I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why this huge me as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand dollars and so\nThey're really winning it on their players counts as a big part of their strategy with their new is that\nThey don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages so so that's going to be a huge push for

early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since the report\nThe pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign as a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWill colonel worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't it knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes or do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulate it tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who's living every single one\nOf them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who's living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat whether it's completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grounds stale any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused often don't come\nForward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone\nTo come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nDon't want your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that it actually increase the accountability internally at these institution where\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to\nOr how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings since The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you [noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be ...\nPero is Pennsylvania's state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you [noise]\nSome of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigates the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled a critical moment in that probe\n... exceeded which was first in history [noise] to get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had real difficulty and doing its workers ... haven't gotten all the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven that document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map at our office because it was just up\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for\nHow a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referrals to Congress\nThe national or let me see a lot of uh from the water ... a year to that was very interesting\nWhen I asked you to load that was set up to the house I the worse if they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the infringement ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nAnd Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nTwenty first century variation of the shows that something that the voting shirt likely shared\nSales boss on the Watergate team was James corals who now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight in court to stop lawmakers from seeing that document meanwhile the batter all over the Watergate roadmap could soon come to an end\nThis week judge barrel how ordered the national archives to review it and directed the Justice Department to get ready for its release Carrie Johnson NPR News Washington\nAll right so for now at least the Trump Administration will be there a civil Wall Street will be there of what Congress where what are they saying about the situation\nWell there are caused by a number of members of Congress for suspending our ending arms deals to Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm and this is something that President Trump has really been pushing back on he says that ah these arms sales produced jobs for Americans many jobs for Americans\nHe announced about a year and a half ago that there were a hundred and ten ... billion dollars in New arms sales to Saudi Arabia although many analysts feel that those numbers were inflated but still it does represent jobs for American\nAnother facet of the fallout over the ... situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things matter with\nPresident Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy as like the food is out of control what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked\nThe fed is gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also [noise] so how usual is it for a president to be packing the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush\nThe president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's a monetary policy that maybe didn't call the crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members of other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing\nAnd a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself uh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nNo I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis and information using the institutions well insulated from the political when the president's attacks could be sending or I think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and\nAttacks could be sending or I think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up to the tax\nAnd others drawing him I'm so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation so I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the ... I think it could overtime chairman power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's\nOversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding as Donald tone the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome also thank you for having me on [noise]\nWe're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMad Men creator Matthew Weiner is back with a new series for Amazon called the Romanoff is it is an anthology series different casts different story and each episode but NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says the series it rarely matches the heady ambition of its creator\nEpisodes of the Romanoff that I've seen the film like a collection of creative ... aimless indie films linked by single then premise at least one person in each episode thinks they're related to the ... the last royal family to rule on Russia and that connection has seriously messed up their heads\nTaken the ... an aged ailing woman in Paris played by mark the color who's cared for by her American nephew Greg played by Aaron Eckhart and there's cars racist classes than demanding reacting predictably when a Muslim woman is sent to work as their home health\nNephew Greg played by Aaron Eckhart ... cars racist classes then demanding reacting predictably when a Muslim woman is sent to workers are home healthcare aid\nI Need a cat if I'm not terribly\nThey emailed me or references she's educated she'd be a nurse you know CPR first day she's the best care give her they have any you are by far the worst client\nHope to see whether when she was my apartment\nAnd this could claims a family connection to the Roma knobs lamenting the humble end of our once proud family line Greg is their only relative left struggling with the caustic French girl friend who just wants to know what's going to die so they can have her opulent massive apartment in Paris all themselves to my\n[noise]\nMy Haiti\nMe to be they need to be washed they claimed to me the night they keep you from going in this case on eating in restaurants so what's\nThe terrible French girlfriend doesn't want a baby nice Muslim caretaker shows up nicely American nephew likes or\nBy the middle of this nearly Ninety minute episode you can guess where the story's going which is a serious problem but that doesn't compare to how contrived things get in another episode called the royal weak\nIn this story Corey stole is a sad sack has been in therapy with his wife played by carry the Shea who wonders why he never wants to do anything with her\nI don't care what we do\nI Would do anything you want\nBut you do care because you make all the decisions what I Do it by spare time hours I work I went to a\nBusiness is both of ours okay but we both know that you're the boss and be employed you only say that because it's true Sally we try not to say people always say anything\nAccepting does kind of always blame or which causes issues in his job helping students prepare for standardized test when he confronts a not too bright kid who is fixated on getting into Harvard\nYou have to accept the reality and try to be happy with whatever you get\nYou're listening Andrew the big secret\nI just came to protest perhaps\nEventually ... character meets another woman he would very much like to spend time with during jury duty this story has an awful ending which mostly leaves you wondering why was forced to spend so much time with the Supreme Leon likeable people Matthew Weiner wrote and directed every episode of the room\nWhich mostly leaves you wondering why was forced to spend so much time with the Supreme Leon likeable people [noise]\nMatthew Weiner wrote and directed every episode of the Romanoff filming in beautiful locations across the globe there's also a cast with names like Diane Lane Christina Hendricks and Catherine ha but Weiner who may deplorable people so compelling on Mad Men and as a writer for the Sopranos\nCan't manage the same trick here\nCritics were only given three episodes in advance so it's possible the series gets better but so far the ruin us feels like a glitzy showcase for mediocre stories for the tenuous connection to each other it's\nDisappointing second act and the guy who created one of the best dramas and this\nIs all things considered from NPR News\nAnd you're listening to all things considered on G.

relatively new comer is going to be hitting the court not a player as she\nIs right the athletic ran who is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic collide\nThat with the shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great wall Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nYeah so they had it for a next Ninety eight and it was very short lived they aren't just one clear and a quarter and yoga broker for two years and so they put out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball gospel\nThe sign just one clear and Vince Carter\nAnd that deal got broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and ... they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron jeans it's who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles for any new comer yeah um you know I did a lot of research last year Nike hat about sixty eight percent of the leak wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough to bind okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with it all started to an end to mark his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball ... business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media is you've got a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that meant to be the kind of fun\nYou see the ... the more important in some ways how these players ... off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue banned in what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full to our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys at Pomona signed\nThey have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why at least huge nice as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand\nAnd the sun they have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why this huge as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself is only a couple of hundred thousand dollars and so they're really winning in on their players counts as a big part of their strategy with their news that\nThey don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for
