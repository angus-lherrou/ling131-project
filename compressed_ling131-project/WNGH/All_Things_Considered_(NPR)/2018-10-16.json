record number of algae be teaching people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we hit broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being as you'd be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\n[laughter] yeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and

make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae ... people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so and so little time\nUm but it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age and so um\n[laughter] I I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYou know this is Dan I'm I\nWas in college when HIV was really hitting\nIt was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence addressed the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research

a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents that say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about I mean\nA million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman and especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side is definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae candidates as well\nDo you know yeah I mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what ... discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with it so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nSo one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even to\nTo me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing\nOne fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure Gina in the mail you do as well to those young people that are following behind us I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana\nIt was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of us [noise]\n\n\nI'm skeptical whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue up throughout this campaign for both governor and US Senate\nDespite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae and sea level rise environmental issues are not polling nearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy\nWhat a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning has been reinforces\nTo people that without government you have nothing in in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's

get punished for lesser violations of prison rolls NPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week\nToday NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's the sound we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy metal doors shut\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison\nThere are no more heavy steel doors\nFor the women that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and different [noise]\nInside the razor wire this place cooks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don and helped us depending on what level there and that's the warden showed dom showing us around and see what we do that in the community is right now are her outside and our yard and I guess it's still a\nPrison the war is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations a prison rules\nThey're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatched with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions ... big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt and tie down and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had accomplished day my ...\nThe word and show dumb in two thousand sixteen our data found\nAnd a security issue maybe she had a copy stain my ... um\nThat's the word and shovel dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men that other Iowa prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the ... being disruptive\nNow dom tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules about a prisoner can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or squeeze rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat that's the thing gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look at how they present themselves\nNominees putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different pounds the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules so special about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance west\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runner is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat [noise]\nWonders an

work\nTrying to contribute as much institutional so I'm not a shame you know and it helped me with my own my own shame I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV a garden and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show is around\nTwo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's presidents several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice for work at this prison\nThrough the years of my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all but he wasn't\nPrepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that has been chain for months at a time in a basement oldest property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nIn their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims have even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome prison staff welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe warning has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said is you know word and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get in Ninety six cannot caused problems\nTom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old

their place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are ... sells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness whipped here they would often yellow into the night\nThis is what prison cells to do across the country you really look like for women or men\nDuty humanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack to back to one giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead to ending up in the cell block like this one goes of Shapiro NPR News\nIt was a consensus that recent events might be proving that remark prophetic\nWhen in fact actually all over the many months now I he's rounded up for religious figures economists activists including those who uh work to get the female driving ban overturned and he doesn't tolerate criticism as you say um

Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person or since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both and very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump\nTo go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first\nUh and Cushman he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle Middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared enough on there and I have no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy

where the White House was getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where do things stand today with Christian or on the crowd press\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House official who is reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent\nA but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nTo Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security shame\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nAnd a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear\nAs some of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he likes the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports that cushion or a Christian or a backed are associated of firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things considered\nAnd you're listening to G.

for health care in the midterms\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure

coverage\nMcCaskill blast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and as a requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a

Erika Franklin Fowler who directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign at out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nAnd the content and laser focused on health care that here\nIs the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when Fowler says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegardless of how Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the ability to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the ministry\nYears no matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nAt president will still be in office and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation and healthcare research organization\nWhat you're likely to see is much greater and even fears over side of the administrator ... efforts to change and then he would say undermine the CIA\nLou Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards a single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare for all\nIt makes it easier and simpler for every body with the exception of Blue Cross Blue Shield enter the medical insurance company here\nEven if they win a sweeping mid term victory Democrats won't have the
