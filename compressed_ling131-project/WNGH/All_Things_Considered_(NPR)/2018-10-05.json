Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice who we didn't last night and said\nMeant when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice who weighed in last night and said she no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs assigned to the judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings draws me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she ... she said questions there that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nWell we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week well testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation as family that he would have acted like an autonomous on I had by the way he acted\nLike an atomic time I think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course\nInterviewed for well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople weighing in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice falling forward\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing release based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by rolling at all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people are questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that\nAnd I certainly won't either but to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because he was mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night and the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's ... and ... gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\n[laughter] you know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you\nTo be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer and Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the program\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U. S. unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report to the news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah house a senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate is huge and houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing front and players if they can't find work that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and\nTrey has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from and players if they can't find workers that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has found Connecticut implications for wage\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down this low the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economist\nAt the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThis is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates said you know look beyond playmates getting too low gave a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising\nIn ... but former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they would have started to slam on the one way to get around five percent or they never would have allowed it to get the slow\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John ...
