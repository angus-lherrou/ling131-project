the oval office surrounded by reporters and cameras wet spoken stream of consciousness fashion about everything from violence in his hometown of Chicago to prison reform to the thirteenth amendment abolishing slavery to his love\nOf President Trump let's give you a taste of what Kanye West ... say something about a hundred\nAnd ...\nTalk\nSuperman is his favorite superhero it went on like that for quite a while All right NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now from the White House to make complete total sense out of all of this hey I used to hello let's start with the why why with Kanye even there today\nHe was a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump\nThey've been exchanging complements for a while it really picked up after ... war the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial and west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat are they Saturday Night live to improve on or what are the liberals improve on it if you don't look\nWest was joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown and and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis or because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are\nAnd Trump's claims that west coming out in support of him has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says\nAnd what Trump usually does at rallies and on Twitter is he will mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote\nGet it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nI think we're supposed to talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence to Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency in criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with them of West interest uh Kim car dash in West or his wife has\nAnd Jared Kushner and the White House uh and because of that focused there's some overlap with them of West interest\nUh Kim car Daschle in West or his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues she's been to the White House on two occasions and she successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for first time drug than what\nWas the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform\nAnything to talk about publicly was that a about the freedom of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago gain gangster disciples who is now in Cooper max prison starving multiple life then it said\nUh this is the case that is different from usually the case of the prison at Purdue reform advocates usually like to highlight they like to look at people who are more ... uh who have committed non violent offenses and ah who maybe got really extreme sentences\nUh but uh we really don't know what's going to come out of this and whether this\nMight just be more of a photo op for west and shop All right That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe thank you I said thank you [noise]\nNow than it is that we keep seeing here are of complete destruction but can you can you give us a more accurate scale of the damage right now\nYou know there is no talent or anything but the kinds of things they're facing there's water boil notice so you can't but you can't really\nBlew your water if you don't have power um unless you have a way to set up a fire so those kinds of problems are what are facing

doing the same sort of thing to solve other cold cases so young ... early kept the company my heritage wandered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's data base and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in the debate as a big corner that illuminate hundreds of them straight up these so it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once we moved in these databases to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS than you there's multiple like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives that are old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do that the war but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd early use those same techniques to identify and supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss these supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also use the technique for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to them it\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come in the in using these techniques to find it really like you know ... and ... people\nBut uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lifted DNA behind a wheel K really if foreign governments are going to exploited the technique to identify us to think that for their own purposes so that that many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious\nUs to do this for their own purposes so that there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect in murders of children things like that it's just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd ... says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIt comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children so Murphy\nAnd others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers at local leaders are trying to do a difference that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's had a rough\nFew years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nI have directed the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out\nThe terrible shooting wave to straighten it out or to straighten it out fast is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out the opposition the minister\nRation is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk Trump says\nThe widespread stopping and frisk getting a potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion is contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime worse and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in really\nHadn't had any keep from them and count now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nUh if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nReform as a word\nDo you ever guards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word as justice William ... who's stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt calls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns in shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more policing\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing\nIn Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like a movie and little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the best rations brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers\nMartin ...

are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nStill this was going to be American Nick hates the first time in the ... seconds for like ... ... what kind of training with they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as a cause went on for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job\nSo they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely back to her\nWhen would be the next chance you could go in and mission like this again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of like\nGosh all that preparation wouldn't do that but neither of them got hurt and they're they're back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be\nAll of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nComing up we'll take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there is a lot of information\nPeople be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem manufacturing problem who knows and then once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline is that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all up\nTrip that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they ... to come home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship\nThat after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander at the international space station thank you very much for joining us today\nI stock they also thank you [noise]\nAs a more of a danger than others but he had such a platform that he was so well connected in Washington and an outside of Saudi Arabia\nAnd he's coming from within Saudi society he knows the major players and and leaders in the Saudi royal court so it's different you know if I criticized Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if ... ah did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family\nDoes it strike you as puzzling though I mean the reports are being source to Turkish officials Turkish investigator saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting ... that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine\nCrazy that it's hard to get your head around it\nThat Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics can you imagine that this actually happened in the way the Turkish officials say it did [noise] yes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people\nHave been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown\nI think it's surprising level of indifference is almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\n[noise] ... thanks so much for having me and

colors\nHim all the process that usually takes place in the room and out of sight but as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports researchers got around that obstacle by growing human retinas cash\nGrowing a human retina requires a lot of patience and it takes to twenty seven months than a year\nYou're Eldridge should know she's a graduate student mental lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive\nThe first week of their life I take care of them every day and then after about Fifteen days I can change the media on them every\nFor the first week of their life I take care of them every day and then after about Fifteen days I can change the media on them every other day [laughter] so there's a little bit more independent\nElders boss Bob Johnston says these clusters of cells develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal org annoyed it\nReally looks an acts like a developing retina that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light colored\nJohnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an elder written saw a chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe discuss this crazy idea of could we use these human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things sell in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision in a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't sense read they don't have these red detecting cells\nAnd so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first income cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fight right hormone was involved in the development of these ... cells called comb so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added thyroid harm onto the dash during their development and we got more red green con developing and organize and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that side right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that's the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition has been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular\nSo Johnson hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular Oregon writes Steven backer of the national eye Institute says that he was like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye these studies\nThat he was like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye\nThese studies show that the similarity is quite high\nAnd Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more written the organ annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature controls the development of the retina so that we can understand better why things go wrong and disease\nAnd how to develop better treatments the new research appears in the journal science Jon Hamilton NPR News [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou're

Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than six percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people that database or white\nEach person in the debate has a big corner that illuminate hundreds of them ... so it's enough to live with your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in these databases to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS than you there's multiple satellites to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do that the war but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd early use those same techniques to identify it supposedly an anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how would not miss these supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you ... you can

can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've
