at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all those hey there hello [laughter] so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents\nUh and and against the media uh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you liked the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nReally seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role

people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nAs NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thanks

Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAnd it's considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general talents of showing us see who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise said something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is the fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still we still do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more card there are barriers more razor wire fencing crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called pasta come attached to switch prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they make clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only in a support role again and plus he come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen Seventy and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\nUm you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nThere are the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed [noise]\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others uh we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past in getting into support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot\nThese troops will be doing everything I get it from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSoviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again gentlemen showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq in right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said\nA border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's

house seats currently held by Republicans in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen\nFlorida Republican Carlos Curbelo is in one of those districts and he is betting that his independent reputation will attract Democrats and Republicans alike NPR's Kelsey Snell reports\nCarlos Curbelo isn't shy about confrontation here is this summer bashing everybody fellow Republicans who backed President Trump's hard line on immigration and Democrats who wouldn't cut a deal attempt to protect people who were brought to the country illegally as children\nThey prefer the politics the petty politics of immigration instead of the solutions for immigration\nAnd that's how could they spent most of the past two years he publicly opposed Trump and Republican leaders on major issues like immigration climate change and trade but he also largely voted to back to president in ... when it comes to health care and tax is\nNow he's running for reelection in a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nHe's running for reelection in a district that Hillary Clinton won by sixteen points and he's running on a campaign focused heavily on his reputation for bucking his party\nI don't remember ever apologizing for anything\nI've said whatever I've said is what I Believe so why would I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him win and twenty sixteen but Democrats like Maria Alina Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade seat that independent\nImages and he also taught that he's a moderate but when you see is voting records that is completely not the case I don't fortunately most voters do not do that extra step and they just hear him and they say well you know he

mentioning combining\nWe walked her how strong or trade relationships with our allies bought\nWe believe that this should be fair\nThey focus on a new bills health area of fruit and vegetable growers

Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred stop critics\nBravo to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president say his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents\nAre and and against the media uh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nHe held a campaign event where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nFocus [noise] I Can't do it she doesn't have any Indian but I Am she does and I have no\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to\nThat well you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so it will you really don't know whether this is going to change any boats or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the
