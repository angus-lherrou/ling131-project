I'm Audie Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly Senator Elizabeth Warren\nA nurse who support this NPR station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Audie Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote\nStrong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this is an attempt to quite a controversy the controversy that has dogged Warren for years\nAnd it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat moles a run for president in twenty twenty and fears of a holiday is on the story and she is in the studio now either pay [noise]\nStart with exactly ... what do those Warren released today\nShoot she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos was to Monday and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry but he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestor\n... you know in addition to this DNA Analysis Warren also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking hurt mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and sending yet from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she calls ... their DNA researcher and puts them on the line\n... segments with Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one of 'em\nPresident wants to call my mom a liar\nMore to the fact that we have a Native American ancestry you're\n... you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations and can also\nHere at least who one of members of the intended audience of that video is the president himself a lady responded to although\nHe has and you weren't really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this\nGive you a million dollars for your favorite charity\nFor trouble if you take the test so that shows you're here\n[laughter]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up to ... million dollars he ...\n[noise] [noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up to ... million dollar he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard that rate and the war and went after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned but she's on a run for president herself and twenty twenty\nI think that's a really realistic God's at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this\nIs really about what what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms and she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they have been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had has taken a calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty funny race is going to kick off pretty much just in his mid\nTerm very briefly has quieted all of those ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered question All right so that is NPR's political correspondent Asma Khalid\nThanks very much here welcome voting rights are on the ballot this year and nowhere is that

a law so some of the same groups sued Kemp again last week arguing the law violates the voting rights act\nDanielle laying with the campaign Legal Center is one of their lawyers\nThis policy doesn't
