and they went in the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams that many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey are calling for single payer

bankrupt has prompted much ringing of hands over the bleak future of the American mall but well some malls are emptying out others are bustling according to the international council of shopping centers\nOver the last five years more malls have opened and closed mark Cohen as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school\nHe told me some malls will actually benefit from all those Sears stores shutting down\nThere are AAA or super regionals as they referred to who are booming who are receiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee\nBecause if there is still doing business in in their facility they're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully talented and there are only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others that can what would they do at the space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort of okay and then there are B and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older\nIn many cases they've already lost his ears and the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the ... why can't they re imagined the space and add a food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can't manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are striving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type layout that is working for them to pay me a little bit more of a picture of what those look like\nThey're dispersed throughout the United states and they straddle urban population center and heavily populated affluent suburban community\nSo they're typically the biggest shiny is penny in the marketplace in virtually every major population centers throughout the United states there is one and in some cases two of these AAA sensors that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing\nThey're doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing a landscape in which some malls are disappearing some malls are thriving but all of them are being re imagined an ad in what ways where it would be willing to anchor store be as important as it was a generation ago people rethinking outdoor versus indoor spaces what trends are you seeing\nAll the actors store was typically a department store in the department stores genre is the most part on its way out\nBut now several things have happened first of all the parallels accessory trends have declined uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of clothes\nAnd the whole idea that an over large box will act as the draw for a mall\nIs probably outmoded as well in many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as someone like the apple store right which doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center [noise]\nDo you go shopping malls regularly\nNo play when I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and three times a week everywhere in the United states and Canada [noise]\nBut frankly um they're they're less and less attractive they offer less and less appeal and I've gravitated like millions and millions of other folks to the Internet which is I'm much more a convenience obviously and much more likely to be successful\nAt ... at Columbia Business school he was former CEO of Sears Canada just call and thanks

and a colleague of ... thank you thank you\nFor years there's been a debate about what to do with the aging headquarters of the FBI which happens to sit across the street from President Trump's Washington hotel a newly released batch of emails indicates the president influenced a federal decision to keep the FBI on the same site\nTrump's involvement and the fate of the property is being investigated by Democrats on the house oversight committee who are concerned about possible presidential conflicts of interest NPR's Peter Overby reports\nThis all has to do with the FBI and it's old dilapidated headquarters in D.C the building sits across Pennsylvania Avenue from President Trump's hotel\nThe general services administration the federal government real estate manager plan to move the FBI to bigger facilities in Washington suburbs gr zero buying a G essay official explained the financial angle to a house hearing in twenty Thirteen\nWe believe that Pennsylvania Avenue side has considered her potential for higher and better use then as a headquarters of the federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing the old FBI site but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail here is in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWere very very complex super luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people it's almost finish as more\nAnd less winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere this spring TSA administrator Emily Murphy told a house committee Trump had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild\nThe the destruction that we got came from the FBI and the FBI that directed jihad factor once requirements of gig\nThey had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild the the destruction that we got from the FBI and the FBI to direct a jihad that wants requirements that big but the emails released today suggest something else one G essay official referred to the project as quote a demolition new construction Persia presidents instructions\nAnother referred to it as quote what ... directed everyone to do Gary ... a democratic congressman from just across the Potomac in Virginia he said that redevelopment could land a competitor across the street from Trump's hotel\nA number of us thought the president had to have something to do with this personally\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the New York times that quote the president wanted to save the government money and also the FBI leadership did not want to move its headquarters Kathleen Parker is a law professor at Washington University of St Louis her specialty is governmental ethics\nProblem because Trump's intervention may well have been motivated by his personal financial concerns with his own hotel\nBut he points out the president is exempt from federal ethics laws including the ban on conflict of interest a G is a spokeswoman said the emails were taken out of context and referred to funding issues not the location\nCongressmen Elijah Cummings is the ranking Democrat on the house oversight committee if Democrats take the house next month Cummings is in line to become chairman\nAnd a phone call this afternoon coming said he'll wait for official responses from the White House and gee I say he said the White House often stone walls instead it's quite possible the oversight committee won't take up the issue again till January Peter Overby NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nHistorically white Americans have distanced themselves from many non white ancestry they might have\nNow many are claiming some because they're proud on some because they're trying to tap into benefits designed for minorities so what exactly make someone a minority as Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team tells us it's complicated\nPresident Trump has been mocking Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's assertion that she has Native American ancestry says twenty sixteen oh gosh there's\nSo as far as Massachusetts is represented by Pocahontas right this is not happy\nWith came from Fox and CNN and there were lots more in a video released this week Warren clapped\nI\nCame from Fox and CNN and there were lots more in a video released this week Warren clapped back\nI'm not enrolled in a private and only trying to determine tribal citizen\nSo she had her DNA sequence which revealed Native American ancestry or and says she took the test to prove their families tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth\nBut not everybody test for personal validation\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy was in the news recently because of Los Angeles times investigation revealed that since two thousand his brother in law William wages was awarded more than seven million dollars and no big government and other federal contracts they were designed to go to disadvantage minorities he\nDeclined to test but from family lower wages claims to be one age Cherokee\nUp in Washington insurance broker Ralph Taylor has a suit pending in the Ninth Circuit because the state denied him a minority business certification for a program designed to help minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is does the DNA test tell him what his identity as or tell us what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times Nelson said DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA tests are find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't designed them for that\nYou know this sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right out of there are also um profit making entity\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nThe courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take seriously the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to start at the counterpoint to discrimination\nBecause the lived experience of minorities can be learned by swapping cheek for speeding into a tooth\nKaren

that's true so they're worried about exciting their base in the industrial heartland\nA Trump and another problem for Republicans as the Trump kept telling his supporters there's a red wave and borders believed him and got a little complacent and we know that anger is the best motivator\nAnd we don't know who's going to be angry or white working class voters especially men that's the Trump base or college educated white women who are very angry but both sides are worried about history Republicans no the party in the White House usually loses big when the president is under fifty percent\nDemocrats know that the groups of voters Republicans depend on tend to turn out more reliably in midterms they're worried about motivating low propensity voters like Hispanics and young people\nRight NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara thank you for all the focus on how the Democratic party shifting to the left nationally if Democrats take control of the

Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIt is deep red and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIt is here deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know it's a mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nAnd a year where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator note that will other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to the to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman\nWho got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly who I Am working when I build\n... relationship on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nShe was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegate said that it stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally\nOne in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I tried to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat from McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they went in the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence and Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me when their elections and these are people from party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like the Adams but many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey are calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates ships party dynamics\nEspecially if they're the ones responsible for
