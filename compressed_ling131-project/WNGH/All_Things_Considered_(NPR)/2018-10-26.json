around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery\nSo we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\n[noise] ...\nI'm sure it is it's crazy\nWhat does the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear it today\nAre sick I get sick sick man\nJust the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and\nThere was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall and took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs\nBeautiful here yeah very

policies that eighty so you're good today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different feel bad about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ...\nDid the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent he used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and wants doesn't that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him [noise] I think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the word family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nI'm not going to say a big percentage of them in and it gets any kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you

if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\nWe've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet a tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling\nIn July

Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped him were overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go\nCritics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise] President Trump\nSays he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details\nAbout that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president

more government spending was also a Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's reports

spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate with three point five percent string quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that's historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economist expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter\nStill the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market lots of people are working in drawing paychecks\nFormer White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks aren't growing as fast as my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent it and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips in a down in restaurants more Eli Maloof is America CEO of I G the hotel group that on Holiday Inn and camped in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr set records around Labor Day an immoral David share and fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more for for trip spending more

on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news in today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number\nDespite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence and today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... who is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer rail you're starting to see some headwinds appearing for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people in businesses over time and they're already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets\nDeco also site say gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see somewhat slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what ... calls they growing
