I get it on our soldiers\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I I talked to Lisa flesh or Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child [noise]\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spend a lot of time in a synagogue and this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified what what happened and I hope that we could make some changes conscious and attack on the Jewish people but if there had been\nOn everybody in a community and recover strong and some are going to make it through\nAnd are are they thought she was with her knees to sixteen Eli they both so you know just as many generations of the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials\nA tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support for the families that\nSo what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime [noise] well I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and Lisa the the aunt\nAnd the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness and the shock as you always hear in these situations and and Lisa the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun law\nI think it's on about me definitely need to have gotten lines but we definitely don't need to have you know security guard at our school at our temple that our church as\nPermission to I mean summer is supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers ought to that but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here right\nThere you've also been getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah I think ...\nAnd ... other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life and I got the ...

people killed and yesterday's attack and during the service ... name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell ... said he that he held a special service to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my ... also find our voice you know we often shoe that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them a later age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that\nThis hatred is not the new American way cannot be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might

of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that and of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind they started here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuate the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I was running through my head tenants planes that I've come up for\nYears really is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what what I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and\nMy whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school or things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\n[laughter] I don't know whether to be happy or sad\nYou know but you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think\nNot with these days I don't know whether to be happy or sad\nYou know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's

E. S. A. in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleven people who were shot to death at a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium\nNPR's Quil Lawrence is outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community all day Quil welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nThere there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there is a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is a big Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\nSounds lovely now you also spent some time in squirrel held a neighborhood where this attack occurred what was the mood there\nYeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the community it's notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said [noise]\nI came today that\nThe weight and patience and now today I think I'm going to let them read the articles and these articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just give them a space a\nProcess that happened and what they thought they were really moved by family bin Laden Holocaust or week [noise]\nAnd people were saying that you know and a little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd to that point this is a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may have known someone who was the fact that how are people absorbing the\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I ran into Dan Franco's he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\nThey were really specials men are known for many years\nThe two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\nThey were really specials we've known for many years whenever I go to a tree of life for a wedding\n\n\nWhere\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country [noise]\nAnd now finally Quil what what is next what what are people's things next\nI felt like people were in the sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity of the community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying\nMost of these people were old enough to be grandparents the community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they say they talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence thank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there's been a senseless act of violence of ... especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified them\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue he also when other places tell us about that\nYeah I actually went over to the children's museum here and Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great when actually and uh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy\nAnd uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum\nAnd uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to family today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nThat you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening\nSays she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada so\nIt was very new to us living here for the last year to start seeing more regularly\nAt least a Hoffman was also ensure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nYou know can we haven't really talked about it yeah\nHoffman grew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties\nTo synagogue a lot of my\nHad by a bar mitzvah that tree of life I\nAttendant Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went so it was just really [noise]\nRising upsetting disappointing that that\nPeople get these boats and their head and and do it\nDevon ... runs the make shop a play and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time\nToday it's hard to be at work\nKnow that we are the helpers here and we are the ones
