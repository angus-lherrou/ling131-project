there I guess the hurricane warnings didn't uh didn't to interrupt the proceedings down there\nAnd get them from John youth or\nSomething let me ask you what was your pitch to students last night how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell first of all let them know that number one vote count 'em and you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about more than just the sport or vaguely\nStarts with all athletes that you were talking to\nYou it was after we think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform in in the right word but more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of times\nThe state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those elections that are really affect your day to day life\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there now you have been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use this clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask a fairly basic question but but what does things like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power half to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nI don't think it's so much for your infirm and our true but I Do want to hear from lawyers who are everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we are not affected by the law of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete\nOh of the land doesn't mean that our

'em with that let me ask you why why are you pursuing it sounds like similar agendas fighting for social justice but not doing it together\nAnd you know sometimes there's different ideas of how to go up to what I Would say that no matter how you decide to go about it I think all the work is that they're doing is important to work that we're doing as a coalition is important [noise] um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want if you're on the\n... the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people who tried to deny what's really going on and on the side and I think if I had a way everybody with these things where I'm at to see that there is a group of people in our country that's not fair and\nI Would be for everybody to feed him for everybody to work together and come up with solutions to try to work\nDo you support the rate of current players to take a knee during the anthem\nOf course it's different I think for me in the NFL if a peaceful protest outside of the protests that if you have to go into the war protest and during the national anthem brings attention to the issues\nBut then after you bring to the issues do you have to go out and address the issues and due to work to try to rectify\nThat ... and retired wide receiver and cofounder of the players coalition we reached him

alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations than the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct any well training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places and the rules apply to all employers regardless of size all this comes as new\nPeter shelf toner shelters deli in Brooklyn I haven't heard about it until you can call and tell he has six employees and says sexual harassment\nBeen an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says he never really had a policy or even written down Sabbath on his radar he says he'll comply bureaucratic hurdles over that we're not used to\nCertainly for the worst because of course Frank Kenya as a Rochester based human resources consultant\nHis clients are small businesses he doesn't even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with the ... point\nKenya estimates over half of the state's small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise the New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to some comedy questions including lived trainer made available during\nThe training session to answer those questions\nAnd requires feedback from employees about the training\nAnd the materials presented many small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York city you have an employee\nProcedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York city you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one day that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is in New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nAnd I want to have trading that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protective category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but had been he says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they do and the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an employer is not doing this an employee can report it this is something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are going to read about and people are going to do something about\nUnder the new laws existing employees in New York state must undergo training by October of next year ...
