D. also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages\nThere are found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling\nAnd law enforcement of trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in the package that was sent to CNN the New York office\nOr the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe counter in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is only going however it is worth repeating fit any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices\nOr else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're they're focusing an investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now well one big question is where these packages sent through the postal system\nIn an investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is were these baggage just sent through the postal system or some of them could they have been delivered by sure you're and also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents out from the bureau of alcohol um [noise]\nThey're supportive G.

Kelly\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nMegan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David chaotic so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] you get in trouble if you are a white person who works on Halloween or black or white like that was okay as long as you were a character\nAnd that of course at tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one of which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show and the hours proceeding her own show\nA tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from al ... or a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShows a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin depressed the newest co host of today show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line there just was political correctness run among um that's silly and junior as soon as it is just as ignorant and racist as the statements himself\nA NBC News German Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time that\nAnd racist as the statements himself a NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time making Kelly essays criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\n[noise] well I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host of much sharper edge Fox News host she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times the me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says that ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this source would direct knowledge of the matter says it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC\nShe displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd al ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for ah ah for the thing and she really took on a lot of fire as a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nMegan Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round here and um we do every year old who was in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface advent not advocate Halloween is Christmas at all companies in this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad\nCostume and comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well walk\nUs through some of the history as this when did we first started saying blackface and America\nWe first start seeing black face in the early Eighteen hundreds on may become central to Mr all shows on which why people would dress up like by people by talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal lipstick play caricatures caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad human disease and that allows labor to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century algae Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian Americans think of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against\nUs and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nOr the people who are caffeine caricatured ... often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles cord not wearing black because that was so much of the visual language of the ...\nTo ... back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history [noise]\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but as lawyers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white piano which is important\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up and black face and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context we always start in a store vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you've raised it or is this something we should just agree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who delivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface\nDelivering something and who's receiving it so when he's controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook ... and then that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery me to be in your conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls or whether they're good people were not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen thank you so much by Luis enough with over [laughter]\nMaria Rubio is a communications officer with the un refugee agency thank you for speaking with us\nFrom President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the U. S. currently sends hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neil is a senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and should have known you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument is so actually\nUnited States over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations that goes into all\nStates over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThat goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods so if I hear\nYou write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground in many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs from Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries were and we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day that we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places\nTo make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and bringing of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now ...\nAnd wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now ... national in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\n[laughter] so if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nI Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable\nIn Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people chanted O'Neill of the council on Foreign Relations so much my pleasure [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turned up this ancient part of the brain may have been under estimate it a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nDoesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it is that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico do some boxes they found some surprising connections about twenty per se\nThey used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of did it functions Scott America post doc and doesn't box lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of his day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effort less\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some bucks as the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel and most people thought but these results for re more exciting and clear than I could've ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists the neurologist had been missing for a long time\nAnd do some knocked says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nWe have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking ... editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results his Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia ... Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Syria but on the on talking to the thoughts of the brain upstairs involved and cognition means that served by them is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it's smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what Sarah but um does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its country\nSarah but um does to motor control it does to cook mission and emotion as well\nMom and says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder or have a link to cerebellum\nAnd mom and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR News\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nAnd you're listening to all things considered ... where in Eighteen station radio network of Georgia Public broadcasting including Ninety seven point seven in Rome I'm Cindy hill he day stretch Armstrong and Bobby ...
