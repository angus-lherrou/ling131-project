Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is undercutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president's so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut this is only a kind of me also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade limb to limb and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on falls it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nCongress I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't ...\nThe stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe Congress I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't pay well partly counteract that\nTrump has so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blimps their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and little tight\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorbs the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.

on on on these days and days person is on the ... list from the cart\nLoud one was confused why couldn't he bought this dream ticket he started looking into this situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loved one had landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nDream of one thing that comes along with them ... list are unprecedented lists that uh you're fired from the high end consumption which means that you can take a speed train you can fly\nChina started the black with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system\nTake a speed train you can fly China started the blacklist about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them\nBut then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapse suddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back\nAnd the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank she found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the

trustworthy bloodline says these billboards are all over town\nShe says whenever you went out whenever he sees a billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that she saw the face of someone he knew\nOr on him to divulge with all of our own garden this or ... whatever is necessary industry as I did get a no up their\nLoved one started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist he started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to she started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around so much on\nHer because actually the the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant and people will say why are you here being happy widely used to have time to be happy [laughter] why do you not go out and make money to pay back\nYour loan so far loud one says you've paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so still about one point two million to go but even when loud one does\nAbout three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed\nSo still about one point two million to go but even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked lawyers and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt well it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen\nWe reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment\nLoud one says she will keep paying off is that she has to believe

Stephen Fowler is covering the election for its high Steven Hi Sandy\nEven there are a lot of different things that are on people's ballot depending on where they live at these questions are there for everyone and why is that important well five of the questions amend the state constitution and too\nYou're on people's ballots depending on where they live at these questions are there for everyone and why is that important well five of the questions amend the state constitution and two of them are referendum that these were passed by the state legislature by a two thirds majority\nAnd in addition to conversations like you and I are having the secretary of state's office has a summary of each of the questions to boil down all the legal language\nAnd it's on your sample ballot at your counties elections website as well\nIt's also important to note there are special questions for different city and county elections you need to check out as well like a potential cap on property taxes in Atlanta or earlier Sunday alcohol sales in many places across the state which is a constitutional and then that has been getting the nice attention\nWell I'm going to say all of them should be getting some scrutiny because they are all on the ballot but the most bonded measure as amendment for commonly known as Maher sees locked\nDoors is one of several states that could adopt this measure the put several rights for alleged victims into the state constitution like or the right to be notified when hearings or other legal matters happened\nAs being bankrolled by software billionaire named Henry Nicholas basically much of this is already state law proponents of the measure hope putting it in the constitution won't give it more weight\nA boat Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the candidates for governor support the measure\nBut there are questions opponents say it could violate due process for those accused of a crime\nBy giving equal weight to an accuser before someone is even found guilty of courts in the legal process there's also and then that would create a special business course how could this change the way that complex cases are handled the the biggest thing here Cindy is that there would be a separate avenue just for companies to hash\nOut those business disputes\nThe thought here is that a judge in a business court but only deal with business cases and they would have more expertise than a judge who does a little bit of it is a little bit of that but the main opposition comes from how\nThese judges would fill the bench this amendment allows the governor to appoint judges who were then confirmed by state judiciary committee's other judges around the state our elected and on the subject of business the Fifth Amendment on the ballot would affect counties that have more than one school district think Atlanta public schools in Fulton County schools\nThose places would remove requirement that all the school districts have to sign off on an education sales tax said simplify the process a little even now say to that deal with George's natural resources in taxes correct amendment one took about ten years to get to this point if passed the state would take\nThey've now said to him and that that deal with George's natural resources in taxes correct amendment one took about ten years to get to this point if passed the state but take eighty percent of existing sales taxes on sporting goods and other outdoors type goods to create the Georgia outdoor stewardship trust fund\nEstimates say it would take about two hundred million dollars and the next decade to either buy things like public land or take care of things we have already\nSet up by a fishing pole or a surfboard or something like that some of the money that would go to conservation efforts basically but like all spending things there's a catch if the economy starts doing terribly there's a provision that would move that money back to the general pot [noise]\nThe other amendment we haven't touched on is a timber tax or more specifically how the timber tax works are friends of the Atlanta Journal constitution provide a little history lesson in their explainer large timberland owners get big tax breaks in the states and the similar amount to those local governments missing out on the tax\nThis amendment would put the state in charge of assessing taxes on these timberland owners while also trying to lower the tax burden the official summary doesn't make it much clearer\nQuote encourages the conservation sustainability and longevity of Georgia's working for us to tax\nSub classification and grants yeah that's a pretty broad last least even what are the two state wide referendum about well these two are a little simpler referendum a would give a homestead exemption for people living in a place that straddles multiple counties again like the city of Atlanta\nReferendum be tweaks tax code and clarifies existing law to make sure homes for the mentally disabled are still allowed to take advice Lauren tax exemption\nTV Steven Tyler thanks so much for joining me and explaining all of this thank you and you can read more about the statewide

time in which differences on policy issues did lead to violent civil protests that didn't lead to blood in the streets so I Do I Believe this is possible it's part of my own life experience and\nThe concept of a civil war is seeping out into the open especially on the right the civil war and America's horizon reads the headline in last month's the American conservative and on town hall dot com a

conflicts are up did you see a a drop in the capacity to deal with one another and and to focus on one of the prevailing identity the sense that you can't necessarily interact or all work together with someone from a different identity group\nThat that's something we see here uh you mean the U.S as we look at some of the partisan political divisions\nThe way to prevent disagreements from becoming violence according to experts in civil conflict is to be more open to those with whom we disagree\nThe biggest challenge that many people have in in their own lives is really taking the first step to not when you disagree with someone to listen first that's job and again I think as you look at the U.S today we're entering a period of of conflict but you know even if conflict is inevitable violence is not\nBoth the way we talk about politics and the way we listen about politics these experts say have a profound influence on the direction of this country to Mac NPR News\nYou're listening
