about you but I have not even bother to buying a ticket because I'm a total pessimistic about the lottery I don't even try any more men I'm actually risk averse to leave any like does anyone think they're really gonna win mathematically speaking the odds are ridiculously against us\nHow ever our next story is about a guy who flipped those odds over and over again here's Alex called American from our planet money podcast it's Nineteen Ninety two in Virginia the pot was twenty seven million dollars big for the time\nAnd when winter comes forward it seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets\nTo guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system like Ken ... visit him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of better over seven million dollars to buy all the share of the largest seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plan was defined Monday I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific ... hello hello Hi this is defined Mondo\nYeah he says that Virginia thing it took decades to get to that level the story starts in Romania in the late Nineteen fifty ... has a young family and he wants to get out of the country\nI mean you know I live in a factory I'm sixty ... among which was good shoes\nHe decides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural math ... so he goes to the library and he starts reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery there that if he buys certain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so we pools his money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe won Seventy two thousand shutting down to the lake which was about a TV show\nOr a big score that was on your first try\nHe takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he raises more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know I Want twelve times eventually Australia passes a law that block\nAustralian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while you know tribute\nI Want will\nEventually Australia passes a law that block them from buying up all the tickets so he sets a sites on the big prizes in America he decides Virginia is the place at the time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets\nHe waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split pot\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets so isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find the winning tickets and then turning them all in so\nHis secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nArgued that would we want ... chicken bride [noise] ... ... to ... hours and ...\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and there are just too many combinations so the great lottery play of Nineteen Ninety two will likely state the last great lottery playing out go mark NPR no\nSupport from Planet Money comes from

biggest fan bases ethic is his face off\nWhat's crazy also these two teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen and guess who pitched game to that game for the Boston Red Sox who ... even without Babe Ruth you might've heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees that's how our batteries\nThese this goalie okay with them yeah\nAnd they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's this historic match up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball teams somehow they missed each other when they've all been in the world series it was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how does this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case the Dodgers got torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games but it went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the theme in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire to get back\nAnd win the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they wouldn't got many Machado I mean this is Ben they're often said or eat or he's at shortstop they lost Corey seeker during the season so now they have a child and then\nReally is there a ... I Know it's not Clinton ... its Walker bealer so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest they one of the best picture that we've seen in the national ... they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had\nThat Boston is that a lot of reasons to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this team is arguably one of the best\nRegular season we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want a hundred and eight games yeah you get an award\nBut without a doubt they were the best thing the baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want to make games yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nAnd you don't get anything oh you get if you want a hundred and ... yeah they were in the ... they are so good out of it as well you know and the post season the vaccines are always when you got to go out and play\n[noise] All right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win\nDaughters ... and that's going to shock a lot of people because of the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there's nobody better or to love about the postseason transcend all of that\nTalent pitching hitting I don't care for all the numbers out yeah is redemption it's and it's it's fire the Dodgers have because they live in game seven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory this year All right that was ESPN\nBaseball analyst Jessica Mendoza she'll be on sports center covering the world series thanks so much Jessica thank you out there [noise]\nThey do but if they banned them\nShe says I'll cradle and for a while as we walk because he gets tired but I don't care or carry him as far as we have to go to care of and keep spending and Justin safe does it in a sense of family they lost a few days ago it brings out locals with donations it's the only way\nShe could imagine making it to the U. S. for NPR News I'm James Frederick in weeks left Mexico\nAll right now an update on the migrant children who were separated from their families at the U. S. Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union the ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court\nThe American civil liberties union the ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nFirst say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in touch see\nThat's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them but what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me\nLook my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nThey very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law they would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but well we're also seeing\nUnder standard child welfare law state law they would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nThe wires allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids were not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThese has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government had no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us a phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the fire we will find the

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish\nPresident Trump is campaigning hard with just two weeks to go until the mid term elections and he's keeping the fact checkers busy we're going to take a look now at some of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico in hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly people\nComing up through the southern border\nFrom the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that\nGroup ah there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nIllegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first lost his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear on his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n\n[noise]\nThird on that list with a tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream or ...\n[noise]\nThird on that list with a tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax that they passed in twenty Seventeen but we hadn't been hearing too much about what's going on\nOn the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nTomorrow morning from five until nine on listener supported gp be\nSupport for G.

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\nManner pres considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of an why use Brennan\nCenters voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nCountry has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty times\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations close polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot that will count\nWe're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nHis role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative effort [noise] um we want\nVoted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls the problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nMany of the strictest laws\nHave been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturn now or it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet\nI I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n[noise] you know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you [noise] there are few subjects that can divide families more quickly than politics can mother against father father against sun sun against daughter will you get the idea\nAnd then there's this kitty wells relatives of Adam ... published an op ed against him saying the Republican is not fit to be governor of Nevada\nThis is just the latest example of a politician family feud going\nIt against him saying the Republican is not fit to be governor of Nevada this is just the latest example of politicians family feud going public Laurel white of Wisconsin Public radio reports on some others\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has endorsed the Republican running to succeed him in Wisconsin's first congressional district but for some that endorsement isn't the one that's meant the most in this race it's this one\nMy name is James ... having a cop who were twenty three years people want to be represented by someone who's more so that's one of many reasons why I voted for Brian spell for Congress\nThe abs seems pretty typical as political attack ads go and it is except that the person speaking is the brother of style democratic opponent Randy Bryce Joseph ... is a democratic strategist in Wisconsin He says the ad reflects a political attitude in the state and across the country that's become more nasty and polarizing\nWe heard about it it's been said arbitrary figure out what's happening with strong with politics as literally as a family member to experiment number that I went wow you're that is really just started we had to close public\nPeggy says this kind of ad is bad for candidates and voters because it makes elections less about issues and more about candidates personal lives and Randy Bryce isn't alone in facing this sort of attack in Arizona Republican Congressman Paul ghosts are six siblings filmed an ad against him this election year as well\nGrace cos are Jones goes and goes or Jennifer gold star pogo SARS my brother my brother and I endorsed Dr real Dr ... whole heartedly\nGhosts are responded to that ad by calling his siblings disgruntled Hillary supporters who put political ideology before family he said Stalin would be proud\nThese ads may be the most public display of family feuds over politics but fights like them are happening more and more across America\nEven when a sibling isn't running for Congress Dr Keith ... professor of behavioral economics at UCLA and coauthor of politics gets personal effects of political partisanship an advertising on family ties\nWe don't actually have very good survey data on how often it is that families have kind of like deep partisan splits within than we do know that it's becoming more common\nGenerally to study last year they use cell phone data to compare the length of Thanksgiving dinners after twenty six teens bruising presidential election to the length of dinners the previous year\nFamilies that voted differently in swing states\nData to compare the length of Thanksgiving dinners after twenty six teens bruising presidential election to the length of dinners the previous year\nFamilies that voted differently in swing states actually solve reduction over an hour and a half like shorter Thanksgiving dinner and twenty sixteen than in twenty Fifteen\n... says the more political ads that ran the shorter the family dinners got and perhaps unsurprisingly the people who seem most hurt by these conflicts aren't the partisans on either side it's the family members caught in the middle\nIn Arizona eighty five year old Bernadette ghosts are told the New York times that she was shocked and crushed by the things six of her children set about their brother in the attack ad in Wisconsin the brace brothers mother Nancy released a letter asking the pack behind the ads to take it off the air\nShe says they need to consider a mother's pain at seeing her son's pitted against each other all for political gain\nFor NPR News I'm Laurel light in that [noise]\nUm the ... the Turks have or we believe audiotapes um there's still the question where the body is so I talked to to Bruce ... of the Brookings Institution um and here's what he had to say about the the Turkish thinking\nI think her to want to enjoy watching NBS twist and the wind and I think he's probably going to play that game for some time to come\nIn the meantime you mentioned the Saudis wanting to move on quickly how have they responded to all that well today was the beginning of this big business conference or in the capital Riyadh the so called Davos in the desert\nAnd Mohammed bin some on the crown prince NBS a backed out but then he made a surprise cameo appearance in and got a standing ovation so this is clearly the Saudi playbook to a\nTo a business as usual let's find a way out of this and move on the big question of course will be will Mohammed bin some on remain as the crown prince his father is in his eighties and ailing a so far NBS is still in\nOf course will be will Mohammed bin some on remain as the crown prince his father is in his eighties and ailing a so far NBS is still in line to succeed him That's NPR's Greg Myre thank you for your reporting thank you\nAnd leaving hearing the killing of Saudi journalist ... has sparked international outrage that people right here in the U.S are also talking about the incentive and how President Trump has been handling it\nNorth Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports on how it's playing out among voters and us media outlets just two weeks before the mid term elections\nCarol morality and her friend Boston Neary work in publishing and live near Burlington, Vermont both say they're definitely voting next month both described themselves as independents when I ask if they are paying attention to the ... case they nod their heads\nWe actually were discussing it in a car on the way down here\nWe meet on the street in Virginia Vermont where the tour shopping and leave peeping ... says she's troubled by President Trump's focus on money and an arms deal with the Saudis rather than seeking justice for a slain journalist\nIf he was murdered [noise] um I don't think that his biggest concern should be clear cut off and make an educated decision whether human\nMyriad agreed says she thinks Trump's tone just isn't right\nI I think that sums it up more\nTransparent moral leadership of either\nThis narrative questioning Trump's moral compass on the show she case has played over and over and media that tends to be critical of the president here's Joe Scarborough on MSNBC\nAnd then he was killed and he was dismembered Donald Trump's for spots hey we get a lot of money from their or Trump's values are not American values those are Donald Trump's values\nBut in conservative tilting media friendly to President Trump this sounds very different the Washington Post last week described a whisper campaign by conservative commentators and activists ended discredited in the show ... some suggesting possible ties to Muslim radicals\nThis narrative has been taken up by Republican politicians including Corey Stewart a candidate for US Senate in Virginia who spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper that's for sure\nWhen he was ... he was not a good guy himself\nWhat does that mean exactly not not a good guy himself\nWell either so I mean there's a lot of stuff out there uh\nOne boy leading this attack on the show gene is Rush Limbaugh less than three weeks after the Saudi journalist in Washington Post columnist was brutally killed Limbaugh used his influential radio show on friday to describe the show G. as suspicious\nFor the Saudi journalist in Washington Post columnist was brutally killed\nLimbaugh used his influential radio show on friday to describe this show G. as suspicious a man unworthy the president's concerns store there's no whisper about this cabinet whispering anything when I talk about this I'm ... from the stops on Saturday the Saudis acknowledged ... died in their embassy\nBut many conservative outlets have simply downplayed his death like President Trump they've focused attention instead on that caravan of migrants moving north through Central America and Mexico Peter ... is the host of the program Fox and friends it will be time to deploy the military I Believe so because we haven't changed our immigration\nPolicy is this issue immigration did seem far more significant to many of the voters we spoke to they ranked protecting America's borders as a higher priority for Trump the show gee case\nMike downs is a retired state trooper in Westport New York's\nA Democrat who says he'll be voting Republican this year Trump is on the right track trying to correct certain things like for instance the immigration you know we watch it on television you know the I feel sorry for these people but we can't police the whole world\nWith voting already underway and parts of the country are interviews didn't find the Trump's handling of the show gee killing appeared to be changing many minds about him or the mid term elections those who favor the president seemed on troubled by the case or weren't paying it much mind\nVoters hostile to Trump said the story just reinforces what they felt before anger and outrage Brian Mann NPR News\nYou are listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn Russia it's become dangerous to protest in public Russians want to complain about ... government are rarely granted permission if they protest any way they often end up in jail but there is another way to protest in public it's called the solitary picket NPR's Lucian Kim reports\nThis morning rush hour traffic

husband took out a mortgage and soldier grandmother's house I don't know three and a half million rubles in debt more than fifty thousand dollars she says uh one person picking the only way of getting our message to the government\nThought that was the same thing you know we can't make a mass protests like in America\nWhere people they're unhappy about with posters and point is that everybody feed them\nThat's not allowed here let me ask permission for everything [noise]\nThey won't give it to you\nJust like in the U.S Russian constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly but since the Russian Revolution a century ago public protests has largely been stifled there had been some exceptions fifty years ago eight loan demonstrators went out on Red Square to protest the Soviet union's invasion of Czechoslovakia\nThey faced various forms of punishment somewhere locked up in psychiatric hospitals decades later the communist system was brought down by hundreds of thousands of people peacefully taken to the streets in Prague and Moscow\n[noise]\nBut after ... ... was first elected president thousands of room for public protest got smaller and smaller and\nAccused you wish knew she was she was but he is the government is scared of St activism and then they turn nip any small protests in the bud\nSo they don't unite can turn into a mass demonstration lift but my real as a veteran human rights activists twist organized dozens of protests says the authorities are breaking the law by banning rally you should contribute to pursue those we most you\nIf there's a conflict between the government and an individual then the individual is always guilty you must clearly part of the Soviet legacy and under boot and there'll be at times are starting to return\nBack at a solitary

S. for NPR News I'm James Frederick ... Mexico\nRight now and update on migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should say that the vast majority of these children\nReunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nFirst say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so I\nThink one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nAbout what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents who have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have said all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but well we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct DUIs\nAllegations that they may be part of a gang\nAre people not reunited because of disorderly conduct do you ours\nAllegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about four year old kids three year old kids were not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the farm we will find them one way or the other we believe\n[noise] legal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for
