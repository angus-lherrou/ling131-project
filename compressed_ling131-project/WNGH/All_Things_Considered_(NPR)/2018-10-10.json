vehicles meet the same safety standards as other cars on the road and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal safety requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely or we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the limos should have their own standards because they're neither Carson or buses\nRegulation started Janet in between the two of them and have come up with that thing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a lot just came into effect in California it requires additional ... eggs\nLast thing limos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill cruising find has the c._e._o. of dread unlocks a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified the exits can be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars about him out from from from the value of those little\nButtons on day also says he personally would support more safety regulations\nThere should be nationwide triple regulations to make sure that these vehicles are up to be in a certain point\nSome stretch limos are safer than others he says companies can do hold tests where a powerful machine ... seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something before the impact of it or not when we installed a certain place underneath the vehicle and on the jury or the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say Leno's often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and find tastes as\nSome of the public not care about safety for ... they seem to care about\nThe price Rosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the onus shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's this really grossly unfair people of course they always care about safety I just think most people assume that if there and the business that that their minimum requirements that they have to me\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety\nAnd twenty Fifteen there was a deadly Leno crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issued a call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never even heard about them\nLevine of the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nNational limousine association says it never even heard about them\nLevine of the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut uh if we're going to continue to talk of of moving out of D.C streets lead the way I wouldn't be terrible\nInvestigators are still working out exactly what happened in New York last weekend when the two thousand one Ford stretch limousine crashed and kill twenty people but they already know that limo had failed inspection and the driver wasn't properly licensed Camila Domonoske NPR News [noise]\nAnd then I was reading some schools are had reopened the rest of the craving county schools that had been shot since

quality of life\nThat that doesn't get any better and yeah we just really can't think\nWithin fifty miles because they love it we love it is the quality of life that that doesn't get any better and\nWe just really think like America enough for what they've been doing for us and we in turn are working with our sister towns and cities around New Bern Jones county ... county right and to try to help them get back together\nWell mayor Dana outlaw of New Bern North Carolina we wish you good luck and stay safe thanks so much time\nStocks\nPlunged on Wall street today us stocks all their biggest sell off in six months the Dow fell eight hundred thirty one points which is a three percent declined to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what part of the market funded punish today\nWell a tech was particularly hit hard it's been the foundation of a this market but ah all of the um all sectors really were down um\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk gain since mid summer\nBut the tech sector has been the hardest hit and ... and as I said it's one of the foundations of the market in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the S. and P. five ... which also has a lot of tech lost three and a third percent so it was a tough day ... day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate and the Federal Reserve has said that will continue to raise rates ... suggested I Will stop raising two it's ... it has been smart rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contributed to do this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous in fact\nUh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable a and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve\nHas said it will continue to raise rates gradually and as soon as you suggested will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go there are some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a lot of employment at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets the wages will begin to rise\nBut they're related to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets the wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more inflation pressures\nOkay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market what happened well\nThe economy is strong in the U.S and most comedies are saying today sellers is not the end of a double marketing stocks so a while the U.S economy remains strong\nUm Europe is cool to bed and so ever merging markets a the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago\nAnd of course there are these concerns about a global trade war\nAre disrupting a the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China so\nWhat we saw today is this could this be the beginning of a long downward trend well\nMost analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading uh driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling\nGiven the strength to the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit is it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down\nBut there are are are points where investors are looking over the horizon nine months to a year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession All right That's NPR's John Ydstie thanks time You're welcome [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn Wyoming state officials are proposing new rules to

U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing ... correct\nIs as us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on ... to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that descend these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after a he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence gained it with these intercepts I eat did they ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn if the U.S government believes that someone is about\nPoint is whether anyone from the U.S government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talked to reporters like you were I I think there's a\nReal concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm has come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that visit administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a bay trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia when\nYou talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade at the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports that Supreme Court\nCan't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon\nThe justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ... CEO of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed and uh but very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the vest cases to move forward to fit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKevin is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn said in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation that have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this court\nThose efforts will now be supersized ... says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal laws\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad network of states and providers across the country where abortion will still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the mid term elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican\nFor the mid term elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are monitoring\nMay rallies also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents like Mallory Quigley of the Susan B.

we've been engaging in Senate races across the country since last summer and that's because you know precisely the Senate is where Supreme Court justices ark and armed\nWith Kevin on the Supreme Court advocates on both sides say their bases are energized and ready for the next phase of the battle over abortion rights Sarah McCammon NPR News\nBut if we're going to have that debate else it's probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true he\nHas made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare\nAnd they've proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees the insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker

tropical storm as NPR's Tom Gjelten\nFifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas\nTomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm as NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerge weeks after the storm has passed\nThe market north apartment complex in Wilmington U Haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm intact but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate for\nDoubt where to go\nGary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can't find new housing for them the apartment owners giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash but Moore says that won't go far\n... and they know they tell us to go to a movie with ... to do it at all like\nThis or a more his girlfriend's terrorists who kings sits in a chair by the front door her head in her hands\nThe red cross here so it was about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back\nSchools that sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe close during the hurricane we actually opened back up\nTo date for the public after the hurricane um but\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three

disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck coming\nSmall businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless a business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you'll have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced and you can't get them back [noise] so it delays your ability to open up your store or your restaurant or\nFor your business FEMA famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped to disapprove that production but it's too soon to tell whether it's with the economy or housing some injury becomes apparent only as time goes by\nTom Gjelten NPR News Wilmington North Carolina\nYou're listening to all

decline started talking about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey Jon Kyl so so what made the market plummeted eh\nYeah it was a tough day a and a number of things contributed let's start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop praising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get there\nSo the way I understand it the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation right there you're than inflation right now\nWell federal research or a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressure so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market economy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bowl marketing stocks here but while the U.S economy\nRemains strong Europe has called a bit as have emerging markets and the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week or less going than it did just a few months ago\nOf course there are concerns about a global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies the U.S in China and that hurts stocks\nAre there any

been\nVirtually all sectors of the markets sold off today of wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest\nAnd it's been one of the foundations of this bull market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today and that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tax lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech and very tough day but is it just the beginning of along down or trying for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so tempted to selling toward the end of the day which took the doubt down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling a given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point or investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then
