I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nOh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nOr these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help a lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year\nWhat are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grade [noise]\n... middle school eighth grader ... leaves in the

talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad suicide\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nTo share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking and the public health world the ideas\nThat you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing at its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this was going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\n... husband grew up here was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seen as a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or ... dad an uncle and this ... a national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nAre we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super
