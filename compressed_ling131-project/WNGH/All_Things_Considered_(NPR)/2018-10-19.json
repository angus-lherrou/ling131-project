difference continuing stability in the world oil market but at the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... said something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves\nHe's David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world David Cay wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this war to war court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate could showcased disappearance on perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor\nAnd they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the consulate they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly I think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically theoretically maximum five people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work ... she disappeared and allegedly was murdered\nTheoretically maximum five people [noise]\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work ... she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go to people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course\nWith you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's house\nGetting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen\nAnd then what happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find of course they could ignore it\nI think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S\nEvidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials\nSo if you would have this kind of a report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but\nAs it stands right now we're left with\nA simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[laughter] so you say you can do this to say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there is a lot of politics around this the human rights council\nCan do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question\nI mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included\nStates like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid Cay he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expression thanks very much thank you\nNot a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district at state representative Tony Rivera\nHave any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support\nHispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values that the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as the knock on doors [noise]\nOnly going to take some time I was on the river almost the Republican running for reelection hum I'm here answering the questions they may have topics including our budget education

immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is how I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico separating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news that doesn't look good\n... you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan immigrants from Mexico and um this is an issue where I go sideways with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws\nA country of opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration\nOne that includes border security\nOne that legalize as a people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing um\nI'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor ... who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east Dale I asked\nYou see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican or in in the reelection a study to see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nDo the hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as to approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nGovernor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican\nAnd may make calls for he is not suggesting\nPort certain policies\nThe national Republican\nAnd may make calls for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them\nWhen you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am belching producing\nBut under that logic\nIf Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids\nGoing to feel the same way he does\nHe see what's going on to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got ... votes\nAnd they said that we were ready to go where they're over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor

mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very little tasked by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick trucks\nAnd so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me so many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly did emails that\nI've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nIt tell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition with the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up as sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nOf course take books from libraries but you also get to leave them I have to say that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going

in there and you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd Bowles when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing thing being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new

accused a Russian accountant of information warfare federal prosecutors say it's an attempt by Russia to disrupt the upcoming midterm elections\nNPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is following this case and joins us now he carry Hi Elsa\nSo how does that count and how does she fit into the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in us elections her name is Elena ... she's from St Petersburg Russia and she still inside Russia Today\nProsecutors have charged her with conspiracy to defraud the United states she was the counting the bean counter for this Russian Campaign to interfere with elections here in the U.S and others around the world\nBetween twenty sixteen and twenty Eighteen the budget for this operation was thirty five million dollars but the OJ says only part of that was spent buying ads and setting up\nA discourse here in America now this woman works for a company controlled by a Russian oligarch also known as ... chef because he got his certain catering that oligarch has already faced us sanctions and accompanied tied to him was already charged in Washington DC earlier this year\nNow these are the first charges federal prosecutors have filed over Russian interference in the mid term elections what do they tell us about\nHow Russians are conducting this so called information warfare\nThese people are awfully persistent this effort certainly continued even after large numbers of Russians were charged earlier this year by the special counsel Robert Mueller and today's charges do not involve the Mueller team\nThis cases being brought by the U.S attorney in Alexandria, Virginia ... and the Justice Department's national security division asked for the Russian am oh here it seems to involve using divisive issues like gun control immigration race relations exploiting divisions already within the United states\nThe court papers include examples of Facebook ads and language that beats up on former President Obama\nLate Senator John McCain of Arizona and offered directions to the co conspirators like listen Russians if you're posting something that's aimed at American liberals don't mention the website Breitbart and likewise if you're targeting us conservatives steer clear of mentioning both feet so it'd be like some sophistication about their audience\nAnd U.S intelligence officials delivered another warning about election security shortly after these charges were announced what were they concerned about what was the warning this was a joint statement from\nIntelligence officials delivered another warning about election security shortly after these charges were announced what were they concerned about what was the warning\nThis was a joint statement from the director of national intelligence the FBI and the department of homeland security and they say they're concerned about ongoing campaigns by Russia China and other foreign adversaries including Iran to undermine confidence in elections and how to use social media to target American voters\nBut they add we don't have any evidence of a compromise or disruption\nThat would basically prevent people from voting or change vote counts I\nKnow you also spent some time in uh Virginia courthouse today your job never ends you were they're following the ongoing saw that Paul Manafort President Trump's former campaign chairman what's the latest there yeah the judge in Virginia has dismissed ten charges on which that Virginia a jury deadlocked earlier this year he sent a sentencing date\nFor Paul Manafort for February twenty Nineteen Manafort of course has pleaded guilty in a related case in Washington DC he's cooperating with investigators\nAnd the judge says if Manafort cooperation is not done by the time of sentencing he can always get a break or leniency later on\n... ... ... Elsa Manafort up here today in court and in green jail uniform in a wheelchair his lawyer Kevin downing says he has some health issues\nA source close to Manafort says it's a problem with his diet in

Central America for refuge in the United states have been mast and whereas today they broke through an immigration barrier and tried to enter Mexico from Guatemala\nMexican security forces appealed for order and then fired tear gas to drive the migrants back\nPresident Trump has already weighed in he's saying to Mexico for his efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala hide James\nEarly so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were matched\nA few minutes away from the border what would happen today\nThis group of migrants Mel grown to ... and we don't know exactly how many thousands of migrants so decided they were going to march bridge the ... and Mexico and they tried to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic\nDecided they were going to march through the grids that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know if I can just try to summarize it as quickly as possible\nThat they were at the fence walking them from leaving Guatemala they got through that same styles and people started walking across the bridge into Mexico Mexico has closed up big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear ratings for their care of him\nThen I wasn't close enough to be what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots or that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from his father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nDon't get\nSee what [noise]\nWhat he said when she went to the front what his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then the chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here ... it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside of the border but still writes here near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of cops are from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really the\nHydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cop now he's probably\nFour years old has a has a cold rag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who've said suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke a and B hydration as well as some people who actually suffered a broken bone in the classroom\nAnd as you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and across this bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what their request thing is for Mexico to let them and as asylum seekers and so\nThey are many of them say we are not going to leave us friends who are going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to close\nThe British into Mexico and given the clashes in Mexico has totally closed the border uh you know I tried to get back into Mexico and we're not everyone so it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going\nIn the seconds we have left dreams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and Iran getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are very aware of the president's position\nThey're aware of the uh trumps of not wanting to let them into other countries for what they say over and over again as we know that stance but we're going we're pleading for help because you know whatever Trump what's in front of our\nWaters burned at home is worse than whatever trend\nIs James Frederick reporting from Guatemala and Mexico border [noise]\n\nMeanwhile while view the secretary of state\nAnd his whole delegation are in Saudi Arabia here in Washington President Trump floated the idea of rogue killer\nIt sounded to me like maybe there's a big role\nFillers no we're going to try getting to the bottom love at first\nIt was presented to support the theory were you and other reporters on the plane able to ask compared to what's going on because\nHe kept his distance from us the whole day or when he was having these meetings and it was only after he had met with Mohammed didn't sell them on the young crown prince is really kind of the power broker in Saudi Arabia President Trump called in to this meeting and President Trump was the first\nWorking right now Donald Trump tweeting just moments ago just spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nTotally denied any knowledge of what took place in the Turkish cause all was he was with secretary of state Mike Pompeo during then the state department had to put out a statement\nTotally denied any knowledge of what took place in the Turkish causal was it was what secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nDuring then the state department had to put out a statement confirming that Trump had called in and that the crown prince had in fact denied that he had any knowledge of this and that the king denied as well\nTrump and moved on his back here in Washington again he gave an interview to the a P on Tuesday in which he compared the allegations against him ... to allegations against his Supreme Court nominee now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh the president's\nSaying here in a in an interview with the Associated Press quote here we go again where you're guilty until proven innocent\nOf my shell column and you buy now you're left Riyadh you've flown on to turkey where of course ... ... has disappeared Turkish investigators are presenting all kinds of evidence does Mike Pompeo see he's found anything out he's found any facts at this\nPoint no and in fact it was astounded because we it was as we were leaving Riad we asked him point blank ... did the Saudis tell you that this Washington Post columnist was dead yeah what they say he said\nI don't want to talk about any of the facts\nThey they didn't want to either and if they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation go so far away\nAnd he called that an incredible success\nI'm guessing there were some follow up questions among the press corps on the flight home as you all are headed back you flew back Wednesday from Ankara back to Washington After this mission that was not to find out the facts of what happened you land a and then the next thing we hear from the administration is we need to give the Saudis more time\nThat's right and and he did say that on the on the trip as well because we asked him about the optics of this um that it looks like business as usual with the Saudis and he insisted that he had very direct conversations that they were serious but he also went into this long line of ... prompted defense of the relationship\nI Do think it's important that everyone keeping their mind we walk just important\nFor relationships with us from Saudi company\nGovernmental relationships things we walk on together all across the world\nParticularly now as the as this administration is trying to reimpose sanctions on Iran they need the Saudis to maintain the oil markets they need the Turks to stop buying so much crude oil from Iran so there's a lot of geopolitics here at play and this one\nMaintain the oil markets they need the Turks to stop buying so much crude oil from Iran so there's a lot of geopolitics here at play and this one particular case\nSo here we close a business on friday a Seventeen Days after Jamal ... walked into that Saudi consulate in Istanbul and disappeared [noise] are we any closer to answers on the the two key questions what happened\nAnd what does the U.S going to do about it [noise] not\nReally I mean that there is a moving in Congress to push for at least some targeted sanctions against those people who were found to have been involved in this um and the administration has\nTo respond to that President Trump is said the consequences are going to be theory I don't\nHave to be very severe evidence is bad but uh but we'll see what happens but like you really want\nTo give the Saudis a few more days to come up with their story and in the meantime the Turks have been leaking all kinds of information and and very gruesome details about this case\nAnd parents Michelle ... thank you thank you\nAnd and the last word on this story for now talking to reporters today Trump pointed out Congress will have a role in the U.S response to ... Jews disappearance he also pointed out that Saudi investment creates jobs in many of their states and he added quote I Hope we don't lose track of that\n\n\nYou're listening\nTo all things considered

G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal details\nOf uh of ... killing and\nThose same really quite at odds with what ... what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight to em seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nOr is that the credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\n[noise] I think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve analyzing what the what the Turkish authorities had been giving to the news media over the last a week or two\nOr it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion\nMhm [noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nTo put this in motion mhm [noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide\nUh they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to to the veto of any of the five\nPermanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary they could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council absolutely\nAnd there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international lies it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about how beautiful but we're talking about a credible international investigation that David Cay thank you\nThank you use the un special representative and this is NPR News [noise]\nBuild it

was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming
