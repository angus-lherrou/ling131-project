Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow\nToday we're going to talk about how ... views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement and about the threat that this movement poses my guess ... slow as a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter\nWho is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred and focus is on the story of Derek Black\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties and a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\nHe says low welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nDared black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father done but it's still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find ... story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter rubber ... hours\nThink you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter a straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body attached to a fourteen idiots to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a fourteen word\nFor statement of purpose that is central to what storm frog does about um securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at you know and and saying things like I'm here because of the white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was out to synagogue that's exactly the the language in the motivation to exist on store front and that's the way that they speak about this\n... as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's the way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is under way\nThat gap is pretty small and and the social media space I mean I think it's about a half million users and but uh it really embraces this sort of radical idea of free speech above all else I'm so somebody like Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist who does not have a platform on Twitter because Twitter doesn't\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there and there is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab you know and I think the danger of a place like gab and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and Bowers when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and\nThat those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[laughter] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In store front is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founder son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nSome really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on strike\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on strong front over over the last decade and and the reaction has mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global health and ah choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you know I have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages but Derek in particular and you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken uh and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels and small waves culpable and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular icing on the movement said to then have somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people\nAnd leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nHe likes that slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Garrett black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\nPianist Conrad town says George Gershwin was trying to prove himself when he wrote this Gershwin

B.\nS. is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included fast slow the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like a popular everywhere and white nationalism is it that was his thing\nHere he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's is totally irrational how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy candidate\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism [noise]\nThey really did believe they were not doing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred\nBully they were not doing bad things to other people that\nThe uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nThe assumption was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nOr they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the ... the word [noise] um\nRatio is Rachel ... over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing and and cause of separating or\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam White supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still\nEffective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derek ... a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who wrote a book about black cloud rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and carry gross and this is fresh air\nThat's called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh

kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against due\nSo it's still the language of vines you just changed to the actors are\nAnd who are the victims and who they are ... and the ... and this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section\nAnd quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors the day where the people were making society worse\nTo being attacked ... it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote cure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids\nIt's usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nThink it's important to note also that the entire\nIdeology the endpoint the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing fits that that is and that even white nationalists when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how to are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front but there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and where something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\n[laughter] we're listening to the interview I recorded in September ... black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post's reporting ... the author of a book about Jared black and

his views when he was twenty to\nHis father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front we're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo there are one of the things you did you had been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views [noise]\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida there were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must a publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God it's Derek Black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when they found out who you really are um you have Jewish friends who reached out to you\nPrinted people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when they found that he really are um you have Jewish friends who reached out to you even had a girlfriend who dated didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends\nSaid to you that\nMade sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew ... dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart of it\nOr not talking to me about it uh I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every ... other thing that we were possibly interested and did a and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from and it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually\nActually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human\nIn a way that you hadn't paid for\nThe I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people to back off\nIn addition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school\nProfound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a\nCivil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of ... out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one is trust built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through and and uh\nAnd showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that just by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes\nTo the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative and I think\nIt's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and in the white nationalist ideology in like the\nAwful pyramid of beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThat Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and uh are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and", "show_name": "Fresh Air
