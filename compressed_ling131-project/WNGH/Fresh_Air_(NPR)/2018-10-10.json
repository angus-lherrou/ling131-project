about Neil Armstrong and\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was\n[noise] what could you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in space craft sets out of control [noise] did you do any simulation exercises you can viscerally experience it and therefore portraying\nWe tried to shoot it in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used full scale replicas of these capsules there were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were\nExactly the same our production designer an ... an incredible job sort of rebuilding these things and we'd we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically would move and rock back and forth\nQuite violently if we needed them to uh and we would set those up against a giant Eli D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule of simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then then the audience is gonna feel at the actors are going to be that much more in it\nThis real reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real to shake and we'll be real even some of the terror will be real the knowledgeable the rail and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling um all of that\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we uh Ryan I both wanted to try to make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up to the question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to a\nClass area and I was getting ... from we we have to take\nA we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or gives rise to type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you a rest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\nAnd another thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise [laughter] I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quiet at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't than\nSay can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about [laughter]\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules word\nThat that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is ... machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike a spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit and an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little drones and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the men on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe [noise]\nAnd so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't just in case they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release your Reggie um get get that actually happened yeah\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moving disaster um and uh was sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nCuring Heinz who plays about Gilbert movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find online and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI I actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given but in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the\nWillingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on\nAnd and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically uh uh from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon\nWill know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures or could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew it was riding his obituary ... [noise]\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nUh lived their lives and in seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often bulged out or at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nI guess just ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and like ... a new set of young minds recordings of ... I'm Terry Gross and fresh air uh\nAnd you've our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and his commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from tire Iraq with more than five hundred tire models from twenty to manufacturers\nAnd an online tool for finding tires based on vehicle meets budget and brand\nTire rock dot com helping drivers find deliver install\nFrom TI eighty eight CIA is committed to helping those who are driven by purpose reached their definition of success\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon\nYou think about the American flag\nAnd I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie and then he's asked do you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nThe controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was a\nPretty much exclusively among people who haven't seen the film\nAnd I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused I think uh uh obviously the wedding was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show at least show it several times so to flex dating bear on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know ... and showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking up the road into the into the litter soil and propping up at the flag\nOr we made a choice entirely anesthetic toys not a political one to focus on Neal's private moments on the moon or during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing\nDarlene aesthetic choice not a political one to a focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon or during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spent about eight minutes on the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down\nThen after his famous wine or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone away from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching those\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show and that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nI guess is Damien ... he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air [noise]\nThey leaders emergency crews and residents have been preparing for a monster storm churning through Georgia\nI was going to buy a\nSoap as it but we know to fill out to about one of water I got ...

[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong\nAnd starting Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ... [noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think it was a music he actually brought with him to play after the space finding my right about that\nThis is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah so it's it's a ...\nPiece called lunar Rhapsody yep and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapist in this incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your way to the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so\nHow did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal is with the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from divorced shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually the ... uh listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nIn space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for\nOne listening no damage control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nYou know why don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nNo\nLenora ... which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and ... and the new movie first men which is directed by ... who also directed la la land and where did too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you know I hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man uh and uh so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kinda languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise] I've been\nTrying to get a made for a while and with no success and and a three large stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and fell in love with it and and and winter Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting\nA first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\n[noise] so I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man\nWhich there's so much technical stuff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like Republicans and real size and then miniatures it it's it's [noise]\nYou know la la land was a complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level [noise]\nYeah I mean uh I think everything you described gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they went to see themselves they're going to see their family life", "year": "2018", "show_name":
