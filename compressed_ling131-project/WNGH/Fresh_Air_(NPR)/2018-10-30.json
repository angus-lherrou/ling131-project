no ambassador for skateboarding\nAnd skateboarding so sensitive\nTo being portrayed in film by outsiders\nThat's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was\nMaybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a wins that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um [noise]\nThe treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness\nOr or just wait and improve on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were\nFriends with our aspired to be friends was what was that culture like\nAnd watch skateboarding is a natural draw to someone who takes hits\nWhether inflicted from someone else would themself\nWhy do you think it's a natural draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again

ever try submitting one\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would you\nBe willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly [noise] ah\nWhich just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignored the content mattress hurting so bad I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because if my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old\nWho was who Marge was Don Corleone because of nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet location\nBecause as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn\n[noise] no excuse me she's Michael Sallah OK okay charges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer and\nNo Homer see that would be that would make Marge Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nAs Diane Keaton like when are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but uh Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny\nI don't know I mean if I actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who ... to\nThink about story and character in that way and to make connections between things I I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because [noise]\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine than when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine stay on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so\nI Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we're so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie and it's the seminal\nMovie in my life kid is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids it's so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned in the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see\nIs all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot Marta fail because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] I was like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also about the film I think the raping ultra violence was just too\nOf course there was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and ... they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something
