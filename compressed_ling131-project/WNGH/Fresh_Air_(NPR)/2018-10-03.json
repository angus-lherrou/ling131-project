P. B. [noise]\nTouchdown John Nelson you for your money the football isn't just a sport here in the south it's a way of life every ... our travels they cover a high school for ... G v but there's still a lot to talk about joined me for the both parties in Georgia broadcast to build on GB Donald and wherever they want to survive [noise]\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross back with Annette Benning\nIn the last few years I feel like I've been seeing you and more movies and really happy about that I think I'm right in saying that you kind of slow down when you were raising your children your four children [noise] um so are you kind of fully back in the sun vet now that your children are in a late teens and twenties\n[noise] it has definitely made a difference on how young is a stain just turned Eighteen she's just about to go away so\nAh yeah no it does make a difference because when they're little you've got to be on the floor and when you're on the floor a lot of the time you can't be off doing stuff but um yeah so that's true I hadn't been able to do more and that's great fun for me I really enjoyed being able to respond spontaneously and go off and do stuff when I can\nI think for women it's kinda frightening to take time off to raise their children\nBecause they never know if they want a career they not enough they'll be able to get back in one they feel ready when I feel like their child or children are old enough to re enter the players are re enter full time were you ever worry that people in the movie industry would forget you\nUm there were times I suppose I Would worry about that I also found that when I stopped for the first time\n[noise] um there were times I suppose I Would worry about that I also found that when I stopped for the first time to have my first baby [noise] I really lost the desire to work and that was quite a shock because I'd always loved it so much and I thought oh no you know does this mean\nThey're not going to want to do it anymore but what I realized was thought that was a cyclical thing and it happened each time I had a baby and [noise]\nI really enjoyed being away from show business quite frankly I really enjoyed stopping and turning away and the other direction of life and I and just being with my family and [noise]\nSo that was a great pleasure and then I was able to stop and start a lot which I never really thought about that before I had kids\nAs an actress that that would be such a wonderful thing to be able to do because of course so many people can't they just can't stop and start but in my profession I can so\nUh I was able to take years off at a time um and then I guess I had just sort of enough going on that I felt like there would be something out there when I went back but there's always ... and ups and downs and that certainly was true for me [noise] did it make you feel good that\nYou were secure enough in your identity that you were able to leave work for periods and to even lose your desire to work and still know who you were to not feel insecure like what\nMy fans might forget me are casting directors my forget me directors my for me\nUm I I don't remember feeling that really a ... a lot I I'm sure I went through moments of being concerned about that but\nI had wanted to be a mom since I was a little kid literally since I was a little girl probably eight or nine years old because I was the youngest of four and I wanted my mom to have another baby because I Want it to be a big ... and she wouldn't do it\nAnd right at that time I I I remember starting to glom onto like the little kids in my neighborhood so I Would be playing\nWith the next door neighbor who was a toddler and kind of taking care of them a little bit and I started babysitting when I was twelve and I just I've always wanted to be a mom it's just became very early to me that I wanted to be a mom always attracted me\nA long before I even really knew what that was about except I guess watching my own mom ah so that was something that was to is was and is so much a part of me that um maybe also I just [noise]\nMy own mom ah so that was something that was to is was and is so much a part of me that um maybe also I just had so many kids so quickly I was just too busy to\n[laughter] [laughter] we ... you were\nOne of four children in your family and you have four children of your own as for the magic number for you\nI you know I when I was little my dream was to have five I don't know why I got on to that number maybe it's because I Want to do do my own mother and say I have five I don't know um I always wanted a big family the idea of\nThe sound of kids in the house and the chaos of lot of a big family with all of the stuff that comes with that always interested me and uh\nI have to admit that sound when my kids are home and everybody's around and I I hear that sound in the house of people talking and laughing and of course in some cases arguing or maybe there's a door slam or\nWhatever that is I Love that I I I was always wanted that although I looked at other people that only had two\nAnd I thought oh that's so sensible you know on the hand but I for some reason I just couldn't stop and my husband was the same way he really wanted to have a big family too so we just kept going [laughter]\nI Want to play a scene from a film in which you played a mother and this is the film twentieth century women I Love this film and I love your performance in it and it was written and directed by Mike Mills who based it a bit on his own mother [noise] and so you play a single mother\nWho is in her fifties and who is whose son is now a teenager and she feels him just like drifting away from her\nBecause now he's into the world of like punk rock and skate boards and this is the world she knows nothing about and it's set in Nineteen Seventy nine and so much has changed\nFrom the time of her use to the time of his views\nAnd she reflects on that at the beginning of the movie but in in this scene your son has just\nParticipated in this game with his friends which like you hyper ventilate and then somebody like squeezes your diaphragm from behind and you kind of pass out for a few seconds except\nYour son passes out for like a half hour as always rush to the hospital and you you're kind of like crying at his bedside and then when he kind of comes to and you find\nFor like a half hour as always rush to the hospital and you you're kind of like crying at his bedside and then when he kind of comes to when he finally comes home you ask him like why would you do that why did you do something so stupid and chairs that scene [noise]\n\nJust went along with it [noise]\nIt was fun just dumb why would you do something stupid [noise]\nJust following along you do you know you almost died\nYou don't have to worry about what makes you think\nWhat is going on for white [noise]\nBut you're not going to talk to me now [noise]\nNot going to talk\nCome on you scared the hell out of neat\nWhy why did you hurt yourself like why do you smoke yourself the\nFind being shouted alone [noise]\n[noise] you can't talk to me like that we don't you don't say that to me\n[noise] so that's a scene from the twenty sixteen film twenty century women with my guests Annette Benning and Lucas jade zoom in as her son [noise]\nSo I Know Mike Mills wrote and directed the movie based your character in part on his own mother who do you draw from to become a character and are there things you took from your own life as a mother and from how you saw your mother mothering you\n[noise] uh I think that happens every time I'm working um that I think about my own experiences and my certainly my experiences with my own mom I have a great mom I Love her dearly she's a really great to all of us um\nInteresting I wanted to just mentioned that scene Mike wrote we we were able to do some additional shooting after we had done the the bulk of the movies sometime later and he added that scene he wrote it and added in\nLater and so we came back\nThe movies sometime later and he added that scene he wrote it and added in\nLater and so we came back to shoot that so I think that's the reason I mentioned that is for a couple of reasons for people who do this kind of work to to remember that that kind of thing happens and sometimes those are the\nThose are the things if you have that kind of time to do if you have the money to go back and shoot a little bit more sometimes you can add things in which really are key and Mike did it very strategically and I thought wisely [noise]\nHaving conversations with that with your mom about that with your mother\n[noise] yes I think I did and I definitely remember when it was for me it was when I went to community college in San Diego I went to school called Mesa college I'm very proud of that and\nSo that would have been seven the six Seventy seven and um I took a women's studies class and I remember getting so mad at the injustices of the world for the first time [laughter]\nAh I'm laughing now but I was I was I was literally woken up and I realized how uh how an equal the world was and I remember\nThe idea of beauty contests at that time I remember one of them being on television and I just burst into tears and the uh out at how a\nDisgusting of a display that was and um so yeah no I remember that very well in fact I also remember when I was at ... college Jane Fonda came and spoke\nAt our little community college in San Diego and she was talking about feminism and the women's movement\nAnd I remember she had like waist length hair that really made a big impression on me [laughter] anyway so yes I remember it very well and um it was a time that people were really waking up to these things in a new way and it meant a lot to me\nAnd I think it meant a lot to my mother as well I think like the character in a movie that I've\nReally waking up to these things in a new way and it meant a lot to me\nAnd I think it meant a lot to my mother as well I think\nLike the character in Mike's movie that I played my mom is a feminist at heart and she also is someone who really loved raising her kids and loved being at home and love the role that she played and being there for us in the way that she was\nAnd that doesn't didn't ever feel any\nUh ambivalence about that really she was that was her life and she she was one of those people that was born at that time who was really good with that and and embrace that [noise] so you\nUh starred with Julianne Moore in at least a chill the Dingell movie the kids are All right and you played un Julianne Moore played a married couple with two teenage children who were father by a sperm donor and anonymous donor\nThe teenage daughter tracks down the sperm donor and you were left only agreed to a family meeting with him and he changes the whole family dynamic your kids started hanging out with him\nYou lay to figure out your spouse Julianne Moore's character as having an affair with him on a play seeing this happens at a restaurant after you after you've had a fight\nYou you you're at a table with some friends you and Julianne Moore have had a fight and then you go to to the bar part of the restaurant and start trying to talk it through but the fight fight gets a little worse [noise]\nWhat is going on with you\nI feel like you're taking or my family no\nNo he's not [noise]\nI guess I'm just exhausted [noise]\nRight who's going to pay for that [noise]\nI mean look I'm Sorry but uh you know I feel like I'm Carrying the whole load here\nDo you want to be at home taking care of the kids you wanted a white that is just not true you didn't like any other nannies and short in back of my career what are you talking about I just hope to start another business yeah so you can feel better about yourself [noise]\nAre you talking about I just helped you start another business yeah so did you feel better about [noise]\nSo you can feel better about yourself [noise]\nCast my guest and bending the Julian more from the twenty ten movie the kids are All right what parts of yourself did you are drawn to play this role [noise] uh\nLet's see I I Love this part I felt so at home in it I uh I Love Nick locked [laughter]\nUm gosh I I guess it it just like always that's what I always do is draw on parts of myself I'm\nWhen I'm working so I'm sure I have a part of me that is trying to control I'm sure that I'm sure my husband and my kids probably too I think I keep it under control that I'm not too I'm not too bad with that but certainly that's true\nUm I Would say I have that yet [noise] um so I'm\nThinking I'm thinking that in the past few years you've probably thought a lot about sexual orientation and about gender and part because of this role and the kids are All right\nAnd also because I Know your oldest son is trans and I know you try to let him speak for yourself and not speak on his behalf and I will not ask you to do that but I have a quick question about you [noise] having\nI'm just having a trans son [noise]\nUm\nAnd having played a lesbian in a movie has gotten you to think any differently about issues of\nIdentity when it comes to sexual orientation or gender [noise] I salute way\nAnd it's one of the the one of the pleasures of acting is that every time we get to enter this other imaginative world that's not our own\nUh or this case sexual orientation or whatever it's such a fabulous I'm In a way to expand your own heart and your own thinking\nBecause when you play a character you have this fabulous thing that you can be completely subjective and you don't have to judge the person you only have to totally back them up here they're advocate\nYou're fighting for everything that's in their lives just like in some ways we fight for what's important to us in our own lives and with my children I feel like especially now that they're young\nThat's in their lives just like in some ways we fight for what's important to us in our own lives and with my children [noise]\nI feel like especially now that they're young adults um I'm just learning more and more from them for so long you know you feel like you're teaching your children about the world and now for sure I feel the opposite way is that they're teaching me about the world that is true of all of my kids certainly true of my oldest son Stephen\nThat there's been a whole new kind of universe opened up to me and to all of us in the family because of Stephen because who he is and um that is a fantastic part of being a parent I Love it\n[noise] so here's a question about um gender identity that I Want to ask you as the parent I'm a trans teenage son um was it a steep learning curve for you to learn about that [noise]\nUm yeah it was uh my son's down twenty six and so when he came out it was many many many many years ago when he was a teenager so yeah it was definitely and I think there's a lot more out there now\nFor people to read about to understand because it's so much more a part of the cultural conversation that you describe your\nParents as being very politically conservative and you and your husband are both very liberal do your parents support President Trump and if so has that been a source of disagreement or subject to avoid and my family [noise] I Love my parents\nSo deeply they're such great people I'm so\nProud of them they're amazing and they are Republicans and they are Trump supporters\nIt's actually been quite a relief I think in my family and with my kids that they have somebody if they choose to to debate with a because so many of our friends not all of them but many of our friends are Democrats as well\nSo it's been a healthy thing in the family I I really enjoy it and uh we we do talk politics not too much and uh\nI mean when I was a kid growing up we understood the rules for politics and sex they weren't articulate it a lot of sort of an unspoken thing\nUm when I was growing up uh so even though my parents are were very a conservative it wasn't like we sat around and talked about politics all the time however in our house we do we talk about politics in ...\nSo even though my parents are are very a conservative it wasn't like we sat around and talked about politics all the time however in our house we do we talk about politics incessantly and all of my kids are also very a political and they read and everyone's always talking about something and debating about something\nSo the debates sort of ... that have happened with my parents\nAre good natured and um respectful I have to say it's never gotten ugly um there've been a few times I did have to breathe deeply in order to continue the conversation and I'm sure they felt the same way\n[noise] so um you're fifty nine now to my knowledge you haven't had cosmetic surgery and your face has some natural wrinkles in it and I want to thank you for that\nI understand and respect why many women and men would have worked on [noise] but as someone who isn't going to do that I I I really love seeing women and beautiful women like you age naturally\nAnd just see how life changes ones face and to see how beautiful you remain um and enables your face to be so much more expressive then if you've had had a lot of work done because I think your your skin gets stretched so tight\nIt's hard to have those kind of subtle", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "03"}
