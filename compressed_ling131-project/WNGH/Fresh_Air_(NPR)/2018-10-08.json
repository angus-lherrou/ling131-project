B.\nS. is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection and the ... collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to revisit palms but I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... breed a stone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it [noise]\nI'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes [noise]\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcends than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which you talked about the solitude of the experience of two of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that uh this is [noise]\nIs is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nAppreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there's so many performers who have performed his\nOf your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there's so many performers who have performed his songs so they have to have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd his and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in this room quietly reading his poems so\nI go and how they want to get on their record\nAs saying you know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men that of course when it's attached to song it's supposed to lift and ah and exist the way songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm a I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly summing through this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds that your father I Wonder if I don't I'm not being ... can tankers or intransigent if\nIt don't I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I play your father reading and that's another problem with his\nFrom the envy that we recorded in two thousand six a poem called titles and it was published in\nBook that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nHad the title poet and maybe I was one for a

everyone but I act to generously I'm no one found me out my reputation\nIt got up very early I hated to everyone but I act to generously and no one found me out\nMy reputation as a ladies' man was a

where you were talking about the connection of your father writing in solitude and the reader ... reading alone and as you ain't ordering his and during his solitude yeah as\nYou noted also kind of humor you know that I remember a loved one of his lens where he says uh feel so good not to love you like I did it's like they tore away my blindfold and said we're going to let this prisoner live that that was hilarious\nMy guess is Adam Cohen he's written a forward to a new collection of previously unpublished writings and drawings by his father Leonard calling\nAfter a break and we'll talk

that's nowhere to say goodbye burn a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear how you do you do meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing it\nUm but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if you played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course are heard them you know I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it faces of of audiences you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the mentality of at first you know as a child just the melodies general\nA deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older that was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\nAnd you grow older and then you then you sort of see how remember um\nI myself I\nWas making a record at the time and I'd scripted and uh I asked my father for counsel I said dad you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said\nHere's scrap your record that's an amateur move an amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\n[noise] and\nAt that moment I realized that um\nWhether love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh\nThat baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated\nHome five six I'm not the don't remember how much did you get to see us either after\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people should have been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um\nMy mother\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims and uh my father would often even park a caravan hum at the end\nYou get away from them at all but just to follow our own whims and my father would often even park a caravan hum at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home\n[noise] oh yeah the liquid he called it was like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived and those are long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things\nPut at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and he just lived there my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead in his care of in how long you have for\nFor he did that and variations of that trip my own entire life and and as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\n[noise] there's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible for the revival of his career\nUm his reconnection to people [noise]\nUm I ... around the world and that that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing is sold to sell the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um\nAnd like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\nYeah you know\nHe often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry and incredible\nThat with the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this this episode that you're referring to\nDid he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who know\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this\nMost unexpected and [noise] festive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um
