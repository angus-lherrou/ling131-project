in movies like bridesmaids and the heat and for her impersonation of President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight men more of the same name by the Israel\nIsrael who died in twenty fourteen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to Lula bank cat and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flop she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cats that bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by literary luminaries like

interesting movie character you will encounter this year [laughter] let's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confide your secret to jak hop\nA fellow alcoholic who scrape spy on charm wet

being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous seen\nOn the right in the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do grow sad comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay ...\nNone of us felt that way about\nAnd could do grow sad comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and then ... none of us felt\nThat way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film [noise] kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny [noise]\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nLike the type of thing you watch and go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it because it's weird things like this do happen\nAnd I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the earth swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately [noise] even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like you just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter]\nWithin it'd be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality and by doing gross out scenes yours mine was really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended it was really talked about\nBecause I'm I'm I'm not one for bathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people [noise]\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for\nIt's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults [laughter]\nInsulting oh no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I Would have no no I don't know why are you not but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that same it starts with you\nPeople are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep on a leash than he would hit him with his car did you say that\nThat's that's ridiculous\nWho talks like that you do have to say or even you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly no no what he what he said to me was he told me what language\nCatherine language and to me to relate what these two balls to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her saying next door or a\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake couple let's say a big commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like your ... and my legs and kick you out in a job with my ... bone\nReally scaring me this is what happens when you corner you corner me I Will throw you out to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insults is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nKnow I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back\nAnd like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that I never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say you said all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of logging into my memory how'd you improv insults before [noise]\nYes I've had a ... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything just to kind of kind of tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her\nIn her own authority so it was a big part of that character at your very aggressive detective and that very aggressive detective um [noise] there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life [noise]\nI

I. A. dot org\n[noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career\nSo um did you perform at\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to ...\nSo um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there\nWhich is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nWhen you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nTo one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shut them now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it [noise]\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking what was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler oh God [noise]\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know I was always kind of go down that road of like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who [noise]\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do votes and then talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me\nAnd they are but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally be truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she is a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with\nNow he actually feels bad like ... to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\n[noise] and they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching sang times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh ever present uh not to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man I'd have flash it at like ... yes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics be you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a all my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on a laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I [noise]\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him ...\nPlaying link or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get\nGood roles [noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought\nI Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed you know often challenging but to me really real women\nI just thought so many things I read your kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was\nReally blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all [laughter] I said I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like\nWhy doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer\nI just ... I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\nI'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement which you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporary\nThat you've been affected by the me too movement which you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for\nAssaulting or Ratzinger mental behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now [noise]\nEvery little inch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's as branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need\nMoney for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and I think the more we we linked up and realize their strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse\nMelissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "22"}
