arrive kind of hopefully full so to speak and and\nThen you're what you're seeing partners in your director and but [noise]\nIs um [noise]\nSo collaborative it's more like\nYou know playing in an orchestra or something and maybe you're you're one of the you know you're the leader maybe I don't mean arrogant as me and that's the type of job you're dumb and honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any alone time 'cause I'm quite used to that somebody is always asking a question somebody or you have to make millions decision today [noise]\nBut I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew and sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nJust joining us my guest is Paul dino he probably know as an actor from films like there will be blood Little Miss sunshine and

of the same name let's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you have such an amazing performance and us here you're a teen evangelical preacher and a small port town in Southern California\nTurn of the twentieth century um during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there and\nUm there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis who is a bit of a con man and also of incredible capital as to comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and you become antagonist and in in one scene in Oregon here\nBasically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you and your makeshift church\nSo this is a scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parenthetically that the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another ah oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away\nOkay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and I know they let us\nVote\n\n[noise]

beating them up earlier in\nThe film that that you know it's almost like this incredible operatic do wet did you think of it that way when you're making [laughter]\nEver sort of intense just to hear that you know that time for me\nI I'm Irish sort of cast the last minute mess I started about four days after I was cast the most part\nThey were initially cast and\nYeah and then they\nAnd this and I started about four days after I was cast in this part\nHere initially cast as\nYeah and then they moved to be yeah\nIs that why those two characters became became twins are they not twins we're there were just brother brother and you know now that you were playing both of us so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bigger\nPart yeah I said I suppose so but you know one while

the character and in in in this empty church or I don't know why that's when I went back to\nWhat was your idea to to learn your part while sitting in the church\nWhile I was just suddenly on location and I was like what okay how one day one is Monday and I have is going to go to the church and learn life seems um [noise] it's funny because that clip to quite a long scenes so that was sort of seeing we film for all all day long and uh\nI Believe our first set up was probably some kind of wider let me some kind of master shot and uh\nI I slapped Daniel as you said in the towards the on the scene and\nI think we were supposed to once we get that part just stop you know because what we're going to be doing this all day and\nAnd I remember ah the first take forgetting and just slapping him many times and as soon as we cut I remembered that I was supposed to stop and I went oh God um and I think I'd ...
