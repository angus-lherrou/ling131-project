campaign were based on his image as a brilliant dealmaker and self made billionaire but recent New York times reporting reveals a different narrative it's\nBased on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages\nEuchre and self made billionaire but recent New York times reporting reveals a different narrative it's based on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years\nDonald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as much of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my guess or outright fraud\nSuzanne crowded and David Barstow are two of the reporters at the New York times who wrote a long investigative article about the many tax maneuvers Fred Trump devised to passes vast fortunes onto his children\nSo then crank writes about the intersection of politics money and government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes in\nResponse to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president nor his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSo then crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of Fred from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak [noise]\nFor Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York [noise] the strategy was the guy who build and sold his first home before you reach the age of twenty\nBy the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties she was really one of the biggest developers are true to move the country and ... them was building middle class homes which she built in his apartment buildings which was built him\nYeah I'd be things build up right they they're like these layers right and reporters come along and they\nAre assigned to do some story about Donald Trump and they go look at the clubs for a look at what's been written about before and it all kind of accumulates into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his\nTelling his story the famous line that he is always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father had to pay back with interest than if he parlay that million dollar loan\nInto ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father a tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engaged incest backpack schemes as he reaped riches friend whose father after we take a short break this is

[noise]\nSubject [noise]\nTonight at ...\nThis is fresh air and if you're just\nAnd I did that in ...\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter Suzanne crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged and suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how is the self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager [noise]\nOkay so in addition to some of the attack schemes we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws [noise]\nUh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quick two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw but I think what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise] um\nWe were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to dad and his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nThose Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then all being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump\nAnd then off being off to the races [noise] these were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nHe use the money for\nMany of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to just father is very crucial times\nFor more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nBut also see that when his cell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is the time\nAnd to be in the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump has incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd for a Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money and it's very intimate million dollars' worth of it was ... and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see and Donald Trump at this period\nHas a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and do well and it was caught us all to the will is taken to fret Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety and for Trump immediately sees\nThis caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he make the call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and a new caught us all within months has dropped\nYou know he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and a new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mariano Trump\nIn charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new Willis dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life were toward the end of ... life Donald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out\nAnd Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had help with so much money over so many years\nWe know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt to Bush's um to gain complete control over his state and potentially to use\nEmpire that for Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that empire as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nI guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after our break we'll talk about

eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nThis is fresh\nAir let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters Suzanne crack and David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published a long investigative article this month about ... schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire\nRuss Buettner published a long investigative article this month about ... use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump measured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nThen after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why to Donald Trump make that decision [noise]\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that for a Trump very much wanted this empire\nTo stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why he sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell and quickly assembled a private sale to develop for in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the buildings that were sold all of those buildings had ... ... own at that time of his death I'll get it off to include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to their children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much his ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four or to a New York development ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that that empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that Donald Trump made\nIt definitely wasn't just the Trump family was involved with\nMuch laugh so it wasn't like the deal out of the century that town and Donald Trump may\nIt definitely wasn't so veterans family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS [noise]\nYou know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of their tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this return them for a million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the mean time\nWas families who you know wealthy families should hire the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated\nManeuvers to to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or\nThey're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at gift in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments and deals\nOn public [noise]\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David [noise] harder to come back [laughter] go for it [noise]\nWell said he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nIt's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse and fruit shows grit and determination and Wylie\nLingo shaving skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when they actually took possession of one quarter of his father's real estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story\nSo at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly with the moment when he's just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money that happened in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for [noise]\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the math of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and has great negotiating deal making abilities [noise]\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward the math\nInteresting when I think about that I think you have to sort of [noise] I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stopped\nThat and I think that we've reset dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think that how careful we work\nWhat they want to believe what I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and are documented it was and\nThe Times' decision to put so many of those documents off I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true and the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents with the Trump family themselves um but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nPeople for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\n[laughter] so you spend a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room\nAnd the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on this story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access new or locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it allowed because [laughter]\nWe uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter]\nBut we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um with ah yeah that's
