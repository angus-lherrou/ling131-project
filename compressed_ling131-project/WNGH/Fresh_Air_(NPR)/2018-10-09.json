from an Israeli company to create fake online identities and use social media manipulation to help defeat Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination in the primary and Hillary Clinton and the general election\nThe proposals were apparently never acted on but we know that Russian operatives made effective used Facebook and Twitter and seeking to influence the twenty sixteen presidential

that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in his book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming the military offensive is was the German invasion of France whatever [noise]\nSo you have this new technology that are conducted\nEverything from tanks to airplanes

process with a couple of different companies that are doing this piecemeal but it's the stated intent of the Chinese Communist party that this will be a unitary score in place for every Chinese internet user of which there about eight hundred million by the year twenty twenty\nWell the other fascinating story you tell about China is they realize how commentary on social media can affect opinion and so they have ... and a large army of people whose job it is to comment favorably on the government policies right that's right\nAnd it is a very large army started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the

the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what did they do so it\nWas actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject to virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign\nThe campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\n[laughter] that's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered\nThen among us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives at these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies of one side or another ten million and all in his first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and it's set a model that we're starting to see an all future conflicts and\nA limited military campaign but nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and it's set a model that we're starting to see a future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and ... out the ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nA centrally they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important than the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message for residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a how they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they've reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serving the cars and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of ...\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist and an online army and get new what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in\nTaylor Swiss army of swift these\nYou can list in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one poll from the world it crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example ah you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research and this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou report rebel on your head you would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of hijacking one discussion\nTo drive it to your own ends the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army which trying hijacked discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air Dave Davies recorded with Peter Singer and Emerson Britain authors of the new book like war the weaponization of social media\nThat talked about social

council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of [noise]\nThey must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\n[noise] if you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and it was in a certain way\nYou had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military were using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nThey wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you add the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies to something that for example Russia's specialized in\nOf disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again and again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is and the like\nAnd the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative be buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a tablet should learn about history Wikimedia so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go on to what ... very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where I he used the term I'm In is a high school yearbook it was sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no it's not a sexual term is about drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week a PDF to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of those figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks as part of this larger ah area of research that people will talk about is essentially artificial intelligence or using machines to not just\nLarge or a ... area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence or using machines to not just ... but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking\nAnd so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can\nCreate a wonderful imagery and seen images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized\nAnd so those very same I ... for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies in turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks online where a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to a I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so so these neural networks like so I could be good at subtly detecting water robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden offering some you know profane\nOf committed something\nGet real world example of this there have already been creations of speeches that a bronco Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can layer real and fake imagery together where for example it can be\nA block Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich oh by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take out and meld together to allow you to a an essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson broken ...
