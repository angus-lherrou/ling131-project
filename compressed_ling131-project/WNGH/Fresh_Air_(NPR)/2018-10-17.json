Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nOf course men was created by my gas ... Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe series satirized as Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement bow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that's a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics\nBow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom course in around\nBut when the season one of bull jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of a sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rochelle\n[noise] Nineteen Ninety seven situation\nComedy horsing around me or don't ABC Show looks young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agrees raised three human children was initially dismissed by critics as both and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled with America loan to air for nine seasons\nStar of horses around ... or ... ...\nIt is good to be here Charlie [laughter] okay Raphael by Blacksburg welcoming the fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nWe were we were you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with a surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode one the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak who such a mess and all that far Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose a plate and it was called by ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd so that transition was really exciting to me and the idea that people aren't necessarily going to know what this is going in and one thing we've really found is that\nIt is a very silly cartoon universe but it can also I think maybe because of that go to some very sincere dark a melancholy and even tragic places and that may be in a live action show some of the story beats would feel maudlin or saccharin or you know a misery corny\nBut because it's animated and it's like a horse and it's bright and colorful it just takes on a different feel and you can kind of sneak attack in the sadness and some funds surprising ways\nI like that sneak attack and sadness and says in some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as a kind of sadness I like the final version better [laughter]\nAnd and and jak as in such despair afterwards and feels so responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's so lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability well he's not actively\nKilling himself but he's allowing vote universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... but maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed and despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself [noise]\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five what you wrote if I'm an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her\nSo he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side and he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible thing\nTake her coffins at the side and he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both ... jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his ... and this is well or not as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously though hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans and early on the network had a note maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to launch for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Libya's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be the live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the horse to water be careful\nMoms have a way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced cliffhanger ... Olivia gone for good and\nOf course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility you had to hits like all the way home getting rides from Mr T. L. from the gas to stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not how to live you on the show\nYou can't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy to show it would be over and above all else the show\nTo keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in a round dumb or bad or unrealistic but there's nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't here looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that\nI'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early and that clip that um he envied our our ...\nThat um so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip that um he indeed are are fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\n[noise] well you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ed and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but is gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea that the question\nOf you know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far beyond that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven and how does that track with me\nWhere I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurt so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption and I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\n[noise] so in this era of the me too movement were so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the cigarettes are you you and the writers is we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the lead for\nSure but we forgive you were words as presented on the show are awards\nThat celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a a ... we forgive you award from I think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it\nFor time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger and it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is\nThat our industry is so quick to forgive these you're really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we're forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her\nIs use of of racial slurs and miss defies me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not\nYou know Louis C K uh did a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is work that those men can be doing\nTo better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is Rafi I'll buy Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bull jak horsemen after a break he'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season one\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new collection of Eleanor Roosevelt advice columns I'm Terry Gross and this

Blacksburg and he's the executive producer creator and show runner of the Netflix animated comedy tragedies Hayes a bow jak horsemen which is now being shown on reruns on Comedy Central\n[laughter] watching the series especially like after the eulogy episode\nI would've thought that you were a bitter men who had a very troubled childhood reading about you a little bit my impression is that was not so\nYour parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rent a Jewish bookstore or your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the U. S. um tell us a little bit about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hobby\nWhat kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob\nAnd it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um you know I even\nAfter a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were shipped 'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an end so we have the misfit toys go um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect between being told about anti Sam ... senators that my living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture [noise] a hundred\nIt felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live and sophisticated [laughter] now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me um but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening um especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew you hear the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nThere are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them\nWell I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards and so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAre you know if actually one of the Jews who control the media I\nGuess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke\nOr I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey set up because there's the ... and like I think yeah\nAnd I and I would say a couple of years it'll be like oh\nYeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\n[noise] so your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school\nYou have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in [noise]\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nBelieve it was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nKnow like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and I remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here watching the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be funny\nA friend and I remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that\nOh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect to this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a Saturday out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say those things so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\n[noise] I thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well I think\nThose things are related a little bit for me at least um well I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nSaid made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nWell TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene\nIt was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it's a funny situation I you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting into the story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[laughter] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central as his running bow jak which has Netflix theories none of Comedy Central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect ... like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their",
