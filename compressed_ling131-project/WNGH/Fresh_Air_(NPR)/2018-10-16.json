definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting leak that they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we're going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all this time no that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you do you have this thing but but you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward um you know as I get older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school some watch\nAnd this is a story of his childhood [noise]\n'til your grandparents sound like they were very loving toward you but that they had pretty graph personalities particularly your grandmother I Want you to describe how you draw your grandmother and how you draw your grandmother's cigarettes which are typically hanging from her lips\nHe is my grandparents loved me so much and you know despite all of the trauma that I was surrounded by their their love floated me through life and they're just about a decade gone now and I still very much feel that love and I very much keeps me afloat [noise]\nThe the word tricky people though you know um they drink quite a bit uh in fact they were\nThey were better when I was young then when my mother was young they they were my grandmother could at times be violently drunk um when she was younger I guess I could sum up my grandmother with this\nI'd come home from school\nAnd somebody wrong to me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go on their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time\nI was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties [laughter]\nI'm not going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you cursed but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise]\nUm they smoked two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of ah having places be non smoking [noise]\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane liked what an inconvenience to the point where she said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke [laughter]\nHe died of lung cancer you die from well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to 'em\nOn [laughter] any outlive your grandmother\nBy a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday or my wife's wedding shower was that Sunday\nFriend in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife should be over and and uh my ... my grandmother was hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom\nAnd you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her and it's oh gosh ... ... ... and we're just so lucky the host and explode\nYeah still getting your grandparents were different people and they were raising in the family they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and and I think a part of it was ah my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had from my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking it's taken a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young [noise]\nYou know had recurrent nightmare as as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare\n[noise] this recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze [noise]\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and yes there there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because\nFirst they were just on top of me and I I vividly remember those dreams and yes there there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know you were writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and makeup sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because when you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again [noise]\n... do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nHere grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of um didn't have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't the generation and so we certainly were the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know to stigmatize you seeing someone was talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWe when you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book I was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my bought his face turned just add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned [noise] and\nHe just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you've learned and and by that what he meant was mean that that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel\nThis is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise] this is how you have to think\nAnd so he as an as a as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading [noise]\nSo he really helped me realize that a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally and this and that moment and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and draw somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you had your own style and that you should develop that he did say that but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um [noise]\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know real one is just have your own style [laughter] donate you ignore everything about her [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family addiction is

I'm One of her house mates had oh deed on heroin\nAnd that to me was all I Need to know because she really was a chameleon she had this great boyfriend for so many years they were both clean and sober together but when he died and then she took care of my grandfather some and then he died and then she started hanging out with other people I just knew it was going to be a downward spiral and [noise]\nWhen I saw her at a book event of mine um she she had all of his track marks on the back of her hand on her arm and she she blamed on the dog jumping up on her but I just knew in my heart I knew and surely after my second child was born\nI this was December of two thousand and eleven she started getting arrested again and so in January of two thousand twelve\nHolly who is who she is my ... by lineage but my sister or by heart and soul called me on the phone and she said did you see the paper today\nI live in North Hampton I live in our in western no agency the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies\nAnd I went in person to talk to my mother had of her court date and she she has she assured me that she was not using

make extra money and I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here [noise]\nAnd I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know I I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children [noise]\nAnd uh and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested um and then get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer try to pull her over and she would try to outrun them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again or the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will\nAnd you know you do ... I Would worry I wake up in the middle of the night thinking what if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people [noise]\nJust she wasn't making herself accessible to me [noise]\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long and at a trial process from really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was her it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already it on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right [noise]\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family [noise] and on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's a pig and he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise] and and I really had the feeling of\nYou know she's going to be cremated but I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home [laughter]\nMore time and and the funeral director pointed at like ... you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home [noise]\nSo I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that you would wear the dress she wore to to my wedding and so I had my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open a closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was response or you know we later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex um and I certainly would be living with you till later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks her shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute\nAnd I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom and make my mum beautiful again that I entered the house [noise]\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find\nCouldn't find the dress tonight my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits and then all the all of her drug paraphernalia\nAnswer her boyfriend at the time said oh you know what there's a there's the cedar closet and this other ... right yeah of course I'd trust that was that important to her she would preserve and the cedar closet\nI stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is [noise] and on a little nicer than I saw him on and on the lazy boy there I saw three handguns in next so that was to hand guns [noise] and now I'm realizing I'm In a room filled with handguns with my back\nTo someone who is high on heroin and I said this is exactly why I didn't come to visit my mom and the last two years because this is exactly what I figured I'd step into so now I'm thinking what if I'd done\nWhat if I die here my children need me\nSo I I made the boyfriend like I just need to be alone with my mother's things could you just give me a moment so he he moved and you know as loud as I could I said well Steve and you know the\nThe dresses and here I'm just gonna go to Macy's and uh by her address me and he just looked at me and he's like you sure we can keep looking at the conference because we can
