and Dave Davies in for Terry Gross last year the NC double a college basketball tournament known as March Madness was seen by Ninety seven million TV viewers [noise]\nOur guest writer Michael ... says the money and recognition the sport generates has led to a host of corrupt practices in the recruitment of players for the top college basketball programs talented athletes as young as twelve for targeted for manipulation by St agents ... describes as dealers in human athletic flash [noise]\nMany of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville is legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to soccer club yesterday when the jury and the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generates\nBillions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it but directly to the universities and to the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites and all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and we're just want to go [noise]\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year the rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches makers\nFour hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches make as much as a half million dollars a year all throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nLas Vegas hosts some of the biggest grassroots tournaments so in July you will have\nA couple of hundred teams all age groups and a thousand or more pliers a couple of hundred\nCollege coaches and they're playing in gyms all over Los Vegas some of them are staying on the strip and they're being scout at not only by coaches not only by college coaches but also by\nThese characters who exist on the fringes I think of it almost like boxing back in the day these sort of Damon Runyon ask characters who are they're just sort of see what's in it for them and the one hand there can be seen as colorful but also just like boxing back in the day\nThey're exploited their dealers in human athletic flash and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college Ken I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nOr their kids to when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business [noise]\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business\nThe Thirteen years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air [noise]\nWhat if you hit that bump in the night [noise] that sounds almost like [noise]\nTo electrify Halloween seems continue booth nine creepy crawly\nReal stories the paranormal non\nCatch a little Halloween Night it on TV [noise]\n\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nAnd a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to [noise]\nDo you write that on the college end of this is the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid [noise]\nSystem college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing their head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas and elsewhere but the assistant coaches that's\nTheir job get me kids thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach who say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want\nBut is that many that had coaches say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back into business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat\nIs extreme [laughter] I have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities\nAssistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\nBut in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there [noise]\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes\nFrom these runners or go between ...\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[laughter] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you manage to have ... in some way or another I get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you and NBA\nPlayer over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more\nSo if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you were quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting\nAnd judging the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you do you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars\nIf I were a future NBA player or with a family of a future NBA player I don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded there are specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and\nA lot of the players want to deal with known quantities and\nPart of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go between set you up with a with players Michael\n... new book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nAfter a break he'll talk about some earlier scandals involving Pitino and whether college basketball players should be paid also Justin Chang would use the new fantasy thriller so superior I'm Dave Davies Memphis is fresh air

amateur players and Louisville actually lost its two thousand Thirteen national title over strep brigade so that was sort of and that was sort of strike one strike to end this recruiting scandal\nUm and Pitino was not charged\nUm but it involved staff members and involved a recruit involve Louisville\nThat was a central thread in the FBI and Justice Department case\n[laughter] and in the ... case we're talking about high school recruits coming to Louisville coming to a dorm where there were sexual things going on\nUm what did Pitino say about it [noise]\n... Keno who's written a couple of leadership books but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees of sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and and there was an echo of this and the recruiting scandal he says I tell everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I\nAll everyone to follow the rules\nSometimes they don't follow the rules and when they don't follow the rules they don't tell me about it because they know how angry I Would be so\n... and in this recruiting scandal that where people just one layer below him his assistant coaches or in one case is director of basketball operations who were elbows deep in wrongdoing it would seem and Pitino\nDoes not take responsibility for either hiring the wrong people or for hiring people who don't listen to what he says and right now coach Geno has a

Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal [noise] when these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news at work\nIt was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal when these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news that war people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on [noise]\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces\nTo what many people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at present time that was a shock\n[noise] and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others [noise]\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball [noise]\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but\nThe fact that coach K set it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nDetermination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything [noise]\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports playing what you mean\nBecause sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars and it doesn't pay and then there's certain\nWhat college sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and then there's certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe one of the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their\nTheir responsibility is to their teen first\nWhich takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week and you're not paying them you know you were you were having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a ... in the midst of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's\nThe athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for [noise]\nWant to come back to one thing you said earlier you said a lot of people knew that the ... things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions\nDo you think that'll make a difference in the future I Do think it will make\nSome difference but I think the difference will be adjusted in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful\nSunny the Cairo the former Nike executive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me\nThese people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also sent by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone\nSo there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is\nThe it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that oh this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on that case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we cover this I mean ... you said that in some respects apparel companies look pretty bad and is what do they say about their role in in college for equipment in these charges the apparel\nCompanies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet there is a Adidas executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who ... executive his father was a high school coach\nHe's an insider he's a basketball inside or almost all of these defendants are well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity\nAnd Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they are planning on much to change either if they can help it", "year": "2018",
