someone she knows behind a closed door and the men denies it that's an issue of universities have been grappling with\nMy guest Vanessa ... is the author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus over the course of three years she interviewed a hundred twenty students from twenty universities spoke with nearly eighty administrators and experts and dozens of case reports\nShe says that while writing the book she witnessed a historic moment when survivors move from the shadows to the spotlight first on campus and then nationwide with me too movement\nGoogle Riyadh as as a contributing editor at the New York times magazine in Vanity Fair and has won a national magazine award\nVanessa ... welcome to fresh air you know you write in your book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it's spread beyond campuses\nWhat Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread\nI guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators and the Judiciary Committee had gone to college campuses [noise] what do you think some of the things are they would have been told about ... what did you take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by us the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault\nYeah it's so senators had I'm Ben on college campuses as presidents or administrators are title nine officers they would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is the very few women make it up\nVery few women are excited to get there and report and feel like this is their moment in the limelight something like not\nFew women are excited to get there and report and feel like this is their moment in the limelight\nSomething like not having reported for many years is not a big deal most sexual assault survivors don't actually report for awhile\nAnd she was prevented from leaving [noise] um so as Betsy devised trying to say title nine ... which mandates against gender discrimination on campus needs to be applied to discrimination against men because so many men are being wrongfully accused as that her case that is exactly what you're saying yeah [noise]\nShe's interested in this idea of gender discrimination claims both ways\n[laughter] so um have her guidelines taken effect yet\nNo they haven't they were leaked to the New York times on there will be a notice on comment period a you know we have to see also if she's going to put these out these were draft that the times got their hands on\nMy guest is Vanessa ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nYou think you're in control you bake you have the final say but what if you discover who just living in someone else's world [noise]\n[noise] I'm a mixed message [noise]\nReal government who really in charge of snap judgment thoughts on the beach [noise]\nAnd I just got an on G. P. B. [noise]\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with ... ... is author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault and the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nA huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students had to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault but maybe it has to be penetration\nBy the end of the three years that idea was completely blown up water 'em\nAnd I even had students say to me you know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a brass on people in speech and\nMake them feel like just as a like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we do have a national definition [laughter] so\nUm you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nThere is a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to talk to somebody now yes you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be\nUm they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes etcetera\nAnd from looking at this and researching it I\nDidn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question\nPeople as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time\nSo why were you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind [noise]\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sexes something ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are\nHaving sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of a\n... part of the charge but\nAnd I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but\nI Do think that the question is not that big a deal I'm into an axe we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you write that the strongest argument for affirmative can sound for yes means yes is it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness wanting me [noise]\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that\nGirls don't always saying no\nThey certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time uh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nYou know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever\nA lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever\nUm but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances and you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little dorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may\nRecently you know guys tried to come up and dance with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said it okay if I put my arm around here and I said\nI Know his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent and I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nThe first time that happened here\nThat was definitely a first time in fact it up for it to me I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I Know interest in him Mary and\nI'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so I think that's a great thing to how that happened and to have young girls who\nTruly a you know art in night clubs or at dance parties law understand like this is my buddy I own at people have to ask

you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nWhile it's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is empowering or is this denigrating 'em and\nYou know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism I in my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self object vacation isn't that just a\nA ruse isn't that just somewhere justifying\nOn this kind of way that you're you're presenting yourself but\nAfter speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up you know these kids I interviewed in college just graduating now Brittany spears was like\nIt they were they were just tiny when\nYou know these kids that I interviewed in college just graduating now you know Brittany spears was like\nIt they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up even growing up around pornography around fashion and that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with\nSo they don't have the same\nIdeas about oh if I trust this way it makes me look like a slug because this is the way people dress and now there's such a casual way and you're right and a lot of concerts as of beyond say or\nKaty Perry ... the you know it's it's crossing the line wave from scanty to something makes family sexual but this is what they believe is empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nA huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguised won't like their social media posts et cetera so there's there's a flipside to that\nBut they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves see reading your book we're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom\nAn area where feminism has previously not been able to reach so attached to explain what you mean by that\nI think that is raising of demons that has been going on with me to era is allowing women not only to save these are the things that happened to me in the past that I might call sexual assault or I might just called things I was extremely uncomfortable with and now going\nInto the future I Want to be treated differently in the bedroom I Want to be asked what I Want I Want to be able to say no tonight and have that actually be heard I think that they have are always kind of lives behind attitude shift we're definitely in the other two shifts now\nBut I truly believe that that kind of most private act is beginning to shift\nBut never go Riyadh is thank you so much for talking with
