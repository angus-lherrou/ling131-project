the American Academy of arts and letters metal for spoken language which is a pretty big deal\nAnd congratulations on that and I don't so much yeah so there's another section of the book I Want you to read and there's also has to do with your boyfriend hue and\nYou're this essay opens with you both having dinner after having been together for I don't know\nWith your boyfriend hue and\nYou're this essay opens with you both having dinner after having been together for about twenty two years or something you're eating dinner spaghetti and sausage that Hugh cooked and you've chosen this time to ask him how many men he slept with before becoming a couple of with you\n[noise] thirty five thirty six [laughter] every man ticked off on his fingers were someone I'd been compared to what one point or another not overtly he's anything but cruel but surely it happened someone kissed better than I did someone had more stamina Morse adoptive voice bigger muscles\n[laughter] I'm confident enough to compete against a dozen of his axis but he was moving on to the population of a small town thirty eight thirty nine\n[laughter] by what miracle had neither of us contracted aids how would we got no way I don't just mean later when people knew to be safe but back in the days when I didn't have a name and no one understood how it spread\nOne of the men he would live with a professor he had his first year of college had died of it in the late eighties and surely there were others on both my side and his yet for some reason we just skate had prospered even\nNow here we were the shadows lengthening our spaghetti growing cold as he hit the half hundred marked than lively sailed beyond it\n[noise] or [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nUm how are you at dealing with jealousy [noise]\nHow might dealing with jealousy I don't think I'm more jealous than the average person or that said I I Would rather than any other emotion I Would rather deal with any other one than jealousy\nBut that's a really great thing about whew is that she went on both value fidelity equally\nUm it's important to both of us so we that's something we don't have to worry about like I've never had to be jealous of another with another guy I have never never had to worry about that or he with me\nAnd it just takes a lot of your mind I think I mean you know every gay couple I Know has some kind of an arrangement you know like they're they can have sex with another person but they both have to be in on it or they can have sex with other people when they're on vacation\nThey're they can have sex with another person but they both have to be in on it or they can have sex with other people when they're on vacation but they have to tell each other everything or they don't say that has to be complete secret and they don't\nAnd it's the only seem so complicated to me right like it's all I could do to just have one boyfriend I I really can't could never imagine I don't know the energy it would take to have two or three at the same time um and I don't know I just I never I never wanted that\nDo you think that the AIDS epidemic figured it all into your [noise]\nYour interest in having a monogamous relationship [noise]\nNo I always wanted it but when aids came along it seem more important to me to not it seemed more important to me to find somebody who thought the way that I did\nAnd again I don't see anything wrong with people\nWhatever arrangement they want to to uh make for themselves I don't see anything wrong with that but\nI think the important thing is to find somebody because if you're if you're with somebody and they say well I think we should have sex with other people and you don't feel that way then it's really diminishing too you write to kind of go along with that when I Do not in your heart [laughter] I think\nIt really chips away you as a person so I think the important things to find somebody who wants the same thing but it was like what Chris Rock said about um you know he's one of those people that you have to get them if you're going to quote him you have to quote him exactly or you're doing a disservice [noise]\nBut it was something along the lines of a man's fidelity is is is in direct correlation how many opportunity she has right if if people are throwing themselves you know it's a lot harder\nTo strength comes into into it right you have to be a strong person to resist them but if no one's throwing themselves at you then it's not that hard\nNo but that's the thing you're the one who's out there and the relationship\nYou're the one who's goes on tour who's on stage who signs of ... million books um every year and you know there's a lot of people who idolize you and others I Would guess that there's a lot of people who would love to\nHave a relationship with you while you're passing through their town actually no [laughter]\nOne person and all the one person has as\nI Know one person and all the one person who has has a a proposition me one and maybe it's because I'm very public about\nBeing with you mhm so so it's I I'm not a person who's out there and saying well words are are you know ... reading about being single and being on the hunt for people\nAnd Hugh is you know it's not my idea that he was handsome Hugh is Josh handsome everybody says he always Hansen there's no not opinion it's it's just a fact right but he doesn't know it say\nAnd and and that's what you want you want somebody who's handsome but doesn't know it [laughter] and then whew is just so Mm [noise]\nI don't know he's just a real stand up person so I Know when people have thrown themselves at hue he just he just runs you know\nAny runs you know\nBack to me uh [noise] and so I've been very fortunate that way but we don't have to\nI mean sometimes in in a dream I'll have sex with somebody else and then even in my dream I think oh no I'm not going to have to tell you I Can't keep it a secret from them more relationships over and I'm asleep I Can't even cheat on you [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "01"}
