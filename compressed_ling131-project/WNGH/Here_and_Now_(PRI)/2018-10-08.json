billionaires Muslims a movie star and increasingly feminists according to lead to Hong Fincher feminism is having a moment in China and that is deeply frightening to the Chinese government\nVenture is author of the book betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China she says she hasn't seen a social movement this powerful since the Tiananmen Square protests of Nineteen eighty nine ... ...\n... thanks so much for having me here nice\nTo talk to you tell me first to focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women\nAre the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nRight so um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen\nFor planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handouts stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses but before they even carried out their plan\nThe police and and all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around at a rest\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry their resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what has to do well um well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because I'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something that charging them with and and and the end it was something\nI can too disturbing the social order um\nThat the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people and the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handouts stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you know handing out stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these ...\nDoing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film is fine\nUm well I mean among the feminists are quite a few of them um had suffered abuse in their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle um some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse\nAnd it and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement has personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence\nAnd that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back\nOne of the of some of his five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and China only need a bachelor's degree\nYou know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume that double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the and\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and the propaganda the rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do what ever men can do\nUm and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist hero because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as\nA market reforms um but but now in the last couple of\nDecades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm\nWith the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially and so many ways and that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThat dissatisfaction with with this huge gender gap that women you know have to put themselves behind men and and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair\nWhat what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically\nSo the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of\nWhat I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the well I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long\nThen their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media that women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant um they should seize on their so called best child\nWhich is a official Chinese state media that women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant um they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies\nUm so the the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push 'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population\nThe birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women\n[noise]\nMORNING EDITION and on second thought to political rewind\nAll things considered split their support makes everything you hear a beep beep beep off if we didn't hear

um private school has used his eyes I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller\nSo should um give it up we both love comic books and we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help\nHe is of mixed heritage his dad his Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um ... is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in

you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was in the ... face right All right yeah so ... yeah and a half century anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who his son to his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm going to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him an allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be\nUm the poster boy for international politics right [laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to did you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where\nWhen nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared I didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating\nA Japanese person to a Korean person where so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of\nIt before you called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well yeah what's the difference between polite and ... where he says I think most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism\nBut there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone so how does speech on in the book realized that to understand I think he\nSomething that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of others someone\nSo how does beach on in the book realized that understand I\nThink he's he's had to deal with sort of it's in for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been\nAs viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his fear and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know up or yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have them have a pretty rich in our life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because I Do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia like the character to just have an adventure or\nYou know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't white lady social person you don't want to be the ... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved\nBut I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time\nAnd it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes but for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time [noise]\nWhat do you what's the pay for you is it just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI

maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but I it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting bell hurt real people last\nIf you were in I mean this is the young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted a conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation [noise]\nI Would say what does it take to find one voice in prejudiced times\nHow can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see

Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides of the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there I mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis of the country of twenty eight billion people eight million people are being fed by the u._s.\nSo what did you see there I mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people eight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day\nIt's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and ... eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not a natural catastrophe it same man made a trauma that as a result of a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years I mean that neither side winning\nAnd they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes to the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east of the matter and the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who the who the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country\nI'm what's happened since then is that a Saudi led coalition with us support also UK all the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as a Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemeni control of the capital's ... on up Seventy percent of the\nCountry the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids being led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted the front lines of Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nGoes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of eight and commercial traffic is getting through\nUm what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between the who the and the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who these\nOther than the other side from the Saudis the U.S in the u._k.\nExactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni versus Shia you also have a split of trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is that this is a humanitarian catastrophe\nOr the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death but at the same time there was a political emergency too because the only sign that he's gaining from\nUnder the children literally starving to death\nBut at the same time there was a political emergency too because the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate on the extremist of al Qaida and ISIS and it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian melt down but political melt down I'm going to tell you what does that mean it means that\nThe humanitarian meltdown is the three and a half million people on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen or there was a few to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the calls you can see a half a mile cues at\nGas stations on the road\nYou've got teachers and doctors and nurses are not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself at the moment as being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the signs are waging it but in fact being exploited by extremists and I think that the onus on the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S on the u._k.\nIs to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire\nA winning a whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition settled on\nRight there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. to us and the others want what's their goal\nThat goal is festival to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians\nSecondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand um fourteen or two and a third Leon importantly for Saudi Arabia\nThey want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no question about who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh\nThe costs that were being imposed a on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo says the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties that obviously sticks\nIn the ... because I met a ... who ... told me about missiles had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of schoolchildren mobile forty of them killed in August is extra state your in the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed a such a fine\nA coach of schoolchildren mobile forty of them killed in August is extra state your in the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed a certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians slightly I Know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed them Monday indirect\nEffects on far larger numbers\nThen why would the U.S not wanting to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not the primary ...\nI'm not costing any at home and I'm a judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians are not being a protect to them to come up to the war has breached the base of the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the side independent un\nInquiries have a ... produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a a crisis that now I came away saying that the world needs to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed but the pen needs to be picked up because there is no current debate to replace\nThe failed un ... resolution twenty Fifteen was something that is actually a roof map to peace rather than the ... for\n[noise] if we take the issue of 'em are refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington um you have said that regarding help from the western world\nThey moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country every year how does that affect\nWork we'll just for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today most of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh historically\nFor the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture often children the U.S has stepped up and being a leader and was called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees are you at the U.S actually on the Reagan Administration that was over two hundred thousand [noise]\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival\nIn the Reagan Administration was over two hundred thousand [noise]\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed the security vetting arrangements they want you to update them less legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce spy Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means that individual lives are affected that are off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported\nThe work of the U.S military and government in Iran translates into things\nAre being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who can't now starts a new life so we're in the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble they being targeted because of that support for the U.S they're not being allowed in\nUm\nThis fall we're counting on the participation of everyone who listens to cover the rising costs of programs we bring you an GB if we didn't hear from you during our fault fund drive there's still time to support the programs that make a difference in your life please take a moment now to make an online contribution good at gp dot org and click donate at the top of the page\nYour contribution at whatever level is right for you will help cover the cost of the programs you love on cheap ...\nThank you so much for your support of Georgia Public broadcasting\n[noise] one of the most important is your job actually ... you know the\nEarly voting charges on our on ... and you begin to for your choices and rewind Pamela insiders will be here for four days a week to help guide you through races from the top of the ballot down to the bottom of the\nTo join me in our panels or do you do for the latest election news\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

Vermeer and many since the highest there have been no arrests and not a piece of stolen art has been recovered WB you are in the Boston Globe was launched a podcast called last seen to investigate how and why that's the case\nHere where reporters jak word leaked\nIn the early hours of march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety the city of Boston was still celebrating saint Patrick's Day hangovers would be widespread come daybreak so would news at the city's most unusual museum had been the victim of a daring overnight robbery [noise]\nPainting I'm Casey Kaufman and here's what's happening up priceless collection of artwork was stolen early this morning from Boston Isabella Gardner Museum\nThere was one AM Saturday the two men posing as uniformed policeman ... security guard's here I mean to be investigating a disturbance\nInitial estimates put the value of the selling work that at least\nTwo hundred million dollars ...\nMillion dollar eighty seven year old Gardner Museum is considered one of the finest small art museums in the country\nOfficials say the museums elaborate surveillance system made no difference\nEasy andme officials today that it went the largest are tied in history\nDespite the confidence of museum officials that the prejudice artworks will be recovered experts say they could disappear for years perhaps for ever read was TV for eyewitness news\nThe

the Gardner Museum\nThere'd been a keg party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible\nMaybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief after all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so we ... them into the museum\nThat guide ...\nThey came in and they turn so I could see that I could see that they had half goes bad as they look like up so I thought so the rest of the way\nThese Christian ... talked about that night at an Indian restaurant in two thousand Thirteen\nThe first question was is that anybody who I said my partner to go down\nIn the first time that former guard the line who was on duty that night without it\nHas ever spoken publicly about his experience\nThey're wondering if they might just\nCome up behind my head with a gun or the silence or and just you know do a real quickly\nIt was terrifying night and all these years later he still rather we not use his full name his first name now is Randy\nIn Nineteen Ninety Randy had a passion for symphonic music the moody blues and the trombone he still plays makes a living at it mostly in house bans on cruise ships but back then Randy had recently earned a master's in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing to supplement the income mixture of the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and for were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nFeel at nighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read I could bring my own and in practice\nI was always happy to say yes to filling I'm\nDoesn't recall any special training are specific instructions for the night shift\nI was always happy to say yes to filling I'm\nRandy doesn't recall any special training are specific instructions for the night shift beyond the requirement to register his presence in each of the galleries\nOn all the forest during his rounds he did that by swiping a magnetic strap\nHe wasn't originally on the schedule to work the night after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reported they called in sick addict had told him about the carriage hats alarm but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to add to watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police fire immediately made that connection oh this might have something to do with that alarm that went off\nOne of the uniformed man said he recognized and asked to id\nYou said yeah I Do know you\nThere's a warrant out for your wrist\nAnd he told her it to stand against the wall\nAnd put his arms up he does the pat down\nIt puts the cops on\nAnd on just standing there with my job and\nThrowing while you know what was going on where the written due to see really in some kind of trouble and [noise]\nIt's still never occurred to me that they were anything but policemen\nBy stepping out in a way from the deck and make and it's also stepped away from the still means signaling traveled to the outside world to museums panic button no sooner with Abbott against the wall and handcuffed than Randy was too\nI kept asking him over and over why are we being arrested why are we being arrested and he wouldn't answer\nSo cups or on\nMy hands are behind my back and then duct tape starts going\nOn around my eyes so about the time that he begins putting the duct tape on he says this is a robbery\nAnd so then everything was fine like crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise]\nNone of it made any sense and then suddenly made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why the law was going to your mind when suddenly duct tape is going around your head and\nAnd I'm worried for my life [noise]\nUm but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them\nSaying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some relief\nAnd I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid\nSaying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some relief\nAnd I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid go along with whatever they there's nothing here in this museum that is worth my life [noise]\nMisty find duct tape around Mandy an avid had from ten discount\nAcross their eyes and across their mouths but only a split that they could breed than stare stare the robbers led the guard you couldn't see anything down to the basement want it to the use and other parents handcuffed to attach Randy ... limestone think near a boiler\nRandy ... ... let's combine the two and weirdly courteous\nThe guy who kept me she was making sure that they weren't too tight on my wrist and he adjusted that several times and he said I you're going to be here for a long time so I don't want to be these to be too tight\nSo he was real calm and real nice about it and he also several times said sorry to have to do this\nRandy just one of the guy to get away from him to go do what he had come to do to get out of there were you panicking\nUm it was scary and I remember feeling like I needed to prepare myself for death if that if it ended up coming to that what does that mean preparing yourself for death\nWell I was running music through my head a lot just feeling like I don't know\nWhat happens to us when we die it's all in history but um [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "08"}
