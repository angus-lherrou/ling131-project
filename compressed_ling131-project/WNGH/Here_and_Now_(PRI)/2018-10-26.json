Red Sox play a game three of the world series in LA tonight and you can bet that wide I kids are going to be watching and dreaming of their own careers in the majors\nMany of those kids leaving the country that sends the most foreign born players to major league baseball the Dominican Republic baseball greats from one Marshalls too\nAnd major as many of those kids leaving the country that sends the most foreign born players to major league baseball the Dominican Republic baseball greats from one Marshalls to big Papi David Ortiz to Pedro Martinez\nTwenty years ago when Pedro Martinez was pitching for the red Sox he founded to charity to help young people in the Dominican Republic\nOne of those that help to go to college in Boston was an athlete named Catalina\nEventually she met Martinez and they got married\nNow ... runs the Pedro Martinez foundation the charity provides health care and nutrition for kids and the DR and it is building a charter school that'll teach young ballplayers job skills in case they never make it to the majors she says only three percent of kids recruited by the majors ever play on a team and that's a blow on many fronts\nA lot of our baseball players a lot of young prospects to not finish high school\nAnd then when they're released from any team and they want to go back into life\nThey don't know what to do so they can be signed by a team I mean the lucky ones will be signed ... you're saying they never actually may make it to the team exactly and they're probably incredibly talented too of course\nIt happened to my brothers they were top prospects one was for the New York Mets and the other one for the Seattle Mariners and we should say you come from a baseball family you're both your parents were players your mom and your dad and they started a\nLittle league and the ... that has gone on for thirty seven years now still operating correct okay so your brothers had high hopes yes they receive a really good signing bonuses both of them did\nBut they were among those Ninety seven percent that didn't make it one he was really prone to injuries and the other one he play in the majors but did not continue that was cut and no other factors so both of them were assigned at sixteen\nAnd they couldn't finish high school\nSo it has been painful sometimes to see them not being able to to find themselves in terms of life and okay so I was released and I'm I'm I'm twenty seven and now I'm twenty six I'm not going to go sit\nIn a classroom with high school kids I'm I'm always exposed to this type of situations because of what my parents do and because of who page raise and\nThey just became more clear to both of us that we needed to help players that have been released\nAnd they don't know how to go back to society to their lives what could you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers\nAnd they don't know how to go back to society to their lives what\nCould you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers or are you just trying to do a stopgap measure by helping out young people who may hope to go on to major league baseball but probably don't have that much of a chance so what\nWe're developing as curriculum that would have them be calm technicians in any than it has to do with sports and the marketplace that means Trish Ernest professional trainers\nMassage therapist positions that are related to the sports industry and they can go back\nAnd get a job either with another team an ... or maybe an amateur level but it's a way that they can go back into the sports world and make a living for them without being baseball players\nBut is it realistic given the amount of jobs that are on offer there that that would be the answer for for so many of the\nKids could be realistic and as American all thirty teams of ... will be have academies where they signed the players so there is a high demand all the time for work\nSo the world series is going on right now and one would think for young people in the DR that there are so many thing that's going to be me one day\nAnd do and Pedro when you go there and you go there are a lot find yourself having to say to young people you know I really hope so but probably not so have a plan B\nWe do it in a way that it doesn't kill the dream\nBut I'd grounds them what do you do when you say just exactly what you said that baseball is not everything\nThat there are other options in life yeah but then they see Pedro yes but then they see Ninety seven percent or fathers that did not make it and it's becoming more of a cautious conversation topic and the Dominican Republic about the difficulty\nOf becoming a baseball player and how it's not only enough for you to have your raw talent\nThere's so many other factors that go beyond your control even the fact if you find a coach and triple layer travel a that doesn't like you if he doesn't like you he's not going to give you play time period\nYou started out wanting to be a sports broadcaster you married to a sports star you are now in charge of this foundation that is clearly changing lives in the Dominican Republic something I imagine\nYou married to a sports star you are now in charge of this foundation that is clearly changing lives in the Dominican Republic something I imagine you couldn't have anticipated for you maybe you can sympathize the reward you get out of doing [noise]\nSo I see it as a domino effect\nI was helped at some point my institution\nNow I have a commitment to the kids and my country to do the same so I'm One but I represent five hundred kids or maybe a thousand I'm ready to two thousand\nAnd that other kid that I'm going to be helping or that two or three or four ... percent five hundred or one thousand or two thousand that's what it means to me\nI can help and other ... I can help another page or they can become professionals either through sports or arts and they can eventually also do the same that we are joined thank you Karen Lena Martinez thanks thank you\n...

have a go he lifts Saudi Arabia [noise] then we started to talk about this division so the Arabian\nOn day after day you know we've become like a friend say on the relationship between father around on some so more than just to college [noise] so uh [noise]\nYes on ... they were ... because he was writing his own journalist intuition to post so that's why spending billions to promote the picture\nFor him for his vision ... article with what's changed and all of a story so they were attacking them threatening him all the time so they would do the same with me but not the same level so I said once you know we wanted a girl by us to the the the\n... one of the guys that I have a an idea of\nCreating an army to combat being the organs drones\nI really liked the idea I said but he has a problem you know I have no gosh we have to get the Saudi activists phone number to activate their Twitter comes Henri cannot do that just so different numbers because then they're going to be a danger\nAre so different and said I'm going to get through five thousand American Dollar get some some ... given the activists the numbers that day\nSo you would buy these sim cards with Canadian and American phone numbers give them to people in Saudi Arabia so that they would be harder to trace again and then they could come back the pro Saudi trolls as you called them on line with their own information campaign\nYes but we ask them you know we we had our policies you know you've got to use very bad language you cannot Britain someone who cannot\nBe a supporter of ... or ... or something like that because we want to spread the clear message we're talking about freedom of speech was talking about human rights violation so we do not want to use the same language that they're using us you know against us\nWho are those people those pro Saudi or the employees are they commissioned\nHe was in a U.S you know against us\nWho are those people those pro Saudi or they employees are they commissioned by the crown prince NBS as he referred to him earlier how influential are they what are they doing\nSo here's the thing maybe people would find that strange but then Saudi Arabia we have no problem and so the only place where we can do with our ideas or opinions Twitter on people started to work against the government so they said let's create this army\nTo stop or to the ... the law could never at this this is what happened so now they're being so many people about two to three thousand dollar monthly and just to work and disarm\nThe Saudis are well aware of you and I want you to tell me about something that happened to you in Montreal in may when two men paid you visit they said that the crown prince had sent them\nAnd they asked you to go back to Saudi Arabia with them they asked you to go into the Saudi embassy in Ottawa for a new passport\nThe similarities to ... case are chilling\nHave you thought about that day [laughter] [noise]\nThey they sent to ... to me\nAnd they also ... brother with them and they said okay here's the thing we do have a message from the as they ... we really this is the new buyers your work and the what is your videos and he wants you to be back during the I said okay thank you but they can trust you\nYou didn't believe them you didn't trust them because you don't feel that as soon as you got back to Saudi Arabia what would happen\nWith the joke on let me kill [laughter] as their ... their plate so if I'm there they're going to kill me nobody knows did\nYou talk about that meeting with democracy ...\nYes I did and they told me that I can meet them in private they just made them in public places don't go to the embassy but he's the same when they give up they said you know what\nIt does have a ... about it so in the past where they said yes I said okay you just come with us for an hour to the embassy we're going to give you a new one [noise] you know and I want\nTo go with him on it and if you wanted to go I was

people like you are there dissidents around the world wondering whether or not they might be spirited off back to Saudi Arabia at any given time\n[noise] so first of all just they want to I Want to mention what I'm saying 'cause Jim ... he always said that you know\nI don't know if there is that the majority of the ... and just they want to mention that a bus or the government and they wanted to silence demise\nAnd now they're having dollars and Jemma everywhere they they they wanted to silence we just saw one guy and look what happened\nThe the ... media site to focus more on this and this started to focus more on the human rights violations in Saudi Arabia so they made the mistake a secret mission it's it's a big fan of the if\nIt's maybe but there's still a risk you have family back in Saudi Arabia and so ... I'm thinking of the pictures this week of his son shaking hands around friends in what an intimidating seen that from like what is it like for your family back at home\nOr if they do find brothers are jailed one of them they wouldn't came here a few months I go to jail because of you because I mean yes on the group of my friends also out of jail because of me and they said okay you want them to be released\nShut up I suppose that\nI don't know whether that sit on the line for the they killed them or I just I don't know\n[noise] but [noise] they showed that they were just mentioned are full of sellout is on the verge of a hostile genius that's it's killing me honestly it's one of the worst they share the newest thing my life [laughter] why is that it's [noise]\nServing Harlem and beyond his G.

from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame\nChip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joined just now in in ... you were on Easter Island in July when you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\n[noise] well it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane lock I knew it had headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a\nHead into French ... and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures in here and now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\n[laughter] well it's a beautiful place hum my research team which consists of\nA undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system\nAs small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out a there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles could um take their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being the the style in which was the largest one uh that remained what\nAre the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turned to the south and come to the main Hawaiian\nFor raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the ... area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turned to the north to some of the other ... ah there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low lying it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very strong\nChance of being intercepted by hurricane but of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes at northern Mary Alice island\nUh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour and um this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category\nA sense last year as hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking with the growth in hurricanes they're getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was a moved by the hurricane to the north and north east\nThe trade when waves may push that sand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed\nYou push that sand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on the ... sea level around two thousand years ago\nWe are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming the ... or don't exist\nThat ship fluctuate a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii face we're speaking with us yeah thank you\nAnd other conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent and the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work\nHe says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because the focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in rent and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searched shifting the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that's shipped about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less wrote it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do a nice pair comparison right we are very high growth rates in China we are very high growth eighth in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is\nA lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution on means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talk about is this\nAn academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change gets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much pots\nSo much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change gets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice what\nKind of movement I mean like when you give give me one thing okay so like it's not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money is going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nHot springs in the area where swept away by the ... and you're listening to here and now I'm\n\nI'm Charles ... and the president affairs council of Atlanta we put on programming here in Atlanta at the intersection where technology politics business in the world collide we underwrite would you be the number one because I Love\nIt and secondly because I think there's a huge overlap between your listeners and people are interested in the world\nI Love the GDP opens a window on the world\nTo find out more about becoming a corporate sponsor emails sponsorship at ... dot org\nWith a little more than a week to go until election day it appears the conduit for governor remains a toss up one of the factors that will shift the balance Ryan camps or ... ... as the race comes to a close political rewind insiders will be here to break\nDown every step of the Bush to the finish line and we'll look at what's happening in other races on the ballot for Congress and state wide offices joining us today [noise]\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and from your NPR station\n\nHunting for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

all along the guitar has been about interacting with other people it's never been\nI Know there's you know there's the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter the loan

mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself in here\nTo another level yeah I don't want to make it sound like that either it's because over the years it's\nBecome just another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play something alone and it was really just\nSo uncomfortable and\nIt was a drag and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get this together so\nA year later I tried it again and then I kept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually\nDo this and it started to feel like [noise] like music\nWell it seems like every time to talk about I think for\n\n\n\n\n\nFun like this what comes out or it sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the notes because you say it's a tribute to condition the platelets in your life and you're done usually it's just a\nMelody just a very simple you know what I'm saying I'm\nWriting it but then like one thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nCalled pretty stars and they made to shine and\nThat was something I quote unquote road signs that book and the album ... and then made the when I wrote it I recognize that it was a very very common\nCore when prior to the recording of this album I was laying at this club called the stone in New York and I was like some of the music that I Would record it played that song and a guy in the club one night he said oh I Love that was really great version of [noise]\nMusic that I Would record it played that song in\nA a guy in the club or whatnot you said oh I Love that was really great version of Jessie\nJ what what do you talk about I Know some just to play\nYou this recording and it was like oh my God that's the same ... same malady and then I checked it out and it\nWas like you know it's just an old traditional songs like I'd probably hurt the she used to treat you play it when I was five years old or something\nLike a money making them and I could be in trouble now but I think it's a you know it's like a public domain kind of thing and that there's so much music float around I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing or am I remembering it or what is it\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nOh\nI Love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want to listen to ...\n... ...\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one or that I played on the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen in the day the\nOther process so they're sort of a drone\nOne down\nWas originally from the guitar and then that's going on like a larger\nAuto pedal because\nAnd then I'm using that as the backdrop for\nJust one so low tar a\n...\n\n\n\n\nYou know I was trying to stay in the state of not being sure what was going to happen I mean as you're playing either ... yeah well the composing is you know happy now these are pieces\nThey never feel like they're finished anyway but what I Do to prepare for the album was actually played six night down your every night I brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither old compositions of mine or new ones and I tried to keep myself just off balance for that whole wheat\nAnd that's what I wanted to continue on into the studio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen\nI didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really know anything when I went in there\nYou know for somebody you're thinking of wood and your younger days hide behind your instrument that
