Boston and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nThis year and now the midterms are three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for predicts just tell us what will happen in politics and the economy and technology and another things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future\nThat's what will happen in politics and the economy and technology and in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future so how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of protection Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's gonna happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to our race that uncertainty and one way that we erase uncertainty is by turning to experts and saying please tell me what's going to happen next one\nThe experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasts as they always get things wrong yeah ... exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good\nAnd so many other domains [noise] is it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that [noise]\nUh and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise] um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate they are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen or once you think you know what's going to happen that will change\n... is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen and once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\n[noise] this is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make an accurate forecasts but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nAh there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nAnd one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to get me to straight goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory [noise]\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies where the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with population bomb by Paul Ehrlich was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mask global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um\nWell it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general those going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecasts and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong [noise] I can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news\nBut if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be\nIt's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as a person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know I said it was going to happen\n[laughter] yup and you know look it's a there's an old saying about the mutual funds you know you start\nFive hundred mutual funds and you just bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big and then you hold up your one or two that hit big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat St gardener who is author of the book future babble and coauthor of super forecasting the art and science of production Dan thank you so much for joining us thank you and let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise at here and now dot org\nNow to the environmental fall out from one of the most destructive fires in California history in late July the

Robinson stand up comedian writer actress co creator and co host of the pod cast a TV show to do planes and co host of the podcast so many white guys she has a new book titled everything's trash but it's OK join us for shares\nThis afternoon at three and she'd be energy being news dot org\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and college fine where consultants work with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards Moritz College find dot com\nIt's here and now and now look at some of the latest technology for the blind and the vision impaired with our friend and go to guy Brian Charles and director of technology at the ... Center for the blind\nAnd bringing all sorts of things spread out here in the studio and I were making a video so people can see this for their loved ones were posted it here now dot org but would you like to start [laughter]\nGoing to start with the simplest of tests\nOh and I were making a video so people can see this for their loved ones were posted it here now that lord what would you like to start\nI'm going to start with the simplest of technologies one that has a lot of impact on blind or visually impaired people and that is our ability to pick the right medicine at the right time he had a medicine medicine bottles here and attached to its side is a little digital recorder now there's kind of a comical a recording on here\nHer hand Lincoln [noise] ...\nWow what a timely thing\nInstead of having to put rubber bands on to indicate whether or not this is a once a day or twice a day or three times a day mad I can rely on this kind of labeling\nThat is amazing and at first of all who knew that Abraham Lincoln ... yeah\nYeah for Xanax [laughter] now is this is one example of two or three different companies out there the one that I tend to get my medications from is a mail order place\nBut I can also get this from just down the street at the local pharmacy so that's that is now a lot of people these days are having to deal with diabetes\nAs in mine and therefore you have to take your blood sugar on a regular basis you tested so I've just taken the test strip out and I'm going to slated into my glucose monitor\n[noise] she's just acknowledge him make than actually going to tell me [noise] please apply blood to protest trip so I could uh put my finger put the blood on there and that will tell me my blood sugar\nAnd it keeps track of it over time you have I had it keeps track of it over time so that when I go to see my physician they can download the data from now also in my little bag over here um I Love the kitchen in my household it's my favorite Rome I Love to cook\nAnd so I'm forever looking for gadgets that will make my life easier so in my kitchen ever talking microwave oven I have a talking kitchen scale so that when I'm baking that can measure by weight rather than by volume those kinds of things you can also have been talking for monitor\nLike this one because among other things pushing the button a couple of times [noise]\n\nThis I can switch from Fahrenheit disintegrate and it can take very high temperatures and not taken out of my bag\n[noise]\nThis I can switch from Fahrenheit disintegrate and it can take very high temperatures and not taken out of my bag a\nThey're called a ... part of the echo family and in my household we have a a big echo in the living room and a little dots here and there throughout the house\nLet's be honest buying a I don't like your wife to hear this but you do refer to this as your new girl than\nIt is yes go is definitely my new girlfriend the fact of the matter is that she wakes me up in the morning she sings me to sleep at night sounds like a girlfriend ...\nWhat what what is life like there's so many more devices when you see them but I'm just wondering what life is like in your house\nWith these ... it's just as a revolution for you but I'm also thinking that there's just got to be voices going all the time you're talking to Alexa and asking her to turn a light on or off it turn you know the radio on or off or you know testing your blood or it just it feels like there's a Greek chorus fire you know there's\nA lot of chatter that goes on in the house no doubt I'm very lucky that I Know braille so I'm a portion of my access to information comes back to leave so nobody gets to what's going on\nBut one of the absolute phenomenon in my household is I get out of bed first head to the bathroom I turn on the shower the sink flush the toilet and step on to my talking scale 'cause I don't want the rest of the household here\nWith the bad news or the morning is from that talking scale\nSo we learned a mascot we control volume and with the new eco family only the one closest to you responds so you don't have this problem or saying something down the hallway only have it change something in the living room yeah that kind of thank God\nI mentioned braille a moment ago some braille\nHaven't been around that long a just a couple of hundred years and it still under development ah we recently adopted an international standard for English Braille because they're the Brits wrote braille differently than the Americans than the Australians [noise]\nBut the big change in braille is what's called refresh will break I'm going to turn on this orbit reader mhm\nIt looks like a hand held labeled printer [noise] what's it doing\nDots electro mechanical dots are raising up in the pattern of braille characters now um\n[noise] what's it doing little dots electro mechanical dots are raising up in the pattern of braille characters now a couple of years ago I was showing you a refresher will braille display\nAnd you were astounded at the price of three thousand four thousand dollars for this one now costs five hundred oh wow so\nBraille is becoming more affordable than it's ever been before\nAnd now I'm going to turn to magnification ... the vast majority a blanket visually impaired people have usable vision\nSo out of those who are legally blind about eight out of ten\nHave some useful vision so we use closed circuit TV devices I'm going to\nTurn this one on ... looks like a very small TV you know didn't come on yet it gives me controls to\nShow things and magnification to increase the magnification decrease it changed the polarity of things in my view things better white on black than black on white defined I can switch that can also take a picture with it\nA at a distance bring it closer to my face and be able to control that magnification as well and if you do have a large TV in your living room you can attach this to that\nAnd use it screen but the device that's on your camera this on your device and really in large an image so grandparents ... with low vision can see pictures of their grandkids are so this makes it very portable for them to do that when I was flying we know you\nHave catch the bus that's an application that it can help you find bus stops or learn a rival departure time is blind square that to TPS application just like foursquare but I Want to see the device it helps you know the color\nOf your clothing time so the color identifier that are brought to show your last time cost three hundred and fifty dollars saying this one costs twenty six wow and this is maybe a tenth aside so that one has to take a call key fob exactly I'm going to hold it against my time [noise]\nJak orange that Jay dark red states [noise] ... [noise]\n\nNow I'm pointing it at my pants and they say\n[noise]\nVery dark brown that lying I'm wearing a looking glass\nNow I'm pointing it at my pants and they say very dark brown they lying I'm wearing a looking on the black pants oh All right and\nThat tells me guess what the batteries time oh when is it that far off\nWow so I Know manage my own parents with shirts with ties in my household something that I always had to rely on somebody else to do in the past I Want to see the classes that get help with so\nI'm going to take off my regular designers shades here and to put on a pair of glasses but they have a camera mounted just above the no no way [noise]\nSo I'm now going to take a phone it's specifically a over rice and phone that has only one purpose and that's to do what I'm about to do with it for I Am I ready for service and now if I double tap on the home button on this phone is calling in Iran agent\nTesting compassion ... says\n\nI Am David Moses director of public relations and communications for the west and Hilton Head island resort spa what makes the west and help that island resorting spots so spectacular but soon as you walk out from any one of our hotel rooms your feet\nAway from the Atlantic ocean and the pristine natural environs that on that island offers we underwrite with Georgia Public broadcasting because we believe in the high quality programming it delivers to find out more about becoming a corporate sponsor emails sponsorship GAPP gotta work\n[noise] one of the most important is your Joe ... is Eugene early voting charges on our\nI'm ... and you begin to from your choices political rewind handler insiders will be here for four days a week to help guide you through races from the top of the ballot down to the bottom of the ticket and then join me in our panel today you do for the latest elected you news\nHelp guide you through races from the top of the ballot down to the bottom of the tickets to join me and our panel today you do for the latest election news\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

hundred nine four seven auto\nIt's here and now back to President Trump's comments last night on sixty minutes continuing to question the importance of addressing climate change\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um [noise]\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nWell others are pushing forward in fact they're fighting there saying that fighting climate change can be job producing and that we're running out of time according to last week's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change there's just about a decade left to take unprecedented action to reduce to reduce the extreme impacts of climate change\nThe report recommends reducing current emission is being released into the atmosphere but also capturing the carbon dioxide that's already out there what's known as negative and missions so let's take a look with Gregory ... a professor of public affairs and environmental studies at the ... school of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin Madison\nProfessor technologies will be needed to do this but one of the easiest way the carbon dioxide out of the areas plant right because they just suck it out\nYeah so growing things so using photos synthesis to take the oath to the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of Syria to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing in all of these uh schemes to remove the uh to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one with planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with\nMhm and the biggest one with planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with and if it's if that's something else is growing food um that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields in the future\nAnd if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food and using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects of even things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because of scale has to be so large\nAnd then also we know that Kay trees only store ... for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\n[noise] yeah there's a permanent issue with a story in the the two in um injuries that um is not such an issue of your stories underground first apple\nSo listen to some of the other ideas kind of capture storage what are some of the ideas here\nSo the idea with carbon capture traditionally has been you take a power plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid the will to going into the atmosphere\nWith negative emissions or the way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme by again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energies to takes you to that's in the atmosphere\nPhotosynthesis will store that the will to into the crops than you burn the crops in the power plant and instead of putting that Syria to back into the atmosphere you're gonna do the same thing compress it and stored underground and\nThat has the potential to remove a billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground were tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to it has a similar\nNegative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for\nCrops that we're going to use the stores here too and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could a Korean food security issues which is something we want to avoid what what\nNot and by the way I just said Steven Pinker is a terrific and provocative new book a nightmare now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on a technologies that we aren't you know we don't even have yet that we're going to come along\nAnd the fact that a lot of this is going to be on a technologies that we aren't you know we don't even have yeah we are going to come along but what about just fucking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical process to use and you know we've already been doing this and things like submarines or spacecraft where you need to remove the CEO to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd so the idea is could we do that at an industrial scale and capture CEO to the Senate air capture that seemed to compress it and then stored underground\nThat is appealing one of the most appealing aspects of that is it doesn't have this large land impact\nThat almost every other one of the schemes has the biggest downside so far has been it's been dismissed as a prohibitively expensive so\nSomething like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes\nCrime or actually Swiss started up and they say the conflict between six hundred and eight hundred for metric kind of sealed to capture I'm getting another company in Canada can protect crushing to kill any fifty per metric can fix catch expensive\nThat's expensive just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to\nOver the whole world now I think a number of about five dollars is about right there is other places it's high like in Sweden and then you got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about the technology is is the concept come down so as you say climb works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of sea to\nTheir next plan plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of CEO to\nThere's another company called carbon engineering in Canada has things that can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there's a U.S company called the global thermostat\nThat uh is doing it the first demonstration in Alabama this year and they think that'll be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get it down to a hundred after that so this idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it\nIt seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built without severe problems and with costs that seemed to be starting to come down so there's the potential to really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have the lemon juice impacts\nAnd with costs it seemed to be starting to come down so there's the potential to really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have a lemon juice impacts\nOne of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of CEO to by mid century um and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned\nThat's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I\nI think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies\nBut that really doesn't fit with the scale the challenger facing so that's that's the real challenge for direct heir captures how you scale up from three companies doing on the order of five or six plants to something like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten years\n[laughter] sounding well are you getting the investors excited about that [laughter]\nYou know that that may be the future but look again Steven Pinker writes set the more speculative and as this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse pulverized rock it takes up CEO tuition weather's to add alkaline cloud to the ocean to dissolve more CEO to either water\nFertilize the ocean with iron to accelerate photosynthesis by plankton and again ... out of the atmosphere in different ways where do you say though\nTo how her job I'm a fellow of seeing things at MIT who says in the fact that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing CEO to emissions if people start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes\nCalled a ... term for it as moral hazard this idea that\nIf you have this technology available it's kind of like an insurance policy and then you'll engage in risky behavior and in this case it means you won't produce the missions uh enough", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city":
