eighty two more were released\nTheir stories told the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha I think he said the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families and their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nThe yeah it was a part of the condition of the access we hosted the kid the access with the government's consent is the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the bells about what had happened to them\nDuring the three is that they were held by Boko Haram boy yeah partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them in the government's safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks it was quite rules they um ... still processing what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when our counselors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened\nThat we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to buddy ... any time we were alone with the girls the government mind as an security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government also I wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held a three is before and it does say some wisdom and they were released\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like well they they um they was free to speak to us\nAnd they were released\nWhat what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to his uh they did give us a diaries discreetly ... and they kind of make it clear that law enforcement goods that they\nWere forced to marry if not they would have the\n... the coldest and the full Boko Haram treatment [noise] uh and in the film what we do is the uh the bills that the girls who have taken was actually just the tip of the iceberg there are thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the to the book goes as\nWell so such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\n[noise] yeah so what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... or ... become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the Gulf felt like they you know we're right\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it's they see you know as she says I was two months pregnant\nWhen I ran away and when we first met ... like see she did tell us I don't love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men here have ... have either been kidnapped or killed during this will say well ... has been kidnapping children but also older men\nThe kids who have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay about ... has been conducting children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill an arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of Boko Haram they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention\nGlobally yeah it is astonishing I think older folks as it's being on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these they called them id Pete camps or intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run to his book her um you know they don't just could not they then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to run\nAnd the ... but then a lot of the uh uh loves entirely displaced people end up living within the community say\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they've also been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nI mean I'm made a gory is in a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize control the Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we would that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks\nIn one night and he just never know I hate to\nThat can last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was sick suicide attacks\nIn one night and he just never know who to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women I've to cycle and then they stopped them up and send them towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into ... said the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line woods I Know you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I say there's a lot of mistrust [noise] what

at the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy tomorrow\nWell why do we fought for skin ... take on fungi with a five minute we can recap\nDay and they should sponsored by Google over\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now and John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new show\nOn let's take this first change Fox is calling it the Ninety nine second sixty second breast sorry I'd be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial ... so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you're just they've got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs there are basically putting these in sixty seconds units which are actually a second you this I've got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching as\nThe also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand and content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in volume do advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say in the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain it\nAll right John Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest than they'd is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joined us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day and so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own source that are buying a car and you can rent one from someone\nThere is a day and so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using their cars we already own source that are buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will\nBe shared yeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about this specific how get around works uh right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you don't arrive you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you picked our car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nAnd lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attack us led to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... a which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\n[noise] no we think this is a mass of opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\nWell some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said\nThat those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent a car from a stranger when they could just jump in the left\nIs I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers is that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live\nBut they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to ... or so it was continue investing was partnerships and expanding our or Russia or partners\nWill speaking of rubber and Toyota neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact it's autonomy cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself what'd you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day in probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace like get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to them\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of vehicles are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than drop it off and then it would go somewhere else\nBuilt into the ring on G.

endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez than it does is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this races reporter WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe a German so senator\nUses which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race he's a reporter WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nHi Jeremy so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in the midst trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWill and he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy he was you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring\nTo and what about Bob ... he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAt the end of the day is a question about just\nJudgment you want sitting biting\nOff you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not ties with three times for those cancer patients politically need ...\nHas blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes has called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro\nFormer company makes his called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up ... and has also you know ... or settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the\nCampaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the the Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's ... he's the first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez is ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey is pretty pretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often does elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank well beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so\nIt does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support in the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\n[laughter] that is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you\nPort and the party and just as you know popularity previously\nThat is to earn it is of W H where I was talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got it\nOr don't know that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of

including Generation Z and the eye generation these are people born between the mid nineties and twenty twelve dish\nThe generation alludes to the fact that this generation has been connected to the Internet since birth\nBy twenty twenty Generation Z will make up about a third of the U.S population and will be more diverse than any previous generation so what do we know about them joining us now is Jean ... who is the author of the book I Jan and a professor of psychology at San Diego State University welcome to hear now\nThank you tell me what what defines this generation\nTill I joined spends a lot\nMore time on line and on digital media than previous generations dead and so that means they have less time for other things so they spend less time interacting with their friends in person they spend less time sleeping and perhaps because of those trends they\nAlso are experiencing much higher rate of anxiety and depression and self harm behaviors like cutting um compared to teens just five or ten years ago and\nThis is the generation also that ah grew up uh either they weren't born when nine eleven happened or they were very young when nine eleven happened which makes them very different than the millennial generation\nAlthough I don't think nine eleven is the main reason for that I think the great recession as well as\nThe gross of the use of the smart sign or that the two big events and it really ... produce said the bigger differences and the really big shift between ... and ... is an optimism and high expectations\nAnd it really ... produce that the bigger differences and the really big shift between millennials in ige and\nIs in optimism and high expectations and and self esteem millennials are very confident generation with very high expectations very optimistic\nAnd I can really is not um those trends that have been building for decades toward more positivity more optimism really turned around with ige and they're much more pessimistic generation is not as confident in themselves\nIs that comparable to any other generation that we've had in history\n[laughter] well that sudden shift between ... and ... is unusual um I've been doing work on generational differences for a long time and the transitions between say boomers and Gen ... millennials or not as dark as it is a much more sudden shift between millennials in ...\nAnd what what is the reason for that is that just because of the great recession or why why would they be so pessimistic\nWell heck with some variables it's the it's the great recession for most of them the\nTrend it turns around at about twenty eleven or twenty twelve that's when the smartphone gain market saturation when the percentage of Americans who owned a smartphone crossed fifty percent so that is probably at the root of it that when a smartphone became common then teen socialize really shifted it shifted\nOn line and then it away from in person social interaction\nNow let's talk about the smartphones for a second because we've all become addicted to our smartphones no matter what generation we're in what difference does it make that these people in our gender Generation Z are so young when that's happening\n[laughter] yeah and certainly the smartphone has had an impact of of ah people across many generations and many age groups but I think it has had the biggest impact on this generation has never known it any other way many ... can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what\nReally shape sound a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend that time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that\nDone this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\n[laughter] well there is certainly awareness or that a lot of time they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted but Ninety five percent of teens I'm outta smartphone now\nAnd it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to and your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post the lake on Instagram poses so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jim is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history and that's reflected in these big um service that I work with where they're asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds\nSo say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds that's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped the generation\nWell that's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\nTrue um but because there's not a draft road that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nHad they they do have to market it to this generation differently because there's there's such a big generational shift\nI think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in our conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nIs very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think\nThey're very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on\nAnd um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these\nPotential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBut statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting or are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say they're interested in government or social issues\nOr politics Dan teams were say Twenty years ago what do you think so\nUm well I think because there's so many other things to do there's always the\nPossibility of a you know something new to say on I'm On social media or a new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard\n... interesting I mean I've had some many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart or I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nSo absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think yeah smarts is is definitely not the issue", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "22"}
