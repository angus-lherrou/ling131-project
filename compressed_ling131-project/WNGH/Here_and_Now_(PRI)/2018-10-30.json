thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nKrueger combination of mom or preferred to store which remember short term interest rates and\nThat's where they're more sulfur store for turned your treasury milk and sugar\nThat is doing which remember is short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and say the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with them about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America history which he co authored with Adrian wool drudge I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to\nStructure of the company for example the so called rust belt\nIs populated largely by industries which are very old\nSilicon Valley for example is a classic case of a very you know\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation threw out the country and it depends obviously whether they were in areas where it was sort of being prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast to\nWhere the issue of high tech stock prices everyone talks about the one thing about this country is very diverse\nHow does depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge added this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nOn the lookout into the future\nAll we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity\nWell basically because\nYou know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it I'm a consequence\nIs basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh this inclination to take risks\nIn the book and suddenly I might add discussing what are the last the longest\nUh this inclination to take risks\nIn the book and suddenly I might add discussing whether the law of the long term outlook is all about\nWe say that the issue the aging of the population\nHas consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that\nIn title ... which are mandated by law\nOf gradually and inexorably driving our gross domestic savings and the economy dollar for dollar\nOn so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit\nWe're now built up in a trillion dollar that to foreigners but what this is causing this\nThere's largely the demographics issue the fact that the population is aging right now the official actuaries of their Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance\nHave to cut benefits by twenty five percent and definitely into the future do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFor civil rights like it's going to happen\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out\nSo long as you don't do it a good cause the debt overall total government that over a rise indefinitely\nAnd that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation ... it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example\nInterest rates since ... century bc Greece but not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that\nInterest rates will rise if for no other reason that the below the long term human nature to determine stability\nDo you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we trip rates low\nCost ... point employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace\nAnd the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling\nBelow a brief usual expectation\nWith productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh\nThey're not ... kept falling below four percent with no impact on information\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that\nWhat we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand [noise] 'cause there are two conditions are hard for a crisis\nIs there a toxic asset like\nSecure dies two mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages are financed\nWon the finance\nThat's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nI don't want to be a general you know that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowed it would have been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep rates down during the period of very low unemployment\nBut that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that the people that want to hire\nAre having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially\nAbs seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not lower productivity\nBut it's the issue or when you get to sort of tight labor market\nWage rates speaking to arise of necessity\nAnd it's for wage rate rises which\nThe cost of production\nHence induce corporations to start raising prices\nBasically because their costs are going up that's where the problem\nHas a really big on that\n[noise] I Want to ask you about

Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that I'm afraid to enjoy the community that covers the diversity in the community of ...\nAnd um he loves walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various chemicals and synagogues and churches\nUm that own made him feel at home um that they grief that delicatessens and he often commented that he could hear yeah the Hebrew and it doesn't have\nMade him feel at home um that they grief that delicatessens and he often commented that he could get a sense Hebrew and a dozen other languages spoken as you walk down the street of that community\nHe actually learned ... and they\nPaid get gas or do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on squirrel hill\n[noise] um\nThe neighborhood I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrel hell neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighborhood neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think what's reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd probably also taken the lead probe community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence uh we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination\nOr that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nIs that the nation me\n[noise]\nHave you heard that a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it\nMeans\nSomebody getting killed\nSort of surprised way\nThat's what happened you know steady and killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now\nMany people are talking about a\nScared about it you know\nI'd rather talk about some other day\nHe liked [noise]\nSet sound a courtesy of the Fred Rogers company laid ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic a as she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many\nUh she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh [noise]\nI think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grim now where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the\nAmbulances the doctors the nurses everyone um have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who are cause destruction\nI've seen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers\nAs part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence little some\nBeen terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the media has been showing recently\nI played for your protection\nIn support\nOf your young children\nThere is just so much\nA very young child can take\nWith out of me overwhelming [noise]\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is\nTo be telling parents um right now to do with their kids [laughter]\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of us to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good nest attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message\nSo looking for the helpers helps uh see the good that is still around us for ... said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time\nCreating a encouragement and spaces where children and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way\nThere were British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend [noise]\nWhile I think he would be horrified by what happened in ... and he would\nHe would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions to the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness\nI'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um and you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and\nTo grin on TV and streaming live rich you could be

G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but uh he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMight the wind was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAri let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminal\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let how it's ... it's my turn out raising my measure and they get out it's my turn your ... going to get a shot for our it's like OK here's Cordray getting a word and we are the\nStates in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports said we had the highest increase in ... last year and he stays in the nation are if so what we're doing right now\nIn the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stays in the nation are if so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day of because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes\nAnd take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but uh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for\nThat is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or order people what's on their minds\nWell it seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions\nThere trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have in this election that can vote\nAnd um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there is a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redrawn\nOh a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal and Ohio\nIs a big deal it's always a big deal that Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good\nOpportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I had some effect on it\n[noise] that's showing goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you\nRepresentatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven Macs a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning the plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us now is ed Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it\nLike something more than that something perhaps\nTo do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know if that played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going\nYou could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that is happening in my mind goes to a a crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issue some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issue some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly in the pilots\nOr you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a ... very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll slated flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane it had flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brain of airplanes sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nYou're listening to here and now [noise]\n\nI'm Sarah I'm and I am an out of the blue and Blue Ridge Georgia boy specialize in wines from around the world and Hyun cheeses and we also
