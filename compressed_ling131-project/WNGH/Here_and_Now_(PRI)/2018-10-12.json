diabetes or as a writer and the guardian put it after reading Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep not sleeping has been making me stupid or fatter unhappy airport sicker worse that sex as well as more likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that\nAnd students topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night well now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiate is he\nAlso teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the success of that class Harvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class than as well\n... is with us in the studio welcome thank you very much he was just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWhile they were pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of the students are took the course students were actually lining up to fill out the questionnaire about their positive responses to the bitter collision program\nWell what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some other groups study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah A M ms course Louis popular courses or computer science courts that has actually hack of times where the students are scheduled to work all night for the course and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean the\nFootball team and us from getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled\nIn many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say they'd o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is a set up for the students staying up all night\nLong extended to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light\nScience project they have phones and they have their social media that keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets our circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest drive for waking just before what would be dusk I'm so during evolution or we couldn't see during the night time\nAnd the brains send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together than be in a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside and when we decide to switch off the lot\nWell there's that we we talked about some of the\nHealth issues that arise disrupts sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWill I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes or nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and deaths willing\nAnd Matthew walkers book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ad for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer dementia\nIn wars of cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke not mentioned diabetes are you interested well of course it's sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you\nGoing to do as your appetite I mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart\nAttacks on the other adverse all comes down to lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but\nHow can they this to students and it's part of the culture\nAccent or other adverse outcome could lay down right now in just prepare for the grim reaper but how can they this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nPart of the programs are we call it sleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information that click on his sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time\nIf they're on a sports team they'll shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more failing all free throws in and one of the things that students don't realize is that it's not just the amount of sleep but consistency in the timing of sleep so students have irregular schedules\nThere do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we studied Harvard students we found that those who had irregular schedules even if they got this same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston\nAnd that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder that they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention to the middle of the night\nLoud so how do you change school life so that kids can see maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am I right\nSo when I have been teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seminar have to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity\nSchool sanctioned activity and the first ah scheduled activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you working now we're talking to you most specifically that students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from bringing the Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers firefighters you take this\nStudents but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters you take this problem with twenty four percent less likely to report in injury used have as many disability days I mean you can trace how meal life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post some of the sit here now dot org\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shift there's nothing you can do to help their sleep and we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour canoe in detail so we did is sleep disorders screening for example\nFor ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires way identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea\nOr chronic insomnia or other disorders and we refer them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and women out of six women\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep if he can't breathe and sleep at the same time ... you're not going to get the rest that you need\nAnd when we first came to present to them they made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the sessions\nMissing construction workers seven men died you're listening to here and

and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it liberal and\nI think some will be dead and others will be inside the city itself up ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a show old or did a deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up they offer them a way out whether they would be bust up to his lip\nAnd that's why they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah and in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive

California's Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new students made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart harsh report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs it for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for their immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story pull him a welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new is made of bed sheets in Fifteen cells\nHow is that possible uh well that's a good\nQuestion you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of were issues that needed to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from events in so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nShould we imply then that that many people inside the facility worst suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those choices yeah I I don't think so\nUm you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would on for all the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guards sort of laughed at them off and then call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempt weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside the building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nSo the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was ... you know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a questions of ...\nYeah it was you know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a question of untimely an adequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and you know the thing about immigration detention is it's supposed to be\nWhat they call civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive and nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to happen\nAnd so when you're using\nDisciplinary segregation in ways that are more humid if that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned that doctors stamp their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to foster teeth\nI'm like what if the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving the immigration\nDetention is governed by or what are called his performance space national detention standards and not governs everything about medical care that\n\nThis fall we're counting on the participation of everyone who listens to cover the rising cost of programs we bring you an GB if we didn't hear from you

G was murdered\nWashington Post is reporting that turkey has audio and video proof that he was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nShot and you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the consulate more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia the BBC's mark low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nThat'd be a source close to touch investigation said turkey has gone documents that evidence to support the claim off state sponsored ... she went into the Saudi consulates in Istanbul ten days ago\nAnd this also said tells us that I'm On course official position is stale that fictional cheat is missing about that a tax intelligence knows for sure that he was mud\nAnd not backs up the American news reports and all that audio and have a ... a video evidence the recordings showing that mistake a show she was a northern e\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that\nAnd they're very gruesome details coming out including recordings allegedly of him being beaten I'm On some reports that had ... men but I'm the Saudi or official was Saudi authorities are still ... to knowing all the allegation how reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence\nUm I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this strange communication strategy with his governments\nI Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this strange communication strategy with his government here in techie where they don't really speak directly to\nForeign media for example they and they don't actually have a ... communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moving pictures that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach\nThat for example turkey has welcomed in Saudi officials here to be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation or that the Saudis have proposed\nThat is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't want to settle on diplomatic relationship at this stage but they all lead king\nI'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that type thing the screws on the Saudis and try and get the ... western backing for the position that question about that joint committee the Saudi Turkish investigation has to be how credible\nIt can be if it includes the Saudi Government yeah and and I think that it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint somebody the crimes inquiry what the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of\nUm a diplomatic nice city on the part of us the tux entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have called the evidence to back up their espresso allegation and there is some more irony here as well to turkey is pushing a case\nThat a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists or are people noting that at all\nThe biggest jailer of journalists I mean yes there has been noted particularly by Chuck E. ... such as a spot and\nYou know that said at tech he is not treating journalists in the same way as a journalist is alleged are being treated that it's not monitoring hey we're talking about uh how tech is locked up journalists which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on liberal values but\nBut uh yeah there is some distance between the two cases I think here in our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and his stumble\nHow much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the racial Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage\nBought a I think that you know clearly tucked he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect a flagrant violation of its sovereignty ate it won't support from the U.S and from other western governments\nClearly tech he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect the flagrant violation of its sovereignty ate it won't support from the U.S in from other western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis when speaking\nOf diplomacy there's one other breaking news story want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson held in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government\nUh what are we learning about that [noise] yeah this is a country that produces more news than I can see him ready and American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in the ... the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not interfere with the independence of the ... which is seen as laughable bike by critics of of tacky and what's happened today that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which\nBasically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody so Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was a source of massive friction between the U.S in an untouched governments\nThat sanctions tariffs and plunging of attack US Currency that as well and I expected to east to some extent\nAnd it will be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory
