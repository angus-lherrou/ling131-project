Jeremy and what more do we know about this new Saturday explanation for what happened\nWell we we know it hasn't fully hasn't come out yet a there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted what's interesting about this is that it echoes something that a President Trump said yesterday morning after he'd spoken with king cell bond the father uh Mohammed bin Salman his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nAnd the you know yesterday the president talked about a a broke group of people maybe having a kill Jamal ... uh and then that's what the Saudis are floating at the issue here is that the Saudis are looking to accept responsibility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they they're facing\nThe threat of sanctioned and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to\nUh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and when\nYou said the explanation was being crafted does that imply that might compare the secretary of state is helping the Saudis craft the explanation for what happened\nWell it's unusual that before an explanation comes out like Mike Pompeo is there a while if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my bum pay was explained to the Saudis at this was a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered\nA that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses the president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the sort of Saudis need to do something\nGauges and human rights abuses the president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the sort of Saudis need to do something so that the next step can take place what\nHas all this done to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia end with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia or not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nSupport\nFor G.

that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now thanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's it's just something that ... as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice\nWhere uh I and I needed to use it in a way\nJust to demonstrate what is happening is not normal\nAnd I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary and how did it start [noise]\nStarted somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first are twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter] and I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone or said that I was throwing shade on the new\nA new president and you didn't even know what that tournament I didn't even know what that term that after you know I started oppose the war and then I heard the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen\nThe biggest credit history was really on January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it I mean I kind of picture says it All right right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true yes\nI Do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's ... very rarely is there\nA negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is a minute\nVery rarely is there\nA negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is a my grand followers are have my back and they they ended up coming back to the end they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know if they're rushing botched but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my Instagram feed just\nAnd saying what they want to say\nIn this book you've got a often either Trump tweets a alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post there's one I'm\nLooking at right here I'm President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community if it's staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote\nStuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest\nI mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf and but ... says just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me\nSo that was sort of just a you know tell me in cheek hawk poke I guess\nWhat's the one that you're most proud of the like I Can't believe I thought of that\nUh the the [laughter]\nI have to I correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\nYou know a Trump does always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all caps a ... in regards to the\nFBI and investigation um [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a a a young girl dressed as a witch at a at a Halloween party and I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which\nI I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that he had more of an immigration and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News\nOf a President Trump saying that he had more of an operation and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other network and you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty Times Union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up\nA and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand ten state union was the largest in history [noise]\nIt seems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened to show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them [noise]\nAh yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to\nEspecially you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over was when he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and\nYou know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff\nAnd I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one rocket man [laughter]\nWhat is President Obama think of what you're doing\nYou know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this and\nA ... boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book and it just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to the U.S ownership of all the photos\nThat you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post among the ... you\nKnow these are all a pictures that were previously made public or in the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a\nHas a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures everyday of President Obama\nSo so what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures everyday of President Obama or do you would you want to do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from\n'em at least us politics for sure how come [noise]\nUm because I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had\nA dynamic a a\nPerson to a photograph every day\nUm someone that I had you know admired someone who gave me incredible access\nAnd I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics\nWhen I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could and and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened\n\nNow is the

experiment of grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents of the minority students objected to look Hassan is director of the little red schoolhouse it tell us first what was your thinking and trying this\nUh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement\nWell you said that are part of this was based on you know research this wasn't an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identities what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um\nCultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity of developing that\nBeing part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development and other academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experience and let's say the teachers away and the students are black then\nThey have different schooling experience isn't that affects the minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's it's much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student isn't that a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both of those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYeah this is an unheard of than twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school\nHad its junior class divided so for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with but you know any time\nOr language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know what do you worry about the width of that\nWe do and I I Would say two things about that one if you you know those people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice is what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these are students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room\nAnd the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from you know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school but look what happened parents objected to have you dropped the policy or decided not to expand that what's going on\nAnd we will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what it what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan uh where you had to end is this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by the new you know um other kids feel super supported so lots of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's filled cats and director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan I don't think so much it's been a pleasure tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educator who says there are times to group kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise] okay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the finalists in the annual ...\nTimes to group kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise] okay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the finalists in the annual comedy wildlife photography awards tiger Freetown sell them is a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat is a very good question our shoes cost me the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I didn't have to think about why I just that's how I Do my every ... technique\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can also have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he's saying job [laughter] it's called caught in the act or from photographer marrying a gallon I mean that's laugh out loud\nLoud and is definitely one of my favorites I think it was supposed to go just to see the animal and the ...

last week five members of the European Parliament calls to the European Commission to back an investigation into college his murder\nCiting revelations from the forbidden stories work including that the Maltese governments sale of Maltese passports to wealthy Russians for one million euros\nWas enabling those Russians to enter European Union countries and carry out money laundering and other crimes Lauren ... is founder and executive director of forbidden stories\nLow rent a un other reporters picked up quite a few of the threads that Daphne Carolina leads yeah was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we were thanks to the world cup for forty five reporters for about six months we were able to\nReveal some um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the motives\nI learned and we were reading some concerning farts about some potential links between the economy minister\nOn some of the people left in the ... because they were triggering to build that were really pushing the button pushing the button yeah they were using a cell phone that was connected to the bold under the calls for ... like at its own today\nOr she is she has been killed a police the suspected of doing that and they were arrested\nOr so during the investigation with the world cup that I'm ...\nActually the aspect of doing that and they were arrested and so during that investigation with the world cup that that's a ...\nTeam we were able to meet some people who told us that they are seeing they couldn't even Easter with those two ... before the murder\nAnd to the work of the ... project was not only about to identify who might be the key those but it's up to ... the stories of Daphne\n... very critical work because her stories was about sensitive issue like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to complete the destiny of the name of that politic what's adopt their project\nAgain you had a Maltese governments she was doing an investigation into possible corruption having to do with matters of the economy and here you have\nYou found the economic minister connecting with some of the suspects in her death that's quite something look I I just want to back up and and talked about how this started because it's sending a compelling story you worked in a news agency across the hall\nFrom the Charlie Hebdo office tell us tell us about your experience there\nOn investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and um I used to travel a lot into 'em do some reporting some countries where there was no freedom of press\nBut to another think convinced me personally a personal defense my in my life convinced me to talk for begins to reason do step and actually twenty Fifteen when to terrorists of al Qaida in Yemen arrive\nIn the streets where the offices of the company where I was working full worlds in that race\nAnd they into the ... and they killed ... newsroom were sharing the same\nRules that were the right to the door right next to her and these day address to arrive to date to me and it says to the terrorists just kept the building and I ... into the newsroom and then I I was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just totally dead\nAnd we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so\nThis is literally changed my life because this was happening in Paris this was not happening on conflict so it was such an Iraq twice in the middle of pirates twice in my personal environment\nIt was a bold clicks I knew and we're doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... they were killed forced to\nIt was a bold ... exciting new and we're doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... they were killed forced to leave they were able to publish an so\nIt was really traumatic experience I took a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult pictures\nBut on that day I decided\nTo what I can do as a journalist to continue the work of murder to report to us to keep stories alive and usually when a to Z dining for one story that probably means that the story's very we live and to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep these stories of life you\nKnow he said something so compelling there he usually when journalists get killed there on to something and so for you it's about\nFiguring out what that was it as you say sending a message out to the murderers you can kill the messenger but you will kill the message the story at look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter Don ... was killed in Nineteen Seventy six\nNew organization sprung up it was called the investigative reporters and editors and they set out to finish his work but there has been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work\nWe also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper or was attacked in so many killed threats were made against the Boston Globe by California man he threatened to kill all of them do you do you just there I mean it doesn't feel is is you know the message is getting out\nYeah well um we are really facing a lot of threats not totally\nIn South America and not only in Mexico in Europe too\nIn a an old continents and I think that\nThe the only response which is very efficient it's the globe of an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to get the\nIf the Cuba will see that there was a group of children who is ready to complete investigation and to expose the crimes then that will probably think twice the next time they would think about killing one report\nYou were talking about the reason that project that's great and very sprawling project and I do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send this pool full signal to the enemies of the press to kill the messenger you would never kill the message because we are here to make sure people to get access to these very important stories so yes there was uh\nHere to make sure people to get access to this is very important story so\nYes there was a lot of work we need some support there a lot of children is to have been killed there are a lot of many forbidden stories beyond that we need to publish\nIt's quite children to do that and a journalist who is dying is just it's it's not just to a number we took ... pulled them stories important information that some people want to to hide some people want to to silence\nWell and there are other groups I met I mentioned investigative reporters and editors\nThere's also the group organized crime corruption reporting project that pursuit another investigation twenty Fifteen\nWhen a of an investigative journalist was locked up in either by John as there is a Brazilian nonprofit organization I think it's a ... a B. R. A. J. honestly they continue the work of another reporter so\nThis has been going on this as you say collaborative so that it's the investigative work is spread out among many reporters that brings us to the Saudi journalist who wrote for among other papers the Washington Post\nTo Marcus Jody I'm us and Turkish officials believe that he was murdered inside the Saudi conflict in Turkey [noise]\nHave you been already eyeing his work\nWell of course I'm this is the kind of case that we we should be interested in what of history use he was ... he was walking along we need to [noise]\nTo know mobile the Saudi regime and we need to to expose that so that so\nI Hope we get more information to build the appearance of a of this um ...
