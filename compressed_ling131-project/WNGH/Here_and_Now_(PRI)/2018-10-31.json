three dozen people gather together to come up with amendments to the state constitution Florida is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question\nDanny Rivera of W ELL around explains if you live in Florida\nShin which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL around explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also banned vaping in the workplace or you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military [noise]\nThese two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the rivers and commissioned Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable I think that what the constitution revision commission did is it packed\nThings that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but thought would be popular\nThat's all Broward County is top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandate a State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county to have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda it's sandwiched in between none of it now but by\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way Frieden and some legal experts see it this time is different\n[noise] Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromise that had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nThis year every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not\n... as was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see\nShe says politics were not at play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really adding a somewhat of an access or natural connection game is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and ...\nAnd everything really adding a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens I think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beams and my voting record would speak to that\nBut for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make this short or an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment needs to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible us all the more you unfold in different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot\nThree other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nJustice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they are voting on but the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party and they had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where\nFor here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there\nAre a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThird example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years\nOverall the total number of statewide measure as has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in ...\nAll the total number a statewide measure as has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a signature petition signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that just gets referred to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\n[laughter] so what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting [noise]\nYeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year or other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThey process varies by state the number of signatures required as usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand in a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty eight for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be gene to voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group at a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on the ballot\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process is a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as a sort of a method of last resort if they are not getting what they want done\nThe legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as a sort of a method of last resort if they are not getting what they want done in the legislature and\nThey see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove that rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process is used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine that last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiatives you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface the response to the twenty sixth the initiatives was\n\n[noise] my name is Dana Brown I Am the program manager at the Georgia adapt to the union

Mueller and it's not about the results of his investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations Mueller's office has referred to the FBI that women were offered money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him\nAnd be our national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird those what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so ah there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who called herself woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller\nAnd what may be the cases that woman actually does not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr is it possible that these women because I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that needed it was too that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here has special counsel's office it it it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI\nAnd well there are two conservative media personalities Jacob all and yet Berkman who are said to be linked to the story to tell us about that that's right wall\n... well there are two conservative media personalities take a bull and jak Berkman who I had to be linked to the story to tell us about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friends supporter Chris Ruddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office and Miller himself and that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involving a period of misconduct by Mahler\nUm they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gay we pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report that was linked to a so called\nAh intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified ah because no one knows which things into their true and which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors and models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so I ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these willing to say something about ... I think what ... what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap\nTo try to get reporters to talk about them found none of that is clear however we do know the special counsel's office has this has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\nIn ... in other words if somebody was masking masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you\nEmail earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end the temporary protected status TPS\nFor immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua that ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand ... didn't have to have an immediate threat of deportation\nThe door Haiti in Nicaragua that ruling meant that an estimated three hundred thousand immigrants didn't have to have\nAn immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lives are already turned upside down during the ... plus months when they believe they'd have to leave the United states\nHe wind Robby is one example of that she's a TPS holder from Sudan it say recently war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago was prepared to lose her temporary protected status on November second which had been the deadline she joined us in the studio welcome\nThank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U.

Olsen\nAnd yeah I mean I I've never done a play before but it has announcement at the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating it is a moment ... some of ... like make the audience go oh this guy's being ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous until I find like five you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nYou feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that he kept going yeah well I did when when you would make a point did did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good play you know the events of the players\nTo be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of 'cause they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I hurt people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim's single was standing there with thirty literally thirty of his relatives who've flown in from all over the country and and I when I opened the books at which they kindly gave for opening night Jim's comment was man we could use to\nUse your character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's the she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish 'cause she really thinks it will help at this moment in time but at the same time she is\nA journalist and Dana damn it every night as I come down to the moment of the play where decision has to be made you and your character have not made up their mind until the moment I reach for the phone wow it's who convinces me\nOther that's awesome you if you publish Illinois all every night now that's a that's got to be called post show the briefing\nBringing money [laughter] I don't know what's been going wrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I was talking about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are thirty one strip clubs that thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't\nThe guy was saying things like yeah there are thirty one step closer to thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or news\nFor between it as a piece of writing a newspaper\nThere is no different than the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play oh yeah\nThere is a difference in our and artistic peace being written in an effort you know what would you say about the Greek histories what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four because you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously to your character is not a bad guy we're in real life at home\nAbout a guy anyway he's just he's a writer in order\nTo be a life he he has said that the real writer has said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroyed them and they continue to do so um but I think it's fair joined does it work for the Washington Post who's not writing articles for writing articles ...\nNew York times he's he's a looming eating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that follows it a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line in most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nAnd there's a whole world effects to choose from the wrong facts getting the way of the story\nAnd your test us as the wrong facts what does that mean exactly\nWhat you got to be aware that we have a presidential health person Kellyanne Conway you spoke of alternative facts you're nodding cherry\nIs interesting because there's a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and\nIt frequently gets applause the argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in it the whole thing can for the policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debate about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is kind of going oh come on clearly you are going to fathers and know the difference of math as you go to Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it true or you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating certain point we give single do start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case about picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense\nYou do both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the middle talked about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance is\nStrangling each yes yes they are already know winning that fight [laughter] I saw the U.S strongly Daniel okay\nYeah it does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way but\n\n[noise] my name is Dave poly ... on the executive director of

communities worldwide learn more at ... dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThey sit here and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures high ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they're Ninety nine it's because one state the brass guy does not have the house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why our Republican so dominant at the state level\nWent over well with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've run candidates that have fared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what is that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\nWell they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on that\nSo they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape in the states as they had a very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that and um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade\nBut yes the the twenty twenty censuses right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eight to the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's all right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled\nIn less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as thirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday\nAnd you know that that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions and two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year a water the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of the state house as\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nFrom the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nFor a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country\nSo they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country and there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is\n... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years um they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into\nLegislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures but um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\n[noise] uh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislature who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because\nSo it's better for the U.S house um so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and um and then to your point it then it does sort of turn into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's all about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle protected on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV
