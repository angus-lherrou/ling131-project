increase in hate crimes across the country jak rose in his presidency the American Jewish Congress jak words fail you know we're so sorry about this wrong to community but has it's been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nMy first thought was this was a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tax not only are the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it goal was to have been living in America comfortable accepted in all communities around the country\nSee changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities\nAnd here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America\n[laughter] well uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred to make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five times more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we see more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols of loans Jewish cemeteries schools this act on Saturday is quite a shock to the community and to America is seems to\nAnd you know we all know the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out of out of your feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing\nExcept you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents do you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize or so political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe a [noise] those that have had been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against them\nThe ah [noise] those that have had been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and maybe that will send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this political leaders say they have the microphones most important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from both parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are met governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue in if we can mobilize yeah with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the polls is necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that tourists began as\nWell and actually some would say we're hearing the opposite for president have been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by marching right nationalist in Charlottesville in August twenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line the white nationalist a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that cameras are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like\nLet's listen to these marches target here but let's listen to these marches again in charge now\n\nDown from a documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter allegedly counting in in a God that had to be telling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong time being sets America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all be hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make I was just happened to be watching to sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nShots ... discussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred\nClearly sharp and show no TV yesterday\nShots NBC a\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you the wrong county's been studying you said to myself what about that and\nYou're speaking of Louis Farrakhan leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and\nRepublican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nJoe hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphone she's going to\nUh you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nHere in the

about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut cigarettes Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide it's also about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together secret newness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise]\nMy experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing [noise]\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and finally O'Connor and Kafka and you're courting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the ...\nTeachers but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden what do we know about whether dogs grieve\nWe do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll\nNow I remember I had to put a little dog sleep ones and the person who came to the house it it's better that the other dog see this [noise] uh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shots started an injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top of that to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating ... and then he did more afterwards\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we kept and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean this whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something he's going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life would be thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of that is a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody asks where the party are near the woman who's in love with the dog\n... with a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life as literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and\nEight or in this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books in certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I I kept thinking I should Google this I should go to this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they've seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think um need a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide [noise] boy could be boats\nOr maybe the friend is the narrator now\nAnd what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog well\nMy ... my married are really does this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like\nShe says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble with this idea of dominating any animal\nAnd you don't dominate cats you'd do dominate other animals horses dogs you know at some point she says there almost two poignant and their relations with the person or a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nNow dogs can be unbearably poignant she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat with trying to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do ask her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cats out there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes\n[laughter] that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and say they just have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch\nI say it because I Do see a lot

health education\nThe law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death for young Americans in twenty sixteen\nSuicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death the young Americans in tiny sixteen the car accidents Glenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years and tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the ... the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm In diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that or\nOr a little different in a rural area suburban areas in the city not that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island\nMay have more of an acceptance of the idea of therapy and mental health being on the table than let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used correct\nAnd there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has the taken into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do do in response is we were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of uh\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou've got a teacher training there and other tools so willing people are here now doubt or it's the sample like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what might a specific part of a curriculum day and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school especially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and\nJust general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the\nThe structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half\nGet treatment this night also funnel people to we'll treatment as opposed to education but as you know there's opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want\nTeachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma talk about things like the connection\nBasic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know took about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing gee educators families that\nYou know this is just a normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's going to let him and he's the c._e._o. the nonprofit mental health association of New
