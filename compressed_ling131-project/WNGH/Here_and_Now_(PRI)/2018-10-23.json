Governor Charlie Baker is the most popular governor in America again a Republican in Massachusetts he facing Democrat Jay Gonzales at last check is almost forty points ahead of him in the polls\nAnthony Brooks is senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston he joins us by Anthony hey Charlie and why is a Republican like they are so popular in Massachusetts well\nWhen it comes down to is that he represents a brand of Republicanism that works really well in Massachusetts is relatively conservative on fiscal issues he doesn't like raising taxes but he's liberal on social issues like abortion rights and marriage equality and he works well with the state legislature which is dominated by Democrats so\nIn this age of hyper partisanship across the country Baker represents something very different that appeals not only to Republicans in the state but according to our polls to lots of Democrats and independents as well you'd\nProbably call him a Democrat if you were in any other state here is in a recent debate with chickens I was talking about issues that matter to him a where he has to go against the president\nI've always been quite clear about where I stand on a whole series of things with respect to the president and managed to work pretty hard over the course of the past four years to stop some of the things that the Congress and the president was proposing that would have been particularly damaging to Massachusetts ... cuts the cuts in the end I H\nM and cancer and other forms of research and a lot of the work we did associated with a travel ban immigration\nWhat more do we know about his politics as well as we mentioned he's moderate a fiscally cautious socially liberal by contrast his Democratic opponent Jay Gonzales wants to talk about big democratic programs raise taxes on the rich and that's billions and transportation education\nProvide tuition free college and move toward single payer health care system\nBaker is much more cautious I kind of cautious fiscal manager presents himself as a responsible custodian of government a government for example he's made modest investments in early childhood education an effort to fix the T the state's public transportation system but he opposes the kind of big tax hikes and big programs that comes ...\nIs trying to remind people that Baker is in fact Republican listen to this moment from that same debate when Baker refused to say whether he would vote in the election for Republican jak deal who is challenging democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren next month are you going to vote for Jeff deal\nGovernor I'm going to vote for me and I'm going to vote for Karen polio and\nVote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do you expect that when you don't know if you're a vote for\nKaren polio and I'm going to\nVote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do you expect when you don't know if we're going to vote for the guardian ... decision\nI Can't believe otherwise if that's his lieutenant governor ... this is a tough issue for ... really that was an awkward moment for Baker and it became even more so after the debate when he said that he misspoke would vote for the Republican ticket which would include a deal\n... is trying to link Baker to deal and by extension to Trump and\nAnd this does put her in a kind of awkward position this socially liberal anti Trump Republican who says he'll vote for Jeff deal the state's number one Trump supporter the guy who co chaired the Trump campaign and Massachusetts does Baker have a relationship with President Trump no they're not close a Baker didn't vote for Trump as we mentioned he's opposed several of his policies\nBut he argues that when he can work with the Trump Administration when it helps Massachusetts he will but this is a state that voted two to one against Trump um so uh you know Baker has to do a bit of a balancing act year when it comes to the president\nNow Massachusetts has a history of modern Republican governors William Weld pulse solution even Mitt Romney who was governor and passed Romneycare which was the model for Obamacare\nThat's right and Baker is part of that tradition of moderate Republicans that have had success in Massachusetts and across New England for that matter\nThey included people like late Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Olympia Snowe of Maine they were known as you know Rockefeller Republicans fiscally conservative more socially moderate even liberal\nBaker as part of that tradition is fake or does when what is the lesson or is there one for Republicans in other states you know the lesson is that Republicans and Democrats can't overcome this hyper partisanship and work together and get things done I think that's one lesson that's sad bakers brand of moderate Republicanism is increasing increasingly rare\nOnce upon a time it represented a viable wing of the Republican Party that existed across the country but now that wing\nIs on the verge of extinct extinction so I think the lesson is Republican moderates like Charlie Baker increasingly rare\nSaturday Brookes senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston has any thank you my pleasure well a more traditional Republican is gaining ground on his Democratic

Rock Sioux tribe she's also a citizen of the tribe she joined us Daniel thanks for joining us\nThanks for having me Jeremy so you say it's common on reservations for someone not to have a physical street address a explain why that is for people who aren't familiar\nYeah so on the reservation were very spread out community um and due to that\nA lot of people do not live in town ships or areas um communities that have a lot of people in them so actually\nMailboxes are kind of uncommon and because of that most of the community members here hundreds if not thousands of people on Standing Rock used peel box addresses and go to the post office to get their mail and I'm count that\nAs their actual address so um what we're facing here and and what I Believe that the voter suppression is that many people now have to get new ideas with an actual physical residential address\nSo uh so I Want to get to do that and how you're dealing with that issue but first of all do a lot of people who live on reservations tend to vote given that they don't have physical addresses and it just before this year do they vote in big numbers [noise]\nAh yeah you cannot credit US Senator Heidi Heitkamp went in twenty twelve for the U.S Senate seat of North Dakota to the Native American vote where she won\nWith less than three thousand votes and I can tell you here on Standing Rock on the north Dakota side we have twenty seven hundred eligible voters Eighteen and above um that are capable of voting in this election\n'em in twenty fourteen twelve hundred people on Standing Rock voted and so that tells you right there that it's just one tribal nation alone um votes predominantly with one party that could swing an election\nSo what are you trying to do to get trouble citizen voters eligible for this upcoming election given this Supreme Court decision\nSo so do based on the the new law that North Dakota really imposed upon the tribal nations we have to make sure that everyone has identification with their new residential physical address so that entailed either getting them a new ID card that is\nMake sure that everyone has identification\nWith their new residential physical address so that\nIt entailed either getting them a new ID cards that's issued by the tribal government here or we have to provide them supplemental material um whether that's a letter from the travel agency you know tell them they need to bring a utility bill with them if they're going to use their old id\nUm and also making sure people do know their residential address because again like I said people I'm here on the reservation house numbers are not very common a joke that my grandmother was saying is that she actually did a permanent marker and and marked her own house with her own numbers so there you go\n[noise] the Republican controlled state government in North Dakota says this law is about preventing voter fraud or in the city which is over I Want to be easier for states to vote and what are you sort of a\nI think that's comical because you have people now making up their own addresses a because they do not feel like they should go to the sheriff who is also are nine one one

Republicans who have voted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act or making promises that they will continue one of the most popular parts of the law\nMaking sure people with pre existing conditions are able to get and keep their health insurance the Affordable CARE Act is still at risk of being dismantled but a majority of voters wants to protect coverage for pre existing conditions joining us now is Julie Rovner who is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news ...\nHey Jeremy and let's step back a bit first before the Affordable CARE Act was passed in twenty ten who did and who did not have protections for pre existing conditions well\nIf you go from job to job to show that employer provided insurance then you had protections for pre existing condition or either exclusions are being charge more as long as he didn't have a break of more than sixty three days that was a Nineteen Ninety six law that Congress passed\nWhat the Affordable Care act did was that extended it to people who basically left their jobs for their own insurance who wanted to leave to start a business or who were people who work for themselves or or kids graduating from college and going off their parents planned\nThe idea was that people should be able to get insurance regardless of whether they had a pre existing condition and they shouldn't have to pay more for those were the two most important pieces of the pre existing condition protections in the Affordable CARE Act up back\n... if you did leave your job and you did leave your health insurance for a period of time and you did have a pre existing condition diabetes cancer or whatever it may be what does that mean for you could you get insurance\nA period of time and you did have a pre existing condition diabetes cancer or whatever it may be what does that mean for you could you get insurance\nOr possibly not or you might have been able to get insurance but it would cost much more or you might have been able to get insurance but it wouldn't cover your pre existing condition so there were there were a lot of sort of pitfalls if you were trying to buy your own insurance and you had been basically treated for a medical condition sometimes as minor as an acne\nSo at this point with some of the dismantling that has been done of the Affordable CARE Act that pre existing condition protection is still in place right basically if you want health insurance no matter what your pre existing condition is in this country you can get it\nIt is a it is still in place however there is a lawsuit that is pending we're expecting to hear from the judge in Texas [noise] pretty much any time or the lawsuit suggest that because of the tax bill last\nYear that took away the fine for people who don't have health insurance the entire Affordable Care act is now unconstitutional should be struck down\nThe Trump Administration argued that they didn't quite agree with striking down the whole uh for Bill Carrick but maybe they should strike down the preexisting condition protections so even though Congress didn't change it there is still some threat that it could be changed in the court\n... well that brings us to the bigger picture here which is that how can you say that you want to keep that one popular provision of the Affordable CARE Act which is the production for pre existing conditions but you want to get rid of other key provisions does it work if you take little pieces of it away\nWell it it makes it difficult I mean that's basically what the Trump Administration is arguing that the insurance industry said we can't afford to cover people with health problems unless we have a bigger pool of healthy people that's what that tax was about that's why there was an individual mandate the individual mandate is now gone and there is still some concern\nThat only sick people will sign up for individual health coverage because it's expensive or the insurance companies appear to be betting that they're going to continue to hang on to at least they all the people that they have because they're not raising premiums a whole lot for next year or we will see if that pays off we will know more about that in twenty Nineteen about how well that actually\nWorks I mean well let's listen to what President Trump has been saying ah here he is on the campaign trail at a rally in West Virginia last month\nAnd I will always fight for\nPatience with pre existing conditions or you have\n\nYou shouldn't was pre existing conditions or you have to [noise]\nSome\nPeople think that's not a Republican thing to do I don't care and I'll tell you what all of the Republicans are coming into the position now all of them [noise]\n[noise] losing their shoes are safe [noise]\nJulie is he right that all of the Republicans are moving into that position at this point\nWell a lot of them are saying it but there are what they have done suggests otherwise and actually just yesterday the Trump Administration um put out a guidance that allows states to take these are short term plans that don't necessarily cover pre existing conditions\nAnd let people get subsidies for them under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhich is not something that protects pre existing conditions it basically says that OK sick people you're going to be segregated into these other plans in the premiums are likely to go up so it's in what they say and what they do do not match this year we will see whether voters can sort that out [noise]\nWhat about the Affordable CARE Act overall is it likely that if Republicans keep control of both houses of Congress that they're going to try again to repeal the whole thing\nI think that would be likely I think there's some there was some talk that they might try to do it in the lame duck session after the election that seems unlikely because they're going to have the same Congress they had before when they didn't have the votes but if they were to pick up seats particularly in the Senate then I think you would probably see another effort to to do what Congress tried and failed to do and twenty Seventeen\nOther than the pre existing conditions part of the Affordable CARE Act what are the other really popular parts of the law that it would be difficult for Republicans to get rid of\nWell Republicans tried to go after the Medicaid expansion um and that turned out to be surprisingly unpopular I mean who I I don't think I would've guessed and\nTwenty Fifteen that Medicaid would become a big political issue and yet we have medicate now on the ballot in four states I'm about either expanding or protecting an existing expansion so that the popularity of the Medicaid expansion which gave a health insurance to\nDoing you know many millions of people probably around fourteen or Fifteen million people is proving to be popular also so there are other pieces of the Affordable CARE Act that the public likes a lot in fact the only thing that public really didn't like was that individual mandate penalty which Congress got rid of last year\nRight but the question is again whether the the whole thing can stand up if you take away that part of it I guess it has so far\nHas so far that's right\nAnd all the which Congress got rid of last year\nRight but the question is again whether the the whole thing can stand up if you take away that part of it I guess it has so far\nIt has so far that tried in the insurance company behavior suggest that it it will be or they're betting that it will be okay we will have to see what happens in the court\nThe sign up period for a sea health plans starts on November first in for the first time since twenty tend the price of health coverage through the federal marketplaces is down slightly ... what's going on there a\nWell what's that what's going on there is an insurance companies raise their rates so much last year for twenty Eighteen that they have no place else to go they're finally starting to make money so they don't really need to raise rates\nIn some cases they're lowering rates at least slightly um partly that's because under the Affordable CARE Act they're not allowed to raise rates unless they can justify the rate increases which they can't this year and the whole thing and it looks like you know there's a little bit of stability but I should point out it depends where you live\nI'm rates are higher in some places still than in other places sometimes that's because last year's rates didn't go up so much\nI Would also point out that in some states open enrollment has already started in California started October fifteenth\nSo you really need to to check your state to find out when open enrollment is when it ends and what the premiums are looking like\nWhat are you hearing from Democrats as we lived up to the election are you hearing people talk about universal health care as they were a couple of years ago\nWell Democrats are going to have a really big fight I think after the midterm right now they're talking about protecting preexisting conditions um but there is this this sort of Nason to and growing move for a Medicare for all or some kind of universal coverage\nIt's a phrase that means different things to different people but clearly the Affordable CARE Act while it expanded coverage to a lot of people\nDid not do enough about uh doing something about the price of health insurance and the price of health care in general\nAnd the fact that the U.S pays way more than other industrialized countries and I think that's going to be the debate going forward Democrats are going to have to decide whether they want to support and more government run a health plan or whether they can figure out a way to to make the Affordable CARE Act more robust and do something about health care spending in general [noise]\nIf they feel too big on the beach and she'd be news dot org serving Bloomingdale and beyond this is GPA and Eighteen

the ride hailing company lift is bringing electric scooters to Washington DC it's the first east coast city to get scooters from lift but scooters already widespread in the nation's capital with

line and skip already offering rent a boat dock lists electric scooters for short trips around the city Jeff Rudy and ... is the director of the Washington DC department of transportation he joins us now Jeff\nHi Jeremy so how many scooters are there in DC right now approximately what we currently have upwards of two thousand doc was vehicles both a bike and scooters combined and how long have they been around\n[noise] we launched a pilot program about a year ago or to allow these companies to demonstrate to technology here in Washington DC about a year ago and have people been happy with them so far are what are they saying\nWell we've gotten a lot of feedback about their use and certainly there are several people who have a really be be on to use these as a part of their daily commuting experience and others who are using them for a periodic trips to go a long distance or how how far are they going to commute with a scooter\nWhat we've seen a different types of trips in some cases they are short distances in some cases they are a longer connection a distance is getting to and from metro stations for example so there are a number of cases that we have observed or over the past year\nAnd one of the things that a lot of cities have said about these scooters one of the problems that they've seen is that people just leave them on the sidewalks and they clog up the sidewalks and then if you're disabled and you're trying to use your wheelchair and get down the sidewalk you could get stuck because there's there are a bunch of scooters in front are you seeing that they're\n[noise] this is something that we heard very early on during the demonstration period and it's something that we took very seriously in working with\nThe companies to ensure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use a were reflective of those things and that has become something that we're we're working very closely to to enforce and and we see the incidence of those things are decreasing\nAnd do you have a good relationship with the companies are you in contact with them regularly\n[noise] uh we have ah been working with them to collect data information and also to report problems that we hear from from a members of the public here in Washington DC uh and so we have a opened a line of communication with them to ensure that we're sharing information at and that they're sharing information with us\nThey are sharing information with you that is correct so obviously one of the big concerns is safety and I'm just last month there was an SUV that hit and killed a man who was riding a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time\nAnd I'm just last month there was an SUV that hit and killed a man who is writing a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time that somebody has\nDied in an accident in the U.S on on one of these scooters what are you know about that or what can you tell us about that and and how you're making sure that that doesn't happen again it leads to the extent that you can try to stop it from happening again [noise]\nSure well D.C is a city that is committed to vision zero which is a a a strategy that under the leadership of our mayor we've put in place uh to eliminate roadway fatalities in serious injuries and we're doing everything that we can taking it very seriously or to work with\nUh the technology companies that are here to ensure that that their rules and regulations are are are followed by their users we're also taking a number of steps to ensure that we're building the safest possible infrastructure [noise]\nAh it's worth noting that all forms of transportation come with inherent risks and so we're working with in this case with these companies specifically a two to ensure that they are promoting the safest possible a use for their users and that we are\nA informing the public about uh about this new form of technology this new form of mobility that is on the road\nWith one of the things that people have said about the the safety risk of these scooters is that a lot of the people who ride them not just in Washington but all over the country aren't wearing helmets and that they're they're out on the roads with cars but they're not wearing helmets or do they have to wear helmets in DC\n[noise] currently the law and DC are for helmets is is limited to individuals who are sixteen or under or some of the companies as you may know do a giveaway helmets and they strongly incentivize a riders to use helmets and and that's something that that I think companies are are thinking about as a as this technology moves forward\nAnd what about a government or what about the district of Columbia are are you thinking or are people in D.C thinking about putting in a law that says that people have to wear helmets if they're writing these rented scooters\n[noise] you know I Can't speak to what lawmakers may or may not do with respect to changing the the current helmet law certainly we are always encouraging both cyclists and people who are using scooters or to to be as safe as possible and that that includes wearing helmets\nSo you get to see the data as you said what are you finding about how this is changing transportation in DC is it having a big effect\n[noise] it's it's very early to tell what what the impact will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling to\nIn a big effect [noise] it's it's very\nEarly to tell what what the impact will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling into to trips taken that's really why we have decided to do this in an incremental approach to allow uh kept a number of these vehicles on the street\nTo observe their use patterns but also to to really a dive deep into the data to to get a better understanding of of how the public is interacting with them\nAnd right now the cap number is what the cat number is four hundred per company okay and so now we're talking about with the addition of lift are currently in a district there there are five companies five companies Jeff you've been in Washington now for a number of years\nHow big is the addition of electric scooters ... rental electric scooters compared to any other changes that you've seen in transportation including by the way over and left over the years\nI I'm Glad that you mentioned uber and Lyft because there was a time when that technology first emerged and came into the market uh that that people were asking a lot of the same types of questions that we are now asking about a duck was bikes and scooters\nThis is a significant change it's one that provides a new mobility opportunity and\nUnder the leadership of our mayor Muriel Bowser it's something that we have a embrace but have done so in a very incremental way to ensure that are that the technology is utilized a in a safe way for the residents and visitors of the district of Columbia\nThere are still a lot of cities in this country that do not allow the scooters and I'm In one of them right now what would your advice be to other cities that are considering whether to allow Douglas a electric rentals scooters on the roads\nMy advice is really to to listen to the public we very deliberately opened up a comment period where we got lots of feedback and lots of information from the public uh from really all across the spectrum and that's something that we take very seriously we analyze it and we use it to inform the policymaking going forward\nThat jeopardy and who is director of the Washington DC department of transportation Jeff thank you thank you Jeremy\nThis year's school shooting in Parkland, Florida in Santa Fe Texas has led

how about Patrick McGovern he\nFounded a company called international data corporation back in Nineteen sixty four it produced magazines like computer world Mac world and PC World and similar publications around the world\nBut government who died in twenty fourteen became a billionaire as the company grew and author Glenn risking has just written a book about him called future forward Glenn risking welcome to hear now\nThanks Jeremy it's great to be here so Patrick McGovern not a household name but very important guy who was he\nWell he was the entrepreneur and visionary who started a company called international data group I D G and what he saw was that the information technology revolution was getting started in the early sixties it was slow and\nSteady but he saw something bigger happening and over those years he decided that somebody needed to tell the story of this revolution there was one thing to be\nThe bill gates or the Thomas Watson junior who made things the software in the hardware but somebody needed to chronicle what was going on and that was his mission\nSo he created computer world magazine computer world and Mac world as well\nBe created actually nearly three hundred publications around the world over the course of fifty years running the company but yes the first publication was computer world\nWhich became the Bible of the information technology industry what was in it what what would you find in computer world well it was it was news weekly news it was product reviews and things like that but mostly it was\nTaking a look at the people and players in the industry\nIt was it was news weekly news it was product reviews and things like that but mostly it was\nTaking a look at the people and players in the industry the companies that were moving and shaking um they were big uncovering IBM in the late sixties into the seventies when they were the eight hundred pound gorilla in the in the industry space [noise] um and as it moved along as the industry changed the personal computer was created in the Nineteen eighties\nComputer world would would be the newspaper of record so to speak it was kind of the New York times\nOf the computer industry I was also thinking about it in comparison to Bloomberg which you know people on Wall street they've all got these Bloomberg terminals which they pay a lot of money for just to get information so they have the latest information is that the same kind of thing who is he talking to with computer world and Mac world\nWell computer early Mac world would be slightly different audiences Mac world was really aimed right away at the apple market and back in it started on the day they release the Macintosh computer ... investors or who this would have been the computer world was aimed early on at data processing managers deep team managers who morphed into\nWhat we now think of is ... chief information officer as\nIt wouldn't there were no terminals\nI'm set up like Bloomberg this was strictly a newspaper today obviously it's strictly on line but you know over the course of those three or four decades computer world was a print publication and it was aimed at at offering technology people an insight into what the products were who is using them how they were using them\nAnd they made the big leap which was an important leap and showing that these guys were not just techies\nHidden behind glass walls these people were going to contribute big time to the business because technology was going to drive things and you worked there a computer I did I joined in Nineteen eighty three at the time didn't know a computer from a washing machine\nAnd if I could turn on the on switch I always had\nA never dreamed of getting involved in this technology industry but I got a job there at a time when jobs were a little bit scarce and ended up just loving it because something really exciting what's happening I started interviewing Bill Gates and Steve Jobs\nBefore the New York times and Wall Street journal did so I was you know right there as I say in the book at the tip of my keyboard things were happening and I stayed there for seven years at which time during which time I got to know pat McGovern [noise] so what was it about him that was so special\nWell there's lots of visionary slots entrepreneurs out there who've done great things but ... had a very unique style\nSo what was it about him that was so special\nWell there's lots of visionaries lots of entrepreneurs out there who've done great things but ... had a very unique style of management and leadership\nWhich is what the book is about that he saw the world differently he didn't need to be in the spotlight what he wanted was to fulfill a mission and one of the keys to him to fill fulfill this mission was to treat his employees around the world in a way that most companies did\nAnd this was a guy or for example\nAt the holidays he would go around to every office in the United states we're talking about five thousand people at the time he would go to every desk\nHe would meet and greet every employee he knew if you would work there before and each senior year the year before he not only remember your name he knew your wife's name he knew how many kids had [noise]\nHe would congratulate you on some project that you did and he would thank you for the contributions you are making to the company and then he would hand you a holiday card which was stuffed with cash holiday bonuses and people were blown away by this I was blown away by this when it happened I heard that it was happening but when you don't believe\nIt until you actually shows up at your desk and this need this desire to to make a connection to every employee I mean I Can't think of another CEO who did\nThat one it's great in terms of fostering a a really nice atmosphere for the worker but he was also able to make a lot of money and and you point out you go through a number of business lessons from pat in the governor and and one of them is that he would allow ideas to develop he would\nYou say he would give people what three quarters of losses until he finally put a stop to things but basically he'd give people a long time or to try things out to experiment\nOne of ... one of the actual corporate values the ten corporate values of the company is let's try it\nAnd his idea was that great ideas we're gonna emanates from everywhere and anywhere inside the company um if somebody was smart enough to come up with the idea could make a case for the idea he said let's try it and he would give you some funding and he would let you go with it\nUm and it created numerous publications that created numerous opportunities um one of the great stories that came from that attitude was the for dummies books\nWhich are now those are from him those were originally from ... dos for ... for dummies absolutely there was a they started a book division and they had this gentleman named John Kilcullen who come into the division wasn't doing well at all he remembered\nAbsolutely there was a they started a book division and they had this gentleman named John Kilcullen who come into the division wasn't doing well at all he remembered a story about a friend\nWho was at a computer store back in the eighties and ask the clerk listen I Need a book about this MS dusting you know but I don't know anything it's gotta be something like ... for dummies\nAnd kill colored remembered that title suggested to McGovern let's do a series of books about this\nAnd McGovern thought well we're insulting our readers if we're calling them dummies and kill Collins said no we're doing is this is pre YouTube pre Internet we can give them really reasonable instructions on how to be smart about technology because technology is complicated\nSo they went with that and the for dummies books became this remarkable global brands there's I mean literally two or three thousand titles in print they other\nThing that was interesting uh as I was reading your book is that he early on this is decades ago really took an interest in China he would go over there you would have needed to people he would eat all kinds of crazy things when he would do business deals are that that that would impress his a Chinese colleagues because he was willing to try things like that\nWell like I said pat was a visionary in one of the places that his vision took took place was in China\nHe showed up there in Nineteen Seventy eight he actually got off a plane where he wasn't legally allowed to ... there were no diplomatic relations with China at the time he somehow talk this way into the city of Beijing which was called the king then\nAny wandered around the streets he had one day to do this and can only imagine the six foot three inch mass of American in the dark business suit wandering around the streets of Beijing\nLooking in bookstores looking at what people were doing and realizing that there was number one massive population and number two they were starved for information and there was going to be an opportunity here that he was going to get into well before
