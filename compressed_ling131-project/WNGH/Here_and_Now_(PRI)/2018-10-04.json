Cohen pleaded guilty\nIs that but did authorize a payment of a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment\nWill story Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure she joined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about more than the night she says she slept with Trump\nEverybody wanted me to write a tell all and I was like I really don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that at big you know Ninety seconds and uh back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it'd be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that a an interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I Want it to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSuddenly like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nAnd like I said how things transpired and why they happen the way they did in the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still show that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I read\nIt might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you're talking about at the beginning you grew up in\nBaton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food ah you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called a liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you are able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know [noise]\nUm basically what I just said that\nI don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a feeling for\nWhere I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more\nSpeech or dance or um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I was and I would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid but um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than the hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted it to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy with you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out\nBut then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and I just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell the my side of the stories of people to understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward and\nI just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen [noise]\nUm I think we're about to find out on what is the December twelve\nHe was the kind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it you know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he had messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that\nI also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean and I met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that I was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of names I have a pretty thick skin being\nIn the adult entertainment business you know but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal um\nWe're worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this non disclosure now my fear lies mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now I Do I have to they're awesome [laughter] but what is that what is that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel on I was used to be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted I've gotten used to it and we become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describing this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they're harbored this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask by over compensating\nAs you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years\nUm as it shaped the way that you perceive to him at the beginning at all [noise]\nNo not not much I stills stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the adult business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have company is and people at a high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very privileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still holds true today\nHow would you describe him today [noise]\nKnow I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least an eye out with him he can make complete sentences\nThere's a report in the wall Street Journal this week that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair with him\nAll Street Journal this week uh the alleged the Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair within ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday I had just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nActually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news that where you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to [noise]\nUh actually the exact opposite from around here for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over\nAnd over do not following politics closely\nThings yes but I'm not reading the news and the news stories and specially thing away from anything about me\nWhere you're coming out with this book just a month before the midterm elections do you want this to influence the way that people vote\nThat was not my intention at all that was literally how fast can you get that how fast can get print that how fast can this happened it was not a strategy at least not on my part maybe the publisher smarter than I thought but I don't think so I don't think it was actually part of a master plan\nThat in itself is a wonderful gift for you are and someone that you love to take off and go

little hope that we're finding each other again Denny Mason joins us from ... in San Francisco welcome and congratulations\nThank you it's wonderful to be on the show well how did you come to this story this time in history it'd be a very different different novel on a psychiatrist and I was very interested in\nSpared psychiatric history in the Nineteen twenties and was writing about a psychiatrist at the time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors I have a ... that involved the first World War [noise]\nAnd so I began to read about the medical experience in the first World War and as I was reading that I began to encounter this anecdote of how the ... army was so early prepare that\nThey began to recruit a medical students sometimes dentist sometimes veterinarians to serve a very important roles and fuel hospitals on the front tending to knock the numbers of men [noise]\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school\nAnd all of a sudden to imagine this colleague across time a hundred years ago leaving his medical training and being asked to to foreign medical responsibilities that he was on her for something to that resonated with me and the place I was in at that time\nWell I mean he he's issued an\nArmy issued medical manual that offers advice on building latrines soothing blisters with whale oil and providing moral instructions a soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when he gets there is he hears about what was it might be teeming with maggots just horrifying and churning clumps they teens they stir like embers these are life as well on every layer of clothing and every stitch and seen\nThey came out upon our comes grainy like wet meal just\nDisgusting because of these ... you know these moist dressings and amputations which he had no idea how to do and enter this non who teaches him all of this where did you find her origin\nIn an amputation which he had no idea how to do and enter this nun who teaches him all of this where did you find her\nSo originally I hadn't imagine having the role that you eventually had in the story I had thought that was just sort of arrived at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical staff there there'd be a nurse would credit background role but much like ...\nI found when I encounter she ended up picking over the story and she has very forceful force in the book and I realized eventually but she was going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first\nDealing with Lucy is who again has arrived at this place he doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with headphones and amputate the split this leg this elbow that for arm that I'm over there we can let the and this is soldier loose just ask smelling like that she says he'll be dead by morning\nDon't worry you didn't do it we keep them warm if he wakes up we tell him he's home because his father you call him son\nYou know right there just a snapshot of\nWho she is and the Washington Post right she's your most irresistible creation actresses all over Hollywood should be jockeying to play her part in the inevitable movie adaptation were you thinking cinematic Lee because it is I felt as if I was seeing a a film as well as reading a story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly cinematic we I think that I'm very drawn to visual images at the time period offers up some extraordinary physical settings\nBecause this takes place on the Eastern Front it's different than the world war one that I ... in the trenches and the muddy field so ... of Belgium [noise] this is different these are these large landscapes across which there's this encounter not only\nWith these modern military armies but also very traditional one soldiers on horseback ... glances and this is part of what drew me into the story these very rich visual images from the time\nBut loses in fact at one point is lost in the woods and then she's in the middle of a battle on the front it's kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nOf the accounts that I read and I'd say many if not most of the kinds of the war accounts of battle\nAnd in that moment when Lucia stumbles into this classic Russian classic advance and a group of Hungarian has\nThe kinds of the war accounts of battle and in that moment when Lucia stumble into this classic rushing costs like advance and a group of Hungarian has ours he realizes that despite the fact that at that point he's been on the front for almost two years he hasn't really seen war itself and\nThe rest of\nThe book really looks at this other aspect of for what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals what's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their mind as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was this psychiatric torment [noise] they called it nervous shock\nSure so as a psychiatrist I've been aware that one of the signal injuries of World War one\nIs shell shocked and yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds\nThat couldn't be seen is that some new kind of virus is is a reaction to this new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial thought that there was something about\nThe high explosives that was used during the war is actually sending microscopic particles through the Gulf of the scan it into the brain and causing\nAn injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this [noise]\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure\nAnd here's what we see Lucia is our doctor mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret than nine is using this as a human being whose suffering\nIs this something because you said you relate to a lot to lose this do does this something that yeah transition you went to the doctor\nIs I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and then when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into wards and meet people\nIs very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the\nAnd and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon\nThere's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact of them on on their family and for those people who care for them [noise] and that increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is something that moves just go through\nA we just want to touch on the some of the absurdist notions there was\nThe ... old professor in Vienna who steals and alleged murder made from a museum because he wants to X ray to see what it is enter a young scientist female scientist by the name of Marie Curie [laughter] who helps with that there is a staffer at the field hospital who was told he had manly hands\nAnd because he thinks they're special he doesn't want to wash them with this caustic soap so he gets dysentery and dies is replaced by another soldier with the same name there's an absurdity to war\nRight and probably to every conflict but particularly to this conflict ... bureaucracy was so expensive and so entrenched\nWhen we all chip in what we can we do the important work of long form journalism\nThat many
