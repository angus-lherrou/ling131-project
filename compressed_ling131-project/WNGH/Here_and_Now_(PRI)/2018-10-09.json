it here and now the twenty twenty cents is is at the center of a legal battle the Trump Administration wants to include a question about whether the resident answering the census is a U.S

even though he told Congress that the Justice Department hit us\nDo you answer questions about it under oath\nInternal documents show the secretary Ross pushed for that question even though he told Congress that the Justice Department had asked for it the White House wants to stop Ross from having to testify today a panel of judges are reviewing that request NPR national correspondent ... is following this story he joins us now I ...\nI always say you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part release in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and I really key documented said internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as commerce secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty cents is and it it he says\nThat he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to the twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became eat the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks\nIs this person a citizen of the United states it's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration gave her why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least once a thing about his reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department which is representing a secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the law suits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intent is mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration I said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act they wanted responses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial and ... language minorities I've just said\nThis is from a citizenship question to better and for section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities arrived essentially took her to make sure those groups have the right to vote 'em that the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey at 'em and uh the job ... says that data is not enough is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include a communication between a Kris Kobach the currents are Republican gubernatorial candidate\nAs well as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross stew addict citizenship question and his concern\nWas that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted\nIn census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census all\nOf this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty cents as it's going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what is a massive undertaking\nOh they are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross edible at stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau is facing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play important part for live households and may not be comfortable or don't have access to Internet and so they will be paper\nAnd so this is a really

Justin Paul hello there even loans and hello\nBench I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIs not directly based on something had happened to my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and he passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him and they actually were a myself included and\nI was struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like a our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves and the tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that\nFurther well but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling themselves about how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan hands into your\nHe presented kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan Hanson and so he they think their best friends and poor Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson this idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and\nAn entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well I um he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because he can't keep them a lot of the\nHow you were able to put those feelings the new song\nWhat's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music\nTo get across these characters\nNo it's true that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how you take the would become sort of temple moments on the musical how do you take that and translate it into a book\nIt is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book allows us to get inside these characters had to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want to be zone experience and to live on its own\nNow any a sweaty palms this is very special to people all these characters and especially Evan Hansen really means something to young people\nAny uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really mean something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In Evan first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and then also had fled hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being what do you ever becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotionally I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge\nGiven the popularity and the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more\nThis notion that you're writing about suicide guy I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize that's\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of there is in a in a mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's there's a him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey only give anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYeah this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine\nMore about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it is that\nDo you really want to know more about countered you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does and it was important to us that it not feel mano causal\nI'm like there's this one thing that that um you know isn't the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times of what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media\n... and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that [noise]\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ...

it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point the our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that we're going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\n[noise] one of the things that you and your colleagues had no ... is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees eye and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shore is if Greece up pretty high margin is quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that\nWe've been impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them had grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange with populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the fall of ... they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece was workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes
