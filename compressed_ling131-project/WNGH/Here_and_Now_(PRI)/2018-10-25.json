seven six to ...\nNuts yeah you're on it on okay good good [noise]\nI'm Dr Andy ... with the also a research Institute and we are at the edge of a pit that we're excavating dating from modern stuff right at the top all the way down to potentially maybe Fifteen thousand years ago some of the earliest occupation\nThat only in Florida but in the new world wow what kind of just getting to the the good stuff as we get through the earliest Holocene material and get into the end of the ice age the end of the the terminal places the material will be looking at things and the twelve to fourteen and it's like I said as much as Fifteen thousand year old range [noise]\n\nThey're lined up shovels sent he pushed across the floor ... thousands of years with every layer careful exacting work you never

interest sharp wounded up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing again in the five six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal\nAnd as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it or Tom said perhaps corn cob a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old ... here but it's conceivable\nIt's MORNING it started to have some structure to it Tom said perhaps corn cob a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old ... here but it's conceivable so so that'll be

making of fame during\nThe ... this was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI Can't touch something ten thousand you know or I go to school\nThat wasn't my head that Dr heading who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one foot and there's so many ways to mess up here [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be artifacts are most beneficial to archaeologist they reveal their stories best when they're found where they were left and\nStorms like recent hurricane Michael can disturb that\nIf you stand in a place long enough you can feel the same ... a little bit and it's caused you know snow into problems and agitation ...\nDo you think that's the rain as you are you shake your fist at the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they are in place and not currently excavated and that's really why we were so very concern is that we have an open excavation pit almost a meter deep with soils that have not seen the light of day for the better part of nine thousand years we've we've made it vulnerable\nVery concerned is that we have an open exploration pit almost a meter deep with soils would have not seen the letter day for the better part of nine thousand years we've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing and we we are awful awful lot\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by a man who devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologist Kelvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's what some of the most important earliest points were made\nKelvin Jones isn't he the one who got a wheelbarrow of loan delivered to his home he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he ... the Jackson has and he's the one who said\nWait a second this there is more than dirt is part of this ancient burial site yeah yeah\nThey had a delivery of Sirte and within the ... there were artifacts\n[noise] that is archaeologist Barbara clauses of Florida public archaeology network\nAnd we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of lung leading to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephant one bigger than the others [noise] okay we walked\nAcross that vast lawn and there it is I mean how how high near would you say this ...\nThis is the tallest up to seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall\nThese mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound this\nSite is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mound builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain and hot when that person past they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains and their home would be burned and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to\nKind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn holes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nUs climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pie or is it\nIf you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral\nPie or is that it's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today to definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nBut we are going to climb the stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go\nAre there are native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who lived here for\nThe descendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that so we are not climbing the [noise] the wouldn't stairs up the mound um which is\nCovered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty [laughter] I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand a de these mouths and we're right on top now these mounts have weathered uh women a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the mound and then you have the open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains\nHere we are ready on top of the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community would get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living this was strategically", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "25"}
