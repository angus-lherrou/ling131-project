I was in pieces when things would happen at seven and eight and nine and ten that were just too much for me to handle I learned to send myself out of the room that terror was not there and the sadness was not there\nThe rage was not there and the part of me that was the taskmaster could stay and do the tasks that were required and as I started my early career I was still able to send out the parts of me that were overwhelmed luckily when I was twelve years old\nI found a stage I went to a public school and the San Fernando valley and they had a theater arts department and I did my first scene when I was twelve years old and that\nSomething cleared bell rang everything was quiet\nI could hear myself something that happens when you're really in a craft\nAnd you're not in your body anymore so that when hand in hand with coming out of being in the kind of traumatic childhood place that I was in but it was acting thing comes civil the test\nWith coming out of being in the kind of traumatic childhood place that I was in but it was acting\nThing comes civil the TV show based on the true story of a young woman with multiple personalities\nThey were you\nCan do anything I can do anything I wouldn't [laughter]\nCourse your phenomenally talented but of course you're going to be able to play that person because you've divided so much of yourself up\nI didn't ...

experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happens when they look up at the sky daytime nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking up will help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other and it's still just a tiny bit more connected around this planet\nSo you know some people will look up the sky and they will fill love they'll fill whole fails fill some people may feel afraid they may feel wonder are expensive\nAnd how they express that is what we want to capture\nAnd we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to\nTake these photos and you've got to put them up but we're going to

looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of margins guy period yeah nice guy and a nice guy well but but in the sky period and and in the last couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in a city is disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut I I guess the thing is what do you see\nAnd and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and being more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are where even seen our impact\nOn this planet and so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that is is our atmosphere is this planet that warms us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change\n[noise] well I Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nTo do we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do in my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet\nOh is this connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster we really care about each other but that carried only happens\nWhen we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have [noise] I actually\nHave a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ... that we have that's completely free we're calling it a sky feet at right is this guy selfie [laughter] and that sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions that we have you because you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years so let's\nI when I hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of of a gun\nThat it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of of a governor has in terms of\nHuman biology at health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really changed fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form and what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference [noise]\nThird now a a number or a small number but a number of African American women who have gone into space\nBut you'll always be the first

our\n... is an emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana where they were three deaths and Rodney a year in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight where we took a direct hit the when it hit us it was ... at a high cat three little cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm hold a lot of places and people will realize that they stole it does affect people that deep inland\nAnd when you've got stole all of this magnitude and moving as fast as it did it held together a lot better and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you do I understand your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged the pretty much it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part on my roof often we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYeah well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and if it's the damage is it just off the scales bad and buildings Dale almost every country has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize shut down\nOne of the county appraiser Carlin the cartel the Tampa Bay to be in that she guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county were damaged she's using tax rules an aerial pictures and say is that you sent\nA sense that we ... we had a\nClue to go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plush are completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr no with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd that after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do\nYou do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do I can tell you or the critically they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nWell what what are some of these is because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd this happened because people don't realize fiber does ruin the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just that was so much to breed though they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped and so they were not transmitting\nNot you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to find a study on storm response failed in the state legislature twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level a emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issues we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\n[noise] I don't know if it is so much climate change as it is is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast riot town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental thing that uh this is a direct result of warming Mars\nAnd and I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level it's not a course of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee that this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell I ride in the Andes and they're in Jackson County and Mariana Florida we wish you the best case thank you very much\nPart of the

there's also a bright green one which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Robert they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are so what if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian pair and I went up for you right there\nThey are very crunchy very tart\nSweet also these are best eaten raw Timmy and Asian pair tastes like\nA pair meeting with a water chestnut and it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juice scene is and\nWonderful and salads wonderful graded also Bartlett another very common for riding very sweet red and green as well they are ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is that they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also boss pairs same deal very earthy flavor and ... parents have any long gated neck which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have one of ... we did it seems so hard\nI'm really glad you said that because I\nAm going to absolutely show you how\nWrong you are okay All right here's what I did ready I peeled pair but I kept the stem on yeah okay I peeled it okay with me is making naked and I took a couple of sugar ... and a couple of white wine and two cups of water and I boil them\nI could add a cinnamon stick I could add some fresh ginger to that\nI let it cook down that's called the simple syrup\nWhite wine and two cups of water and I boil them I could add a cinnamon stick I could add some fresh ginger to that I let it cook down that's called the simple syrup mhm I place my naked as you call them pairs into the syrup\nAnd I let them cook for about twenty five to thirty minutes and what happens is the parent releases its juice into the syrup\nAnd the pair than cooks in this week delicious ginger syrup it can be made well ahead of time it keeps in syrup you can use that for breakfast and you could eat that as part of a salad\nBut you certainly could serve that for dessert you don't need whipped cream it's healthy it's light and I think it's so refreshing\nRight now but the other thing about Paris is that they swing both ways they're savory and they're also clearly sweet [laughter] so I made a savory salad that's a little bit different than a normal\nPear salad I took 'em in this case I Believe I use a Bartlett pair my peel did I put a tiny
