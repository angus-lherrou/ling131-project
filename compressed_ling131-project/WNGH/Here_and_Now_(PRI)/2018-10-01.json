he has not put any limitations on that investigation but Democrats say that is not true we're joined now by NPR's lead politics editor Domenico Montanaro them into good to have you thanks for being on\nA thank you for having me so there are questions from Democrats about the scope of this investigation and who exactly is dictating where it can go can you give us any clarity about who the FBI will or will not be talking to\nWell we know who they have talked to a little bit so far uh they have talked to ... for example one of the\nOther uh people who are alleging sexual misconduct on the part of Brett Kavanaugh while she was in college with Brett Kavanaugh at a party where they both for drinking a and so we know that they've at least spoken to her we have heard that\nThe White House would prefer the FBI not to speak to Julie sweat neck for example who is another person who had come out\nA saying that she had seen sexual misconduct on Brett Kavanaugh's part part when they were in high school\nBut we don't know exactly how far the FBI is going to go or they only have a week's time are less than that at this point so it's unclear just how many interviews they can possibly do to get it wrapped up in that amount of time so we'll see where that was going\nOne of Kevin ... friends at Yale says that he will submit a statement to the FBI today that that will describe cabin on as a

I was working in the place and I was told to go to new Scotland yard and get some testing done with don't just Davis because I was doing very well often find people from close circuit television and I didn't have a clue to ... to that point\nReally ... in ... and how does it work for you if you see a little bit of someone's face like the un ears sticking out from beneath the cap for instance or or an eyebrow is that enough\nIs leaves you'd be amazed last year ... from the back of the head from ... but those are\nThe very strange ability but when it when it comes off you are very excited the thing is every single time I\nLook a fight song that nothing is ... ... if someone is going to be in a row style and you also have on well it's a ... put me in a room full of people and pitches last amazing you like that we love it and those who prepping all just a\nIt's not a bird and so in other words I see thousands of faces everyday to I wouldn't want to remember each of the details that I pick up\nIt can be a burden speak on it because you could be walking down the street and someone would walk into what would you they might smile she think oh I Know that person because you recognize the face but you don't actually know them sue gum satellites and then like\nA a don't we know you if the problem is because if you walk in the same area qualified and you'll see the fights you recognize device huh do you have\nShe knows them soup and salad so and then like a a don't we know you if the problem is because if you walk in the same area qualified and you'll see the fights you recognize that device huh\nDo you have to commit the face or the details of the face to memory or is it involuntary\nA seem voluntary um even when you have to try you can just be walking down the street you'll see that face so many times I recognized him years later\nAnd you didn't know this until you were working with the police it as a as a grown man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a kid that oh my gosh I've got this strange talent\nNot us to talk to the correct or did not have a clue awful that everybody could do to self though it was a natural but let's see if everyone and so I didn't have a clue but the second to found out what a super recognized off doing the test with those types of the question of a state that's ...\n... ... you are as you say took these skills to your police work and let's talk about this case of the Russian spy poisoning or insult very of course you were not involved in this investigation but take us inside that department how would this have played out behind the scenes\nSo I ... I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to ... ... that's a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would not go look for some people or is no we've gotten to people from the folks each\nSo would you use many different techniques like links the resulting discussion Web I Would take time for the folks each until we notice and normally scientists and appearing and they'll stay because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that we've got some memory and then if we see that person to get enough of it if the ... and then we can start seeing is that the person weather can full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there's some estimates that there's something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you is a detective in ... in that unit\nI think is actually bringing his estimate about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nThey know that said recognize you and I wish I was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps are pages of suspects the oath I Would not always looking for the suspect sometimes ... victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to really help solve problems fun people well what kind of cases did you crack\nA very good well most of his mouth who has a one of ... and he was believed to be out of the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ...\nIt could well morph there was a mouse who has a one of ... most wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... just to suspect I'd never met them before but I've seen a picture of them full solve going around in the ... you give me ... we lost at the same\nAnd he'd been stopped several times other police officers who hadn't recognizing the on London's most wanted but luckily struggle I mean ... when we took him back for fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell them how you found them\nWe did get actual often we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe you me for that one sided I ah like the ... is a very unique skill\nJosh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think they just sort of a night we think that super recognizes a less than one percent of the population very very few people have this ability we found some very small differences in the way that the brain function\nAnd I think that's the sort of direction that the research may be going in future\n[noise] is it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think is a different function is is quite an interesting question that because\nPeople have done research on a world champion soup and memorize those who've ... hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested that face recognition of let's say they found that they would not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing so to streams of numbers in words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that these specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact almost the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people if they've been very very small communities\nNeeding to know a large number of faces wouldn't so being very necessary so so that sort of strange situation as far as the ... and it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associated with\nOther aspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly too in the super recognizes to become very very\nYou see how you said with other aspects of object recognition somehow change slightly to in these super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis less less notes the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces is well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said with very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut with low quality images which most CCTV footage is\nA human beings still beat computers I think in the future will well the situation is going to be it's the best algorithms working with the ... humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions what are the limitations\nBecause what you hear makes a

on how to use the body's immune system to attack cancer Allison is the chair of immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform\nAt the University of Texas empty Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr posters welcome and congrats to you and your colleague on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for Jim for empty arson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world will tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer well Dr Alison\nIs really dedicated his entire life and his research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHis uh maintenance I was to understand how to block of protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably at Dr level [laughter]\nWell in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells\nAnd those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases and part of that break process\nAlso impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Alison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for it\nAnd developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer and so what has that meant for cancer treatment in general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery\nChemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites\nAnd two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree mad\nAnd allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes and you know therapy well we've seen spectacular results including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at Indiana or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nThe Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer\nThey'll die of cancer this year how hopeful are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combination of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize award really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr

independence so they could be here for some time well let's hear from one of the activists that you spoke with this is a man named Roger Espanol who was shot by police\nIn the guy he was actually he

people in the region are split on the issues so there are\nMany people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those\nDo not um how how divided Catalonia [noise]\nWatching

a loss of the analysts who look at the situation though they believe\nWill thing this increase is the bitterness between both sides and that is certainly you nailed it divided front Joe Santa could

that we're into fall and the weather is a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy\nHey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you how simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it isn't solved deep fry at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you\nStart a fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk walk the ideal shape for\nHolding the oil knows flattering it's got the high side you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil we want to keep a it's a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right\nSo I had my walk I also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nAdd about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Crisco you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix and I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred and I'm always a jeopardy type it around through twenty five three twenty\nRight there I can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred\nAnd I'm always a jeopardy type it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch alright are good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces\nAnd I'm marinated it overnight in really good butter milk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender ISIS chicken it at some of that is ... flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I just it well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's got a great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another ... OK okay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first okay and you're going to do the size then you're going to do the best pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it you've got a little bit of money here and some lemon so though so you would yeah that and I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken fried show yeah and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting has really brings out the sweet flavor lives there but it's subtle to kind of pulls it out that's\nFavorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left over oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown\nBut the idea behind having\nNot greasy food is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's okay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic\nOf Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in ...\nSo this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go just gone\nAnd so I saw ginger little catch upsetting to me and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nSo you fry it you cool it down and they try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy knows that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy and is\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger and I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and\nWhich gives you a thousands of hours of\nPBS shows all the masterpiece dramas including the new season of poll dark all the seasons of Downton

children who are homeless is way up\nThe Seattle Times recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen and Steve was the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the district trying to figure all this out currently welcome\nYeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there in ... county\n[noise] we definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students in the world just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families they see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more\nUntil unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you're working minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nHere incomes going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that\nAre leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNo you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community as what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath\nThem and it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes or no for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go with out until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nYou noticed that and then what do you do do you sit\nOut lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nYou noticed that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter]\nBecause they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out and my community and I do drive ... to go to the address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expects me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis used in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\n[noise] it's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different\nBut I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need so what kind of help or are you getting [noise]\nWe um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to have\nThe resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations\nI Believe a vessel we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have systems set up where we have a resource bus we drive\nWe'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them closing that they need sometimes ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need and we have a food programs\nDrops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program\nWhere we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis that's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team at Bethel it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness\nIn school or eighty seven percent more likely to drop out of high school and as you well know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with through class work\n[noise] it's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students um their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be [noise]\nI'll just give you an example I had one young man I was
