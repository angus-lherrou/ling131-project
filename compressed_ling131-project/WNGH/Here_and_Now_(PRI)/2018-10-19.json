White House correspondent for Bloomberg high told him hey there until they let me start with you what is your sense of how conflicted the White House is uh on getting tough on Saudi Arabia as more and more disturbing details come out every day about what might have happened to show the\nYeah the White House is really being sort of forced to take a stuffed a tough stance in part because members of Congress members of the president's own party are speaking out about about what happened in\n... in Turkey against is a journalist who uh is an American resident we've heard the president and people in the white I'll say oh this is an an an American citizen and you know this happened in another country but this is someone who was working as a journalist and in America\nAnd someone who was expressing his freedom of speech and apparently was murdered for it by\nA government officials for a U.S ally so the president has said that he is going to wait for the Saudis and the Turks to get to the bottom of this with an investigation uh but it's looking more and more like he's going to be pressured into taking action\nBy Congress we saw that happened last year with Russia the president did not want to sanction Russia you wanted to have a better relationship with them or putting but\nA Congress in a bipartisan overwhelming vote passed new sanctions against election meddling targeting Russian President was forced\nA relationship with them reporting but a Congress in a bipartisan overwhelming vote passed new sanctions against the election meddling targeting Russian President was forced to sign it and it's looking more and more like the president sees that fate and is trying to position himself as a potentially being tougher on salary on the Saudis for what happened in Turkey\nWell and that's one of the reasons the president is is so conflicted about this is because the U.S has a very important strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia is very important economic relationship they own a lot of US government bonds or or big oil producer a they invest heavily in U.S companies there there's a lot at stake here\nYou're listening to hear it down [noise]\n\nSupport for ... comes from our monthly Sistine years\nIf you're already a gp sustain or you know how great it feels to help provide fun informative and inspiring programs to make a difference in your community and beyond\nIf you're not a sustain are yet to take a few minutes right now to set up an ongoing monthly contribution at G.

scheduled across the rest of the country a powerful local police chief was killed by gunmen in Kandahar general Scott Miller commander of us and NATO forces in Afghanistan\nOf the country a powerful local police chief was killed by gunmen in Kandahar general Scott Miller commander of us and NATO forces in Afghanistan narrowly escaped injury it marked the first time since the two thousand one us led invasion that the top American commander in Afghanistan has been involved in an incident like this\nJoining us now is the b._b._c. chief international correspondent leads to said she's in Kabul, Afghanistan [noise]\nAt least there have been a number of recent Taliban attacks in the run up to this election but this one in Kandahar was especially brazen what did you say to you about the security situation there\nThis was the most devastating attack a by the Taliban against\nAh the senior leadership in Afghanistan taking place in Kandahar a critical critical province of the former heartland of the Taliban they still have a network of sympathizers still have the ability to carry out this a kind of spectacular attack\nThe wife now the senior leadership including the powerful police chief general I'll do it runs back some may some have raised questions about his his tactics send in trying to improve security in the province of there's no denying he was lynched in\nIn bringing a better security and stability to this area and not just to come to her but to the entire so so it really\nHas sent a shiver right across Afghanistan and happening so soon before these critical parliamentary polls we're still waiting to hear all the details about how this was done but we understand was\nCommitted by a member on his security team a young bodyguard underlining again the ability of the Taliban to somehow persuade new bride\nOr encourage young Afghans to act for them right in the ... of the the but the Afghan or authority administration\nAnd it does come just two days before the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan do you think that it's related to that\n[noise] the almost strike whenever they can they have vowed to attack these polls they verge of Afghan citizens like teachers and students not to vote to not to put themselves up in harm's way\nThey have said that they will try very hard not to not to injure to kill civilians but they made it clear that they will they will attack security forces and they will attack this electoral machinery or they say this is very much and uh of intellectual exercise carried out for the west\nThey will attack security forces and they will attack this electoral machinery or they say this is very much and uh of intellectual exercise carried out for the west and they want to Afghanistan to have no part of it so security forces across Afghanistan or on high alert\nUm it's hard to know when and how they will attack I remember I was here for the last to the elections in Afghanistan which for presidential elections\nAnd the Taliban had been convinced by by Pakistan\nOr by other forces not to attack the polls but they carried out and devastating attack\nAfter the polls close we can't say for certain what will happen this time\nAh I Know the efforts have been made to try to convince the Taliban not to not to damage at this crucial protests but of course no matter what the what the Taliban do or don't do there's still the forces of Islamic state and they will listen to no one and they have carried out some of the most brutal attacks including here in the heart of causal\nOr American troops going to be involved in election related security this weekend\nThis is very much an Afghan led protests and the Afghans are very proud of that the ring of steel as they call it\nAround Kabul is very much a matter for Afghan police Afghan military Afghan intelligence we're visiting\nThe control room of the Afghan police this week they showed us all their security cameras right across the city keeping an eye on all the major streets and the thoroughfares of course the NATO forces including the Americans are in the background\nAdvising providing intelligence they of course have their aircraft but when it comes to securing the vote and they are said to be more than fifty thousand forces involved that is very much Afghans who will be a right to the front for protecting up Afghan people\nIt's been Seventeen years now since the U.S led war in Afghanistan the toppled the Taliban it doesn't sound like they are are giving up anytime soon that they still would like to retake control of the country\nWell that's the big question I think there have been studies which show that the Taliban\nOur eyes are controlling or have an influence in a very large number of Afghan districts the estimates go anywhere from fifty to Seventy percent of of the districts\nBut it has always been said that they cannot take the capital Kabul which would be the most heavily secured a part of of Afghanistan and of course would involve a loss of bloodshed\nWhich is why there is great hope being invested now in the new signs that possibly peace talks could begin there's the new\nLoss of bloodshed which is why there is great hope being invested now in the new signs that possibly peace talks could begin there's the new\nAmerican envoy may highly decide who has was born in Afghanistan is now leading a American official he's former\nUn American ambassador to Afghanistan he's been visiting the Taliban talking to pockets on talking to the Afghans and hoping very much to start a protest which gets the Taliban and the Afghan government around the table to negotiate an end to this war and of course that would involve discussion\nOf the Taliban's main demand that ... that American and other western security forces leave Afghanistan\n[noise] at least you said after all of your trips to Afghanistan over the years what strikes you about the country right now in twenty eight team\nWhat really strikes me about Afghanistan now is that there are the the new war is very much between\nThe dark forces of the past including the Taliban including the powerful warlords including the drugs drug lords and the criminal networks and against a new educated generation of Afghans who are truly inspiring often the reports we hear our young Afghans leaving for Europe\nIt was saying they have no future here turning their back on their country but when you come to Afghanistan what you see is highly educated young Afghans determined to stay here knowing the risks and they are running in record numbers in this these parliamentary elections trying to take on\nThe old forces including the warlords and their sons and mostly sons who are running in these elections so it is very much an election pose between hope and fear\nAnd the greatest hope is that political space safe political face will be open to not\nTo let this new generation have a greater say in forging a new future for this a long embattled\nCountry that the b._b._c. chief international correspondent leads to set in Kabul, Afghanistan as Afghans prepare to vote in parliamentary

talking about thousands of people who are forced to move on to relocate oftentimes abandoning whole cities of civilization some of those places that we now see a tourist attractions in the southwest of these\nAnd empty villages in the hillside some of those are a product of these large massive migrations I'm as a ... another side point of this of course when the Europeans arrived many of them are migrants a very related sword I mean they're fleeing certain kinds of hardship in Europe and many of them are talking about\nFor instance the abundant timber in places like North American trying to find ways in which they can get a slightly more regular livelihood given the deforestation that happened\nIn Europe and the Eighteenth uh nineteenth century and so there's going to be a constant relationship between mass migrations and concerns about the climate and sustainability and then once\nThose Europeans got here and started establishing their own communities here oh what happened to me do we see similar things moving forward\nWhat would need to think about the relationship between climate change is an issue about people as well you could argue that the to the worst things have happened in American history are directly related to that process which is the forced migration of a million people a across the American south\nOr because the climate there enabled this new crop of cotton that are tied back to Europe the way that Nathan was talk before these new industries that are driving\nAnd you found that when you were to slavery I mean I'm Sorry I just uh just to be specific to your odds of slavery and talking about and he was seen that in many ways the worst slavery or in southern Louisiana and the sugar cane fields which go up to the very boundary where the climate will allow them to go and and the rice\nFields on on the planet coast so you see very finely attuned to just a few degrees temperatures you were talking about before about how you can have this forced migration of millions of people in slavery so I'm hearing a theme here that\nPeople tend to follow where the plants and the crops will go because of course that's how we sustain ourselves but also our economy is um what about other reasons that people moved historically related to the climate [noise] well if you think about the ...\nLarge concern now around Atlantic storms there again there's a history of the ways in which hurricanes have forced all kinds of people to basically pull up stakes and relocate I mean this again has a kind of hemispheric\nImpact if you think for instance about some of the Atlantic storms that came through the Caribbean or even hit the southeast in the early part of the twentieth century many of these were quite cataclysmic with really substantial effects I mean you think about a storm in Nineteen Seventeen that really is racking the Caribbean and forcing people in the U.S descend remittances back in Nineteen fifties\nYou have a massive storm hit Jamaica that helps us bonds\nThe storm in Nineteen Seventeen that really is racking the Caribbean forcing people in the U.S descend remittances back in the Nineteen fifties you have a massive storm hit Jamaica that helps to spawn migration to England in that decade and even in the United states is a huge hurricane\nIn Nineteen forty seven late September\nThat creates a huge problem of displacement in the south east of the United states because largely the infrastructure isn't there and this is a reminder to listeners to think about a natural disasters right to Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans was about levees breaking for instance and in the south in the Nineteen forties\nYou at farmers who are being displaced folks were relocated because of racial segregation statues in the south had their whole homes relocated and then subsequently ripped up by massive hurricanes you're talking about hundreds in some cases thousands of migrants of Atlantic storms because of discrimination and a lack of infrastructure even within the United states in the Nineteen forties\nYou know we're talking about that even still today especially as these hurricanes come up the coast a lot of the conversation after those storms rip through and destroy communities is should we rebuild right here on this coastline right yeah absolutely and that's\nThe absolutely what's interesting is how much of that building is a recent from Virginia to Florida from Nineteen eighty to the early ... century a quarter of all American population growth was alone that Atlantic Coast and another large parts courses in\nIn Texas where you have everything's enabled by air conditioning which is a post World war two innovation so the migration voluntary involuntary is sort of creating so to speak a perfect storm where people are moving to where the greatest vulnerability\nIs alive [laughter] we've got to talk about the dust bowl the Nineteen thirties hundreds of thousands of Americans displaced\nAt a very difficult time for the country during the depression and this was not just weather related it also has to do a lot with how Americans were interacting with the land\nSo there were severe drought during the Nineteen thirties and and window erosion that was accompanied hum are really came on the heels of really inefficient irrigation techniques and so angered soil you know basically came up and was turned to to dust and you had over a hundred million acres in Texas Oklahoma New Mexico Kansas and so forth basically ruined as a result of\nAgain decades long degradation the crop losses alone or twenty five million dollars per day that's a Nineteen thirty six dollars the talking almost four hundred and fifty million dollars of losses every single day during the ... in the thirties you have nearly three million people\nWho leave the plain states most of whom go to\nAlmost four hundred and fifty million dollars of losses every single day during the dust bowl in the thirties you're nearly three million people who leave the plain states most of whom go to California and California itself\nBegins with an an act the series of laws to basically restrict some of these migrants in Nineteen thirty three like indigent act in California actually made it a crime\nTo bring indigent person into the state you have local attorneys trying to enforce it with verve and it's not until the ACLU really fight back against us that you get a Supreme Court case in Nineteen forty one that actually makes it okay makes it a law and America\nTo not restrict interstate migration for poor people\nYou write I'm thinking back to the grapes of wrath and the images of the family moving from their homes to the west coast or they were\nDefinitely vilified people were vilified these migrants were not treated well and that's a hint at what might happen in the future doesn't it uh when this happens if it happens again\nWell we need to remember too that one reason we have the grapes of wrath is that it was about white people moving right than about port indigent why people we don't really have representations of\nPeople other ethnic backgrounds who have been displaced and move so I think that it's interesting that we thank gives us something to think with but it doesn't really reflect the big picture\n[laughter] well I'm from the southwest of my family first moved there in the Nineteen fifties because at that time the weather was good the air was clean\nAnd now as I think about how the climate is changing in places like Arizona Southern California New Mexico Colorado there are wildfires there are droughts that have literally lasted more than a decade and I've I've been wondering you know when will people start to leave\nBut also when will people start staying put and other parts of the country and not coming to places in the sun belt I that that's got a really ... the the economy's up a place and the identity of a lot of places

Eighteen into combat\nAnd she's really seen as a Democrats hope to kind of flip one Republican control district in the country in their favor\nYou know she prided herself on really tried to get out into rural parts of the district kind of the assumption is that a Democrat is going to do well in Lexington the urban center of this district um but you know historically has not done so well out in rural areas and so she's really been trying to push her campaign out into the rural parts\nThat it's most evident last week she brought for vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in owing ville it's a town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came to see the vice president\nNow the thing about any McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars at about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and it's a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere's certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know it may nationwide interest in this race I mean it's at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand\nThey're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more TV ads and it's really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November six\nAnd what do the poll say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day [laughter]\nThere seems to be a new poll every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit there there is no way to really say that the one person has an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge a and and really if it's something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election day\nHas uh an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge a and and really if it's something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election\nDay so Kentucky ... six congressional district will be one of those key places people are watching to see if Democrats can take a seat from Republicans and flip the house in the Democrats' favor that's riling Barton statehouse reporter for Kentucky public radio thank you thanks Peter\nThat TV show the counters premiered this Tuesday on ABC it's a new version of the famous sitcom Roseanne but without Roseanne Barr\nABC revived Roseanne last spring the show was a hit it was cancelled though after it's dark tweeted racist remarks now the rest of the cast is back together for a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it higher Eric\nHi so the first episode is a send off to the character rows and counter we learned that she her character died of a an opioid overdose or here's a clip of her sister on the show Jackie who's played by Laurie Metcalf talking to John Goodman character Dan which is Roseanne husband I just\nFrom a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nSo Roseanne Barr are released a statement after that episode aired calling the decision to kill off her character this way grin and morbid what do you think\n[noise] I think she's right but I also think the storytelling worked [laughter]\nUm they had for shadow that I'm Roseanne Connor the character would be struggling with a an addiction and pain pills and so if they're going to kill off the character to do it in this way makes a lot of sense for the character and it also hooked into all of these issues\nAbout people being under insured and the working class folk struggling to deal with medication all of this stuff that the show wants to talk about I can now talking about because of the way that there was any kind of character passed all important\nIssues the question is who saw the show are and we're seeing that the ratings for the premier of the Connors we're down to just ten point five million compared with Eighteen million people on average you tuned into Roseanne when they returned last march\nRight but um there's a few things going on there and I mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne the revival was debuting and then you also had news\nA few things going on there and I mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne the revival was debuting\nAnd then you also had news that there was an encounter character was going to be a Trump supporter\nAnd I think that fueled a lot of talk about the show so I think it kind of made sense that it would do this huge number now over the course of his run it did an average of about Eighteen million viewers so I don't think the Connors is going to get to that level\nBut it's drawing about the same audience that Roseanne revival was doing when it ended his run in may and then it's going to be their challenge the kind of building the audience and retain people who may have just watched the Connors out of curiosity to see what happened to ... character\nBut they're avoiding more partisan politics and the counters than they did in Roseanne\nI seen two episodes of the show and for those two episodes it certainly seems that way you know originally if you remember the original version of Roseanne that was a show that tried to talk about all of the different issues that face to working class family and it wasn't quite as part is and I mean\n\nNow is the perfect time to clean out the garage and get rid of that car you no longer need\nThey'll face the coming months with a fresh start and by donating your used

rough couple of weeks or three percent drop last Wednesday one per ... per cent decline yesterday\nOf course that's nothing compared to what happened thirty one years ago today when the u._s. stock market dropped twenty two point six percent the largest single day loss in us history [noise]\nNew York times financial reporter Diana Henry case wrote about what led up to that day and what can be learned from it in her book a first class catastrophe the road to black Monday the worst day in Wall Street history I spoke with her last September and began by asking her what made her want to dive into this crisis\nWe're talking with younger people in my circle even younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew about the Nineteen eighty seven crash\nI Lived through it myself as a reporter but the mythology that has grown up around black Monday Israeli an amazing monument to Wall Street ... let me tell you\nPeople will tell you oh it was no big deal was over in a day it was one and done and nothing could be further from the truth so it was so\nI kind of wanted to solve a mystery here why has black Monday been so forgotten why have we not recognized what it was showing us and taken that to heart\nWell why did you start your book where you did in the seventies because he has to indicate that that was the beginning of what led to a\nGreat question and I ... my ... book opens on the silver crisis uh which was a bubble and the silver market but what was significant about that crisis which was in the commodity market far from Wall street was the way it quits\nThe market but what was significant about that crisis which within the commodity market far from Wall street was the way it quickly led to the traditional fire breaks\nThe panic spread from market to market from the commodity market to the brokerage industry to banks and the various regulators of all those marketplaces barely knew each other's names\nSo we open on a world where official Washington is still kind of trapped in this delusion that they are all these isolated markets that can be regulated separately\nAnd the silver crisis in Nineteen eighty blew that delusion apart for those who were paying attention and then along the way I illustrate the heated occasions when\nA panic refused to stay where it was supposed to so that by the time you arrive at black Monday you understand that this didn't just pop out of the clear blue sky this was the culmination of a series of misjudgments missteps fundamental changes in how Wall Street worked\nWhen one of the fundamental changes was the rise of electronic trading how big a role to play\nIt was an enormous role and it was very unfamiliar to most investors at the time particularly the main street investors the extent to which computers were speeding the flow of orders into the marketplace at the speed of light\nAnd many of those markets were still operating at what I call the speed of life not the speed of light they were human markets they were trying to operate\nAs they had operated for a hundred years\nAnd they were overwhelmed by the pace of automated order delivery\nIn addition if further in the background in the shadows beyond even the vision of alert regulators more the use of computers to devise new and destabilizing trading strategies to create new\nFinancial derivatives that were used in imaginative and unusual ways so the computer was a tool of the financial engineers who were creating the new products that would so ah affect trading on black Monday\nMust say as you're talking about this it sounds kind of familiar after having just lived through the crash of two thousand a year\nAffect trading on black Monday\nI must say as you're talking about this it sounds kind of familiar after having just lived through the crash of two thousand eight you know people talking about a lot of a fast trading and new products that nobody understands\nYou're exactly right I mean in in Nineteen eighty seven there were these tighten investors who use these untested derivatives\nIn computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system\nExactly the same thing happened in two thousand eight too big to fail investors using untested derivatives and high speed heard investing strategies with fragmented oversight so we're right back where we started only with exponentially larger scale and risks\nThat you brought up the issue of regulators you talk in this book about Ronald Reagan who took office uh in Nineteen eighty one and was pushing for smaller government was appointing people who wanted to cut back\nOn regulations how much responsibility did Reagan and his administration have in the crash in Nineteen eighty seven well\nIt's sort of a mixed bag Jeremy yes um there was a new deregulatory fever in Washington the lady that played out however was in skimpy rations for the regulators to the to the extent that the regulatory machinery was\nUnder staffed and under financed that was a result of this determination to cut back\nOn big government but I should point out that after the crash it was a blue ribbon commission appointed by President Reagan led by a staunch Republican Brady\nWho recommended that we scrap our current regulatory system and put a unit a five regulator in charge in Washington\nSo both the prescription for what we should do and some of the problems that gave rise to black Monday can be traced back to these political divisions but I should also say that\nThe Democrats in Congress on the left in the Nineteen eighties we're not really part of the solution either a day one and more funding for regulatory agencies true but they failed to undertake the serious oversight of these profound changes in the marketplace\nOne I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators of the financial industry because it is\nAngels in the marketplace one I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators of the financial industry because it is so complicated how can we expect them to understand all these new products enough to oversee\nWell that's why we need to look at the regulatory structure we have\nWe don't expect our politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately fund the department of energy and make sure that the risks that that agency overseas are adequately taken care of I think the same thing is true of our financial markets yes they are\nExtremely complex and yes they are algorithm driven and there's lots of rocket scientist from academia who were making fortunes on Wall street and that is arcane and bizarre for a lot of people in the political realm\nBut they still have the responsibility of making sure that the regulatory agency is appropriately structured appropriately funded and appropriately staffed so that you can understand what's happening on Wall street even if they can't\nDo do you get a better understanding in writing this book of why crashes happen how something that seems small can get out of control very quickly and spread and cause a market crash\nYes although it wasn't a big surprise you know we've been laboring for decades out into the um\nThe notion of unofficial market a rational market where investors make rational decisions and and those decisions are incorporated into the prices of securities automatically I never found that particularly persuasive I've got to be a good appreciation for how people panic in a crisis [noise]", "show_name": "Here and
