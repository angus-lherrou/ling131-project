the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing\nCandidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star as of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump's favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single payer health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here and at the very least we would need\nA con sorts of states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now are the Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other states while we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissent has said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to healthcare is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem\nAnd his Tallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime much that is experienced\nSaid to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's\nTallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate the missile defenses described how community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's eight clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if communities do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we'd Institute or restore to justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community\nGet the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high law this uh you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality\nI Wanna see that President Trump down in your debate with Ron dissent is you said he was just too much for the president he made no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is with habitats of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nIn terms polling numbers they bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do it\nI'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe it's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr to saint as\nHe is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself in a print is to Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency\nAnd common sense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nHundred ... says if you this\nBut trying to create a kind of society and a kind of get a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nTerms of ... says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ministry and Alison money on many for the environmental plans that you have for the state\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia or we don't bow down to the president we work with a take for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Florida two point eight billion dollars I'm going to take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to\nHelp him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott now who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent to Santa's is now positioning himself has said Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to fail reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting governors Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of photos capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acres solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new car she every level almost portable level to reduce the number of nitrate going into our groundwater\nWhen we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say\nWhere we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor of Tallahassee democratic a gubernatorial candidate here in Florida maybe kill and thanks so much for speaking to us\nOf course ... part of our\nTalk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Guillaume his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer had Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum brother now the text for Cory reads Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight\n\n... here and if you're in

Republican some of the road\nThat Wendy Alaska is in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel a Jake Bernstein an Alexander to heal healthcare President Trump\nCan the sitting governor of the Republican Rick Scott unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson has a lot going on to let's convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and began surveyed oh an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami Jaime gay Hi Robyn I'm getting closer to you I'm In your state I'm Glad [laughter]\nAnd we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin ... well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean handled it makes it after this race and his share\nAnd Andrew Gillum as we said has been sending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean handled and makes it after this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story the text\nIn which a gala his friend a lobbyist told them about this health in ticket or that the developer had for them Gillum responds awesome but he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIs is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent isn't some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers questions\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third\nUm ... democratic I'm a I'm an African American candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissent is on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president say people in the administration Florida has a lot of names from our military footprint our transportation or water resources what's been a big problem here and we need to work constructively what the federal government\nAndrew Gillum is running on pinching Donald Trump I don't know what for but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWell I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get us\nPresident Trump playing out in this race well I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's saying uh\nNo I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being Sanders was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided well before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for Kennedy will\nEnrique as if they don't let me bring you in here because the president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this as he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way to Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are going something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack on the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the care of and then saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those uh ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nBush said the the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm um I Do think it could be one of those X factor is coming to the election Robin and I'm really see the impact all the coverage and all the attention describe and has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nUh we'll see that on a ... depending on the turnout both parties I think it really is a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cat and that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last thing that made got so much attention that CNN is reporting that just three people uh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this every day we we\nIn that CNN is reporting that just three people uh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this every day we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block um you will have people who will be a of\nYou know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr from one state in two thousand the sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans to many of them who are already in Florida before money about all the security Maria over ... have seems a coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor race and and and the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not among holistic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling uh shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nWalker Nelson\nThey like high taxes um\nAndrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise]\nAnd also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out were

felons have to wait at least five years and petition the state board to win back their rights\nBut on November sex voters will decide whether to amend their state constitution and automatically grant the right to vote to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nThe voters will decide whether to amend their state constitution and automatically grant the right to vote to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nIf it passes amendment for would restore voting rights to former felons upon completion of their sentence unless they were convicted of murder or a sex crime here now is Chris Stanley took a closer look\n[noise] it's opening day after living harvest a thrift shop and south Tallahassee the stores managed and staffed by former felons making the transition back into society [noise]\nStay away the nonprofit found [noise] he was sentenced to fix and a half years in prison for felony DUI and it was released in the year two thousand since then he's gotten sober and started this nonprofit to help others turn their lives around but finding housing unemployment\nI'm a big big person about second chances because I Know people change and I know the way I was if those people have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would be better for the\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a former felon himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally returned home and try to rebuild my life partner that wanting to be a part of the community couldn't happening no so I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for non violent felons to gain their rights back\nHis administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott as approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand other crest\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past felony conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three Canaan remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nA set at a car that he hadn't even going to be able to feel deprived I felt ashamed of failed ignorant [noise] those are real bad feelings that thing that I I haven't even forgive him suffer feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process as intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we could live alone so other people [laughter] so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nWell [laughter] so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against amendment for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but getting what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong and potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be\nDecided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for the seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making Porter less safe Leon county sheriff wall to make Neal agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like a you know the sexual batters who uh as keeping them away from kids in the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to take\nBut just the fundamental right to vote there is no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nWith tourists them from any other crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole condition that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under governor crashed were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic fundamental rights it was a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to uh give up and turned to a life of crime or 'cause there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I Want it in an office to her next certain things but I never got involved because I say what I Can't make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen\nThat kind of made me feel like well\nGo to Bob cause us or what I can make a difference so really it made me feel lifted a citizen discount made me feel like we're not sure what we're\nSort of recently got his rights restored him while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me to go like or a book of this part of a book lists I'm not a political either and I'm not sure we'll Evelyn do a drug test me for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in the case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip the Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices\nTo replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats governor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland nice even person I'm explain this decision will you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get to hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is an office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into that\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nIt's very different but I can hear president or former president broke Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course London do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices\nDifferent but I can hear president or former president Barack Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you here of course wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis\nPicky acquaintances I'm all part of a ... a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for three decisions is the fourth record how important is this\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders\n\nI'm Gail Rogers director of the Georgia and Alabama officers of the southern environmental law center the southern environmental law center is an advocacy organization that uses the power of the law to protect the air we breathe the water we drink and the natural special places here in Georgia\nWhere you see it as a natural synergy being an underwriter of Georgia Public broadcasting\nWe've see public radio as an important audience\nTo find out more about becoming a corporate sponsor emails sponsorship at ... dot org [noise]\nStacey Abrams and Brian camp now met face to face in their first debate\nWho's arguments for bail this is a debate change the dynamics of the final weeks of the race find bill now you were gathering some of our top political insiders to look at how the debate went down joined the agency's ...

I mean there's a new housing new has just struggling with balancing act balancing that how do you possibly take not enough workers and take on more\nSo in order to bring you into the conversation what are you hearing from people who have been hurt by Michael\nThe lack of finding anyone to help them the lack of um equipment a lack of roofers and a lot of unlicensed activity\nElse do workers that there are I'm sure you have to really compete to keep them maybe raise salaries mark maybe they increased benefits\nIf there's not enough ... town or not enough electricians in town to do the amount of work than when they did the jobs they raise their prices because they know there's no one else to come in to take the work or if mark\nHas his paint are coming and I know he's coming to Mars job and I look at him and I said listen here you know how about a few extra hundred bucks to come by assuming\nYou Patti mark in the back as you're saying that\nTell us your small community there is some of that trading that does go around\nWell that's neat and training for one thing but you're talking about the link you convening we ought to be\nThe talked about what happened because of the recession a huge blow but then you have this you know slow steady blow that has to do with immigration I mean we're reading that some of the cuts in both legal and illegal immigration are you're nodding markers are impacting the building industry\nThey are if you look at a lot of the trades they are immigrants I Believe the hurricane Michael the damage done over there if we did not have workers from other countries that worked just would not get done what do you do what\nDoing through education and bringing our younger kids and introducing them in the construction for decades we've taught them it's gotta be college just got to because you got to be college and you know there's a vast majority of aid don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them\nAnd we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract isn't the way over here\nAnd and these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and climbing\nSo at some point there's going to be higher demand\nAnd then these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and asked climbing so at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right I mean we push college and for many people the college just the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through a future bills America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school\nAnd they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field and making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but but not to lead immigration just yet\nIf you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and it's you're telling me it's necessary for your industry so what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard workers often times the immigrants are on the job before anybody else they're working hard to stay until sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nAnd so I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that far industry and other industries need [noise] mark\nAre you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah\nAs I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had a lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and one thing I notice in common of all of his it's primarily a Hispanic workers in this area\nNeeds to be rebuilt absolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because their homes are gone their place of business might be gone to shop that he had just gone it's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country and that's just the way it is\nElse would change this place and we see\nIt's gone it's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country and that's just the way it is\nElse would change this equation we see a move recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools we spent many years not exposing young people to that type work and telling him what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college [noise]\nThe guys right here standing there doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nDoes she think there'd be some sort of government involvement of kind of making it more enticing what how else to get their\nRevert back to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisor heroes and you're\nYou know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies in double triple that\nOne more thing I think the stigma that's what the big talk was the last Thirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big hurdle you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming the and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will not have a building well\nNo I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe\nOther states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City in Mexico beach the structures that survived for not that much different than what we're building right
