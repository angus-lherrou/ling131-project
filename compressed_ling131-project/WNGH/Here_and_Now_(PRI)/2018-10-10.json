been following her recovery ever since ... recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over Julie pie as joins us to talk about it ... it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed\nA fresh fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my uh medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and I'm just a quieter call my life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical [noise]\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am I'm responsible for all my medical care from here on ... and ... how is that working out financially [noise]\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay for some of my co workers who have had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind\nAnd seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have for every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct with our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were staying on the county um even for that second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing\n[noise] but now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy\nSo we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I mentioned it might\nJust enjoy this retirement and uh spending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area are you doing physically after all those surgeries [noise]\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police and he got a hold of me\nAnd we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout United ... so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from that\nBarry healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from that\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned\nEach of us had such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he\nGives his perspective from a supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nOf what they experienced and what was running through their mind and how law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side [laughter] I Know quite a few of my co workers all they saw was law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\n[noise] uh I recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during the shooting\nAnd after I found that out about him I didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Detroit thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nWater those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice I think they expect to see\nThey can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story to become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\n[noise] there have been so many

Scott hey Jeremy\nAnd with me in the studio Cape BCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent for Cape PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom a Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox\nScott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate\nThis week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin\nNewsom said first the California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people uh Scott knew some has a big one\nCan't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be on affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls just Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him or the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent and the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when he has to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will it be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies\nAnd new indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues a nuisance support sanctuary cities for example he backs California becoming a zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas is early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like insane toddler care and pre school was severely cut\nAnd those have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nAs you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nOr the governor's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property\nTaxes are way way out of whack\nSuck to move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall drugs are boring through in California can do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how was\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater or last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem and these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and he's congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nI forwarded ... homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless ... says that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races\nAnd you know they're just issues of affordability that I think a lot of these are new party preference voters at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nLet's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some have said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ... ah\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead in every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think\nKevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate\nSalinger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know it's I haven't seen\nBroadway but one thing one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old\nHe's fifty one he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nYou know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California and\nDaily and arguments are certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we find a rewind back to twenty sixteen\nBernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California and many of them are young people get engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more out and looking for a change in the Senate race\nUrban

C. A. actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population\nBut there and again we were seeing providers drop out of the market so there's a lot of things to be worked on health

was simple it was never a criminal\nLitigation that civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make it and it went to a jury trial\nSo I really do believe that it's been misrepresented than politicians when they have no record to run on frequently like to dig up old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two thousand Thirteen lived you think that that is hurting you know in this race oh well if you can't defend yourself it\nDoes but I got the ... actually you know are are asking about it now\nAnd I'm explaining it it's on my website I

fastest growing ethnic group in this state they now make up more than fourteen percent of the population a slice of the pie that has tripled in size since Nineteen eighty and in orange county where there are four congressional races that the cook Political Report labels competitive\nIt's about eight hundred thousand of right now we are over twenty percent of the county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nFood executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI say it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community is foreign born escorting to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rise of second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim his principal and CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James ... the former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nPerson ration tends to vote Republican\nAnd my ... your friends\nAre more in the Democratic side why is that\nA bit of rebellion\nBy second generation of friends\nAre more on the Democratic side why is that\nA little bit of rebellion\nA butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans of Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma more types of financial distress\nThe first generation tend to say why the Republicans because they see the\nThe corruption the government the distrust in government and why the second generation\nGoing more democratic I think because of the American values the\nA lot of these Korean Americans that grew up in second generation uh tend to grow up in urban areas\nAnd I think that's part of the process or in urban areas tend to\nFocus more progressive thinking\nThen more of the conservative the suburban ideal\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nThe thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here through chain migration so the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration\nSo it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally\nA of a majority of them\nAnd they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country will definitely be the my\nFriends I lean more democratic or\nLiberal Republicans are progressive Republicans I myself\nHave definitely some qualms about that ...\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like tan and sunny new when we met them at a cafe sending owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon\nSunny told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I I think you know you look at generation one which is our parents and and I we we're one point fight and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nWe were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from\nWe were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it starts\nNot just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a a country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from us so we came over here you see a lot of all visit family cash only\nPay you know what you you don't want to say what\nWe have our own strategy that we don't want to share a best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why for generations they're known\nTo be very fragmented right and and you don't want to collaborate we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew in\nAnd being an American or you know and having inclusive of the I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown it because we do collaborate and we're showing\n'em or Christian parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing best practices we're actually sharing our best practice entrepreneur and they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big difference and from generation one\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county it's fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nMy family came to this country we came leaving\nWe wanted the outage Kenny America provided to see it on our own\nYoung two of them raised by the sea register for her consistent record opposing tax increases\nWaiting for fiscal responsibility\nYoung Kim for Congress\nThere hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November says political consultant Alex Kim\nYong Kim of course locally here with Kevin and also I'm Andy Kim and may not related\nNot related at all you still cameras are very popular name a Korean American Muslim\nBigger quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like that\nA quarter of your current Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican them helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about all soldiers connection is this a definite connection than having not a single Korean American in Congress right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat Republican I Would like to see a Korean American on there to reverse of\nWe heard something similar from Vietnamese American Pam knew it\nYou know I see myself especially as a business owner the community as a Vietnamese American first before being part of the party of those Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment Marion food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education\nThat housing Asian American no matter how long they've been here they get the question of you know where you really from or where are you from I'm fourth generation my family's been here since Nineteen sixty one and I still get it or things like your English is so good and\nAnd you know where you really really from what languages did speak and I have to really explain only speak English or Spanish I'm and I'm you know my family's been here for so long that it it's those types of questions we always get it and so it makes people feel that\nThey're not really accepted or they're not really American [noise]\nSo what do you think that means for the upcoming election [noise] I think it's really important to show as Asian Americans how crucial we are to civic engagement and how important it is for us to vote and have a voice but also how important it is to educate a the general public about the issues that we find are", "year": "2018",
