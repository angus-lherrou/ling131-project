gives us a look at at Nineteen fifties Australia you know we've in the United states we're coming up this a frenzy about Downton Abbey which takes us intimately into this fascinating world of English aristocracy a century ago\nYou're a series takes us to Australia and the and the age we think of as Eisenhower and leave it to beaver and sort of a we have enough to object simplistic looked at the Nineteen fifties but sort of peeling back the layers to tell us about Australia in the Nineteen fifties\nWhether it was posed tools for us that's how we define it so there was a depression um people who are returning or not so there was a lot of loss a lot of shrapnel emotional shrapnel in people's psyche is\nA lot of them in a disappeared and said that women had sort of taken a found a better

didn't between this family and this woman it's really a look at where we've Bain and how far we've come about what I Love about this show and back in late to create what he's done he's set it as a melodrama and he talks about um\nThe ... films so he's referencing a particular genre and so it's quite heightened but it's it's about a deep underlying um prejudice\nAnd racism and the phobia and um the such as to the subjects that we haven't really explored on a straight in television necessarily before\nIt is interesting that we can look at these hard issues and we've got the same challenges in the United states and\nIt's sort of disarmed us to go back to the fifties and and look at it how how was dumped with in that time and then to sort of be haunted by the fact that we're still struggling with it today talk for a minute or two about the whole idea of the adjustment for a society where women all of a sudden are going to be more respected in and at the same time expect more\nIndependent that I had that sense when I saw you even when you were stealing from a Britain back to Australia after the war in in a place to go home the sense was you were going to march right in there and this is a new age and women are going to be respected\nWell Australia had always been very family based women in the kitchen men out to work it really had pain that way for a very very long time and as I say much demand left so that women have to fill those roles they were pushed out of the kitchen and into the workforce\nThe thing about Sarah she comes with also Europe and surviving a robin's broke

because it is it's a full absorption in another place and it's like a different world um it's like traveling when I traveled to Japan and I go this is like being on another planet I Love it so much\nBecause it's so different and so completely ... and that's what they show really is\nAnd it's just beautifully written and delicious lethal domed and wonderful acting I Do think that a lot of us it's a hit in Australia in part because Australians are just ... about the fifties or does it a challenge them to see where they are today and and and where they need to go\nI think by those things and I think actually what so unique about this show is that three generations sit down to watch it together\nAnd that old fashioned thing of sitting around the fire then sitting around the radio than sitting around the television has been returned to families a lot of people talk about that how they all sit down together because everyone can watch it and everyone can relate to it there's\nThere's three generations of women and men playing out their lives that there's something to recognize for everyone\nWhat a delight for the older generation to sit down with their grandchildren and because

strenuous can I lurched fearing it takes rarely three and a half hours from start to finish extremely well organized\nOn how the group has no more than fourteen and um they pick you up I think it's every half hour or hour you go along with a certain way here to our guys will stop you explain what you're looking at from your vantage point give you some history of the city and the bridge\nHe gone

can't get hurt because you're harnessed and your your hitched to that cable right right so you're just like a second potatoes dangling from the cable and your guide them slide you to the end but\nI

what's your favorite place to travel and Australia and why\nMy favorite place is Tasmania um it's a tiny little island on the bottom of a straight\nDown the bottom of the right hand side and my husband's from this so I'm I've been going now with the ... saying is\nIt's still going to all the old sandstone building from the convict days it's I'm not very far you can drive forty minutes at the most and you're in the most incredible\nSeaside towns of seeking it and Franklin historically they're incredibly rich they've got a pools that will explode in your mouth they uh they have ... different types of Apple's it's sort of cold the apple ... for that reason the\nFood the the people that calmness um if you can imagine it calmer than astray there already is it has its own special piece and it's much cold down there so it's very ... very alive it has some of the most beautiful national pox I think in the world\nAnd you can walk them a great amount and walk and be able to has been walk along the coast you can do them via companies say stay in hot and the whole way which is pretty nice or you can free will get yourself um but they really a world\nHeritage walks and um it's just it's one of the most beautiful places I think I guess the thing\n... it sounds just and chanting\nNow if I'm if I'm a big fan of uh an stole Jake old fashioned liquid Australia from the Nineteen fifties because I started getting into a place to go home and it inspires me to go to Australia and try to find a quiet Eddie from the past are there any places in Australia where you might feel like you're back in the Nineteen fifties\nIn small towns along the way [laughter] um but not really in the major cities on the rocks obviously in Sydney which is with the help of bridges\nIs maintained and has historical walks we can hear the history of each building and how it was built and against the sandstone and the ... but for me what a straight he really has to offer as sin nights\nThe history of each building and how it was built and against the ... and the convicts but for me what a stray really has to offer is the nature\nAnd often these communities that we've been talking about like for example there's a place called ... which is at Cape ... on the west coast of Australia right up the top it's a\nAn indigenous run place that you can go and it has five star tents and then to stop hot so it fits everyone's brave\nAnd it takes a day to drive there or you can side there in a small airplane and that really gives you an idea of the remoteness of Australia and how isolated in left alone it really is to the rest of the world and to me that the Eddie looking for when you come to this place the activity\nIt can be a place of complete solitude which when I go to America I Know and I also have places like that but I'm In Australia that they seem almost like you're the only person there seemingly laying Tasmania this place called wine glass by that you can do any walking to\nAnd are meant that the time me and my husband went in there was absolutely nobody that so we went skinny dipping\nWater and I don't I don't really they just extraordinary and\nUm and not far from a major hub where you can have a beautiful meal in some delicious wine so um I think you're less searching for the Nineteen fifties and more things with that timeless place but I feel like if you try to office
