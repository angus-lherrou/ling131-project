University in and then teach it at Cambridge but it wasn't until I happened upon this project that I managed to connect these two very disparate parts of my life\nNo the subtitle of your book a Shakespeare in Swahili land is in search of a global poet it's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a hero of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nYeah well I think a part of the story is a new about cultural imperialism um it's about a British rate is taking a Shakespeare to East Africa as a kind of ... to protect them against the dock confident\nButs what few people realize is that very early on in his history Shakespeare became detached from Britain from being simply a British possession on and was translated into a wide number of uh of languages\nSo for instance one of the great discoveries in this book was to find that Indians who had\nTaken Shakespeare from British culture back in India but had been proved type to build the railways in East Africa in the early twentieth century had is extraordinary culture all performance of Shakespeare in Mumbai in nearly twenty century I at one point\nShakespeare was being performed a more in Mumbai southern in London's West End\nAnd these were you know glorious Lee irreverent productions much like Shakespeare's own day you know Shakespeare was that was released his check for Bayh was a man of the the us to do what's necessary to get bums on seats to entertain the audience and these were very much\nShakespeare plays but taken in re made 'em to speak to the people who are performing them in Mumbai say nearly twenty century so I think you know as long as things don't become\nPetrified as long as we you know we didn't put things on a pedestal and insist that they don't change in order to understand them in New ways then set knees Shakespeare can and has come and live in in very very different places than the way he originally wrote the place you\nThat's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on a real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to it\nThese players when they're used by for instance immigrant laborers from India in East Africa are they adapted to fit the culture or the amped up to be more entertaining or on their level or are they just spray translations of Shakespeare like we would not\nUm no I mean they they are adopted again there's a wonderful twelfth night where instead of being shipwreck off the coast of Kenya as happens in Shakespeare's play the opening scene sees a train wreck which sweeps they are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and obviously that's kind of speak to people\nWho are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know as hamlet settled movie called ... Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation and again spoiler alert here since anyone who's never see for me and Juliet or instead of stabbing herself at the end of the play she uses a poisonous snake\n... which kind of tone or into because that's how again ... sorry\nThat's helped create Patrick dollars at the end of ... so it's this kind of wonderfully fertile reimagining of the ... and one that pack down houses or the U.S.'s\nWith five hundred people every night of the week and these were corrugated ... in a fledgling city a mom pass on you know I think it it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East Africa in cities even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land in search of a global poet\nEdward is it safe to say I mean you're focuses East Africa\nBut would this be East Africa as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and I got to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet\nAnd re Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia and Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he's used as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the explorers he's used by that mission raised to create a written culture of Swahili language\nThat is now a spoken by a hundred million people he's translated into Swahili he's in he's performed by these Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flashpoint for talking about the extent to which these countries in the optimal\nBy these Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flashpoint for talking about the extent to which these countries in the aftermath of colonialism want to be open to the culture of the people who had beaten colonial open ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYes they're Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to and it's one which hopefully captures a set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda\nParts of the Congo allowing him which Swahili is that the main or one of the major languages\nThis also in the region was government as a kind of single entity by the British colonies so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices mission raised landed on the coast which is why I asked why he has spoken Swahili is\nCut very Arabic influenced bend to language and as the colonial governments moved inland and uh they would damned if they were going to speak I learned more than one language so they made everyone else learns what he has they moved in and out of four\nIs just happens to be a convenient language for the Conan overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism twice as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is a legacy of colonialism but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created to shed culture between all of the African culture within one of these countries in East Africa\nWho you talked about uh the missionaries using Shakespeare's what Nineteen century missionaries and checks for having common when it comes to sway left\nThe main character in this story is a chest cold ed wood who was the mission ... Central Africa sent out from Britain\nHe arrives in Zanzibar in Eighteen sixty seven and he isn't machinery and it's his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity but he sees it as central to listen to create electricity so he actually spends a lot of the time trying to understand\nLocal cultures translating Swahili ... into English and trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things Princeton Swahili is a translation of channels and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational taxed schoolchildren in Kenya\nA ... a printed on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational tax to schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania to almost a century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their faith and in order to do that people had to be literate and missionaries had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a ... a you believe that won gold has created to old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can ... an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this this great genius\nDon't tell me this afternoon it for here on GB radio and online that GB\nNews dot org support for G.

P. and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark some times I've been in in traditional music or sessions and Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength ... and I just I Walk out of there\nSparks sometimes I've been in in traditional music or sessions and Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength ... and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really yeah\nTransformational is is such a great word to describe a\nWhen you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and not tell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was\nI wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called secret rose and they uh had an album called\nI'll get to us here in the [noise]\nIt was so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go\nTo the lamb this Mueller that's made from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listen to some music or Greek\nI Want to go to the fjord and look at the view where his cabin was when he was inspired to write that given music is sometimes so unfair and you want to be translated it and\nYou want to go to the to the place from where it blossomed guests music can sometimes it inside travel okay so you're organizing this now in a sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yeah so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back [laughter]\nYou didn't want to go back because you thought you'd be ruining it ruining it\nYeah I you know it's so hard to replicate something of reality about it yeah it was like all back with a TV crew and it's really come out where's the magic amateur last year was incredible do it again\nYeah and sometimes that doesn't that so I did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of ice on my radio show I ended up hooking up with their trade commissioner and general counsel if you're in North America leaner good Johnson\nAnd that to a series of events ended up culminating in a U.S actually going to Iceland and broadcasting live and I had to do a scouting location or your trip before\nAnd I've been fourteen or Fifteen times now and every time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and we would not keep going back and broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year\nThe time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and we would not keep going back in broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year over year which is remarkable for a country of three hundred and twenty five thousand people\nBut it is this music that comes out of Iceland or is this a celebration of many cultures that go to be together and nice like\nWell it's a bit of both now with the music fest we broadcast from its called ice on the airwaves and it's a showcase for Icelandic and Nordic\nBans new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries\nAlong with a beautifully curated selection of international band seven's a gathering of people from all over the world\nBut the focus is Icelandic and I think what's happening now do musically because of the Internet is were all able to hear music from all over the world so musicians and creative people who are curious become naturally ...\nThat's a boon for music culture internationally and it's probably a benefit of the Internet a lot of people don't don't appreciate and don't take advantage of like they might\nThe fire and I punched his way above its weight as the source for innovative contemporary music\nOur guest right now in travel with Rick Steves is Kevin cool\nOf Seattle's noncommercial key XP radio\nOf music post on weekday afternoon\nKevin sharing why he travels to that Iceland Airwaves festival every November in Reykjavik the hair wet it's many bands and musicians are up to each year\nYou'll find links to the festival hand\nTo Kevin radio show\n... dot com slash radio\nKevin when we're talking about this listener's experienced this attendees experience this music appreciation experience [noise]\nI don't think of Iceland is a place with great intimate Venus I mean I've had magic experiences in pubs or in in wonderful beer gardens and so on but what is the venue like does that contribute to it in Iceland or is it just I'm a concert hall\nIceland Airwaves is a a multiple shows and events happening each night over four nights\nIn various different venues and sometimes not even pennies because any space that could be a cool place to host a band becomes one but they got things like uh the harp a concert hall which is an amazing facility that is where\nBecause any space that could be a cool place to host a ban becomes one but they've got things like ah the harp a concert hall which is an amazing facility that is\nWhere are all I've been there that's a matter of pride for Reykjavik really is the concert hall standing right every Scandinavian capitals seems to really prioritize for a suitably creative and rooted in in local values kind of a wonderful concert hall\nYeah I think all the stone is is a volcanic Blackstone definitely rooted in their in their country\nIceland brags it's one of the most illiterate nations are I think they got more books published per capita than anywhere in or if it has a vibrant music scene is as you're tuned into with all sorts of of creative genres\nAnd lots of creative people have you thought about what makes Iceland a punch above its weight or ... that sort of phrase a because it's a tiny island and it's in darkness most of the year [laughter] what what is it about it that has so much creativity\nMan that's that is a great question and music journalists had been trying to break the code on that one right like why does is a small country have such an incredible music scene and why is it so creative and\nAnd I think it's a whole bunch of different factors in fact I had the the president of Iceland on my show a older for grim some and\nWe were talking about Iceland's assets you know you've got geothermal energy and the the knowledge around that you've got the fishing industry you've got data mining but he said that the most valuable asset of Iceland is a creativity of the people",
