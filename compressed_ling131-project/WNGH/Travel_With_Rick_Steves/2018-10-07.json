is the author of the moon guy\nCalled living abroad Japan Ruth he also hosts tours of Hokkaido website is living abroad in Japan dot com you grow up\nPaul living abroad Japan Ruthie also hosts tours of Hokkaido website is living abroad in Japan dot com you grow up as a child of a missionary parents in I don't I was always curious about this it seemed like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace pop religions that come and go do you have any ever think about that while you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted is part of their life\nIt's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she still has to do with\nSacredness and the president life ...\nAnd so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival I might be Buddhist it might be ... though it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just setting up the numbers are you said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought it in or sent plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred but it right away because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I guess you'd say for missionary such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody accept Christianity and then exclude the other religions\nOr so and as a missionary you'd have to do that's from the northern got to be for me or or this sort of a rite exclusive\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kind of like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so they would tax write they would take on Christianity but but it wouldn't be\nThe only religion Ruthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what his Buddhism and what his Hindu as I Am and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she do means the way of the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of nature a beautiful\nLee ... told means the way of the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings too that God that help God of agriculture for example so there are no images inching do like statues are idols or anything and it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God\nHas mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the amber who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state of the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and miss that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals that sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something\nA sheep though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or ... rice planting festivals that are related to ... though so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas one year and and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk\nAnd then on New Year's it like a whole time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging this gong what a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of things that you may have committed to temple down very slowly hundred and eight\nTimes [noise] and then as soon as midnight just\nPassed on New Year's morning people flock to the ... they'll trying to pray for health and success\nAnd happy new year and by ambulance or\nEven something to put in your car for traffic\nAnd success and happy new year and by ... or\nEven something to put in your car for traffic safety and so on at the ... so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she do for the new year [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves for talking with Ruth you can make your book is the moon guidebook cost of living abroad Japan\nAnd really the one we're thinking about living in Japan what's the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on and on the domestic world these days are just in general\nYes well I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment in a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to working long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to\nBut the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career\nThan they are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes then they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true anymore so there isn't any changing yes\nSo the younger generation has has pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to do that on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or right start some kind of new service or go overseas\n[noise] our phone number is eight seven seven three three three seven four to five and Scott is calling us from lake mountain Georgia he's got thanks for your call pirate how
