not all those moving parts of the same right and when you get as we've got some of the heavyweights pushing and shoving the end result is not usually a net positive which gets us\nThe latest global economic growth forecast from the international Monetary Fund in a nutshell still good but not as good as it would have been without the aforementioned pushing and shoving and the trade war\nThe IMF has downgraded its growth forecast this year from three point nine to three point seven percent next year ticked down from two point seven to two and a half percent\nYes not huge but it's ... percent here to ten percent there pretty soon you're talking about real economics marketplaces ... sure gets going with more on what could be dragging down in a year's time\nThe IMF isn't saying the world's economies are all going to contract just that things are going to slow down\nRelative to where we thought we were last year [noise] or even six months ago we are right now in a in my opinion slightly worst place\nJacob Kirkegaard is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute on the one in the U.S is still in the middle of a big stimulus we got a big tax cuts and more federal deficit spending on the other hand that kick is gonna fade away but the IMF is going further than that says Kirkegaard\nThey're basically predicting that the whole premise for the tax cuts which was that they would stimulate private gross yeah I'm just saying it ain't happening\nAin't happening in the medium to long term specifically the Federal Reserve is also raising rates which will be a drag on growth but Maurice up spelled director of research at the IMF made a special point of mentioning something else that could hurt growth prospects for the U.S we're downgraded\nIt's twenty Nineteen growth forecast owing to the recently enacted tariffs on a wide range of imports from China and China's retaliation China's expected twenty Nineteen gross is also marked down\nThe current sugar high in the U.S economy and stimulus and the Chinese economy are hiding a lot when that party calms down trade barriers and terrorists which are growth slowing taxes are going to start showing up in the data the IMF says\nAnecdotal evidence accumulates on the resulting harm to companies\nFinally emerging markets developing countries they had a real rough this year and maybe in for worst ahead Matt slaughter is

regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage which may well be marketplaces Renata Sago reports now and have privacy breaches might also had Google where it hurts\nWhen the Google Plus bugs surface in March it was an inconvenient time to be a tech giant with a data breach on its hands Facebook was in the middle of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and was trying to fend off new regulations Google

financial crisis and the recession that followed ten years ago but\nBig picture the housing market in this country when her fluid and with it all the carefully structured investments that had been built on that market winter flu is well at at the bottom of all of those investments were mortgages mortgages issued by the millions that\nMaybe some of them kind of shouldn't have been bank's pay billions of dollars in fines for their part in the housing mess that hit this economy a decade ago bank of America Alone paid nearly Seventy billion dollars for the bad stuff that it and some of the banks bought countrywide and Merrill Lynch\nFor some of the stuff that they did on that total seven billion dollars was designed for consumer relief which the bank could pay in a bunch of different ways in modified a lot of mortgages to try to keep people in their homes for instance\nBut it did some more obscure things as well as part of our project on the ten years since the crashed about a decade recall it working please Tracey Samuelson has part of that story\nOn alert is buying his first Tom ... single family in Schenectady New York with the stone front and big back deck as soon as he

transferred the home to a local organization in two thousand Seventeen along with thirty thousand dollars in other settlement funding to help fix it up that funding was important because they've

I'm On the climate change report\nYou know ... I Would uh share with you that I Believe consumers are very informed\nAnd if I look at the track record that we've demonstrated carbon emissions are down thirty percent and Duke Energy headed to forty percent and we believe that ongoing discussion with our customers on how to get there in a balanced way over a period of time is something that we find our customers to be very interested in\nWhat does it balance swimming is a is that you're trying to find your way between a coal and natural gas from solar and all that is out there I mean\nYou know our goal is to increase the amount of renewables on our system never compromising so it's when it's solar it's battery technology it's natural gas for Duke it's also nuclear and for many companies around the U.S its nuclear\nThis industry has never been an industry that pursues a single technology and I think that has been important for us to maintain affordability and reliability\nAnd as we sit here today I'm you know giving you a list of the resources that we are investing in but if we think ten years from now there's going to be more uh because we're also a believer in a research and development to bring more technologies to

uh and I think that's a challenge for any business particularly a legacy one like ours that we are moving quickly enough to accomplish what we believe in important for customers\nYou know it's funny to hear you talked about speed because that is an ever present issue in this economy and it makes sense when you're thinking about you know like Facebook or Snapchat or you know any of those others but the idea that a power company is is worried about that is sort of interesting\nWhat kind of I think the issue on speed is one of 'em\nYou know it's not in the next moment on my making the right decision but\nIt is I I Am making decisions today that'll be important in twenty twenty five and twenty thirty and twenty thirty five so I Want to make sure that I've got a clear vision of where we're going to that as we invest we're moving to where we believe the requirements of customers won't be for that time frame\nOr it's only trust them with you that I haven't done a long time but I figure

really different they were full of people walking playing biking riding horses pushing carts getting on and off street cars and they were all jostling for the same space that kind of chaotic ballet\nBut then cars came along they're big they're fast they're made of metal and we're killing people\nBy the thousands last\nNew head of the day was filled with grizzly story crashes than cartoons of evil drivers depicted as grim reaper\nZ but then things changed car proponents campaigned to shift the conversation from deadly drivers to careless pedestrians it was the beginning of jaywalking\nJay and old saying was a foolish person from the country we would call them a hit gets an offensive term\nThe aim was to shame pedestrians for walking into the streets which the automobile backers wanted cars to own one of the first cities to make Jay walking a crime\nWas Los Angeles\nBy the Nineteen twenties the fast growing city had one of the highest car ownership rates in the country and drivers wielded their influence through the powerful auto club\nThe same when you call it a job your car battery\nRepresented the motorists and\nWanted to make sure that the streets were

Nineteen twenties is proof that what streets are for can be changed innovation he says is a powerful force the popularity of scooter and it was actually I think pretty good evidence that people are looking for something different\nAnd if we in two thousand Eighteen take the same kind of approach\nA reexamining our laws are social norms and our infrastructure\nWe can reinvent streets again and
