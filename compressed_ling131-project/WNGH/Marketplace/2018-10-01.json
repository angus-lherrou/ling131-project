O'Leary in for ... it is Monday the first of October good as always to\nHave you with us and we start today with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will ever result of much more happening right here in the United states that means\nUs MCA and this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\n... manufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it's it's unclear so let's take automobiles auto jobs there at the center of the rhetoric oracle of everything and the ... and ... were a lot of the jobs involved are so a few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right\nNow sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico or the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yep it was set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone right we say that in my house while the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make parts of Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and us bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent and since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China\nAnd more jobs in Mexico or let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen he talked about jobs one of the big focus here has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour so flat fit into this\nA wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour\nSo how does that fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour or more [noise]\nSo what uh companies do when we just got pushed up will sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in more software and more robots more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might well\nSo looking a little more broadly doesn't take up all of the tariffs against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table um it's what's here and what's not\nYet so right now we do have terrorists on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican still still subject to that and it's more complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration on that that's I'm a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\n[noise] since we're sitting here in D.C today what are the chances that song gets approved by Congress\nWell good luck Lucy predicting a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats could rural took the house rights and historically\nDemocrats had been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much Joachim NAFTA has had a long history questionable yet who is the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that says mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S M. C. A. the White House says the agreement is a quote we in for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he\nRuns lost his ranch is in ... Washington they grow apples and also hops you know for beer Washington state is a big producer of both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers we've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome back\nThey supposed to be here All right so based on what you know so far um how does this do you look\nOn so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course\nSo far hum how does this do you look\nI'm so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taken away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think that people around you um are you know X handling a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important market for us agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and\nUh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico ... to tariffs on us apples and yeah so now Apple's in this deal has no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the in the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nSo last time you were on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year as that ship friday sale\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good\nMovement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were imposed that movement slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWhen you look at that are you sitting here thinking this is Jess ... again or are there differences that you see I mean has just plan for you on the ground is it the same thing with a different name\nIt does kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us in our businesses um both hops in Apple's this looks a lot like a what we've had last few years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nThink we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe\nMexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops around around the world than I Would like to see 'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership\nThe ... would like to see 'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership a we've pulled out of but more of these types of deals would be very welcome to buy most of us and in our industry I\nThank you for listening to market place on Georgia Public broadcasting this this listener supported CPB a family of public radio stations all across Georgia including eight point five CPB at last huh\nEvery listener plays a vital role in ensuring the future of public radio that is what our fault phone drive it's all about your financial support makes everything you hear on CPB possible international and national news from NPR Georgia news from the previous award winning news team\nPrograms like marketplace wait wait don't tell me this American Life MORNING EDITION\nEverything you hear come from a listener support the measure up to you what's most important is that you participate now in the final days of this campaign please don't put it off any longer go now to G.

Detroit I'm not afraid of an apartment building a walk through the lobby and I'd entered a crackdown\nSo I just started talking to people in between there using drugs and asking them where they lived
