of this week economic news was was dominated by the budgets actually the budget deficit all seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars of it last fiscal year a Seventeen percent increase over the prior year that was on Monday and then yesterday\nPresident Trump said he wants to cut five percent from the federal budget next fiscal year instead of majority leader Mitch McConnell said he is disturbed by the deficit and blames Social Security and Medicare\nBut here's a big chunk of the increase in what we're going to ... every year is because the federal government is pulling in less tax
