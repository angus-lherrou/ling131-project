thousand dollars extra cost\nAnd twenty five percent tariffs on steel and aluminum the pipes are made from steel\nYou've seen actual quotes from our companies that we buy the steel pipes saying that they've also increased surprised by twenty five percent\nThese price hikes are getting passed directly to consumers in the form of rate increases on their water bills\nSo we're seeing you know about a

of that has led to retaliatory tariffs on China and other countries on our exports agriculture mostly full thing happens so fast you might reasonably conclude we could get out of it just as fast\nBut as marketplaces got tongue reports game theory suggests otherwise\nGame theory is the way scientists and mathematicians think about human behavior and interaction what should I Do based on what you

then trust broke down trade professor Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law says a decade ago Beijing began requiring U.S companies there to hand over their secrets\nThey're forced technology transfer violates the commitments China made when I joined the WTO that its level of IP theft is a violation of the intellectual property provisions\nWashington meanwhile broke trust by taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO rules the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on China\nGame theory suggests a couple of things one is it's hard to establish trust is broken into a trade war is actually a rational thing for countries to do it in their self interest here's how\nNYU business process I ruined sooner origin says the U.S interest is to tax Chinese imports whether Beijing responds or not either way Washington makes money\nThat China and pose a terrorist the U.S as best responses to see whether they're going to tax your impulse as well as China

the national equilibrium which suggests that a trade war of self interest is actually the norm in that cooperation and free trade is the exception\nBoth countries imposing status is the ... equilibrium of the game\nTo sooner origin this means a trade war could go on a while as in ten years now game theory does allow for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupt things said political change\nCould be the election of a new president and the United\nIt's allowed for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupt things said political change\nCould be the election of a new president and the United states that unfortunately has to be coupled with a similar willingness to negotiate on China's pot\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China together and create space for trust so Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provides new customers for your exports and outside third parties will be the free trade police\nTo it's giving a little bit of political cover to China to say we need to make these reforms in order to remain a member in good standing up the WTO we need to do these reforms\nAnd to provide political cover for DC is well someone else made me do this but she agrees with sooner origin that a sudden outbreak of trust is not imminent and that this trade war as game theory suggests could go on\nA while I'm Scott Tong for markets\nI don't know all the way out today about which chocolate lovers will
