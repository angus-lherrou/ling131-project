it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bay those act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax big companies\nThe bees act also known as the stop Bezos act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos the bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states an Amazon the idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages\nWell Amazon announced today that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this she's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\nReally kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers ah they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions and I should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States and the ... or ... about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers\nAmazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour\nBut even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Walmart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour that's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that\nDirection really I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier\nUm so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market\nAs Walmart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is\nTypes of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where this raise we'll have more\nBuying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses on their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets\nA would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement we're\nGoing to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred and fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you've said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut fewer of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trends when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if\nWages go up generally that's great but we have that experiencing some optics and inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much Thanksgiving\nAs the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit meanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it
