many loopholes they weren't actually paying close to that but for more tightly regulated banks the tax cut was really real\nSo that boost plus a temporary provision in the tax law allowing businesses to the doctor capital expenses now and not over the years as they please she means profits plus that that just raise interest rates again\nIt's pretty much win win win for banks says on the air Subramanian finance professor at UCLA\nBecause of the tax reform on because of the rising interest stripes and generally the economy is doing OK so all of these things are lining up in favor of the upper assistant positive impact on profits\nBut that tax cut is a one time windfall for the banks going forward they'll have to sustain demand some when there's no tax cuts and next year as corporate tax rate will be Twenty one percent just like this year and that could be more challenging mark mazer is an economist at the tax policy center\nAnd so if they want to see an increase in their earnings

recovered\nNationally about sixty four percent of households or owner occupied still five points lower than before the crisis\nYou might think that's healthy that too many people bought homes before the crash but Susan Wachter a real estate finance professor at the Wharton School says too much homeownership didn't cause the melt down it was how people paid for their homes\nMortgage lending is what drove the financial crisis and the resulting great recession\nYou know the second mortgages and cash out refinancing and exploding teaser rate loans considering what happened to Emily and Frito serve on tastes back in two thousand two they bought a town home in a Denver suburb for less than two hundred thousand dollars\nThey had wanted a thirty year mortgage with a fixed rate but their lender pushed an adjustable rate mortgage that started lower\nAnd us being young and not knowing very much set okay\nAnd for a while they did okay living on Alfredo salary as a mechanic Well Emily went back to school but after five years\nAre rate jumped gosh it doubled\nBy that time in two thousand seven the market had turned and home prices were falling when they tried to refinance at a fixed rate the bank said no they owed more than the house was worse\nSo we were left with either trying to sell their home or\nFor closing and walking away which is what we had to do\nYears later both thirty seven they're renting us\nMhm or\nFor closing and walking away which is what we had to do\nEleven years later boats thirty seven they're renting a small bungalow near downtown Denver and terrified that their landlord won't be able to resist the rising prices\nThere's uncertainty every year you know are they going to extend the least this year for us or is he finally going to sell the house\nThat instability is one downside of the decline in home ownership not just for families but for communities Laurie Goodman is co director of the urban Institute's housing finance Policy Center she says homeownership is also the primary way most people build wealth to secure their retirement and pass on to their children\nSo we want it to be available to those that are able to sustain it\nGoodman says well there's no ideal rate of homeownership it probably should be higher than it is today if credit standards were far too loose before the crash\nWe are actually way too tight now\nShe estimates more than six million people could've sustained homeownership over the past few years but couldn't get mortgages\nHomeownership and then for everyone but it's for more people than we're letting through the door right out\nEmily and Frito Cervantes hope to get through that door again Alfredo is a teacher now Emily just started a fulltime job as a health policy analyst but now
