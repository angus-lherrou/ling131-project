with them more willing and gnashing of teeth then these two seemingly simple words currency manipulation certainly comes up every six months Treasury Department is required to put out a report listing those economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage\nOr its currency manipulation the subject comes up every six months Treasury Department is required to put out a report listing those economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage but really here we are talking about one economy right China and as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not\nSay Beijing is manipulating its currency\nBut that did not end the wailing and the national over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he might actually consider changing the rules the department uses to decide whether countries are playing fast and loose with the foreign exchange markets to marketplaces Tracey Samuelson why all the for X held up\nAs far as current global economic issues do currency manipulation super high unless\nThis is not something that very many countries have done historically and not something many countries are doing\nDavid Steinberg professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins [noise] but if you worried as the president does that other countries somewhere to us than we do to them then you worry about the ways that exchange rates can make those foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere's a close relationship between currency and trade policies\nThing is that China isn't currently devaluing its currency for competitive advantage\nThey don't you know clearly meet the test of manipulation at the moment\nAnd anyway the label just doesn't pack that much punch ... at the University of Maryland\nIs kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics Derek scissors with the American Enterprise Institute\nAround where the president said he would call trying to crunch him and they put on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports more than one call him a currency manipulator and you know their reasons for that but that's not what he campaigned on\nWhich could put him on the defensive on the next campaign trail I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nDetour now to personal finance and that all important credit score that

marketplaces to replenish or has more now on who stands to gain from that\nIf you don't have a credit history it's kind of hard to get a credit score like it's hard to get a grade class if you've never taken any of the test so what if I could always doing instead with ultra psycho is looking at other information besides your credit history to figure out how credit worthy you are\nThat includes not having a history of negative savings and trained acting response\nSally Taylor is scores vice president if I go she says you have to volunteer this information willingly it's not automatic there are fifty three million people in the U.S who don't have a credit score students are immigrants for example\nIt's cooler will tap into another ten to Fifteen now and we estimate that fifty three now\nThat's of course millions more people for lenders to lend to answer if I go to score Taylor also says this will raise the credit scores for some people jak Gillis is executive director of the consumer federation of America\nThe folks that will benefit the most from there are those folks who have marginal credit scores or who don't really have much credit\nBetter scores can save people money they affect your insurance your car loan your mortgage now the question for any new type of credit squared though is is it accurate Jonathan ... is a principal a consulting firm ...\nSo it's very easy to create credit scores when the economy is going well in default or a very low where the robbers going to hit the road is really when we hit the next rough patch\nThe next recession is when you find out which loans should not have been made in New York I'm Sabrina short for marketplace that always the way on Wall street today ... name is volatility will have the details when we do the numbers\nAre in case you somehow haven't been keeping track Fifteen days until the mid term elections\nAnd while acknowledging that past performance is no guarantee of future results at the next two weeks or anything like the past couple of months who boys a lot of political money going to be spent the center for Responsive Politics figures five billion dollars from all sources is going to wind up being spent on the two thousand each\nBoy there's a lot of political money going to be spent the center for Responsive Politics figures five billion dollars from all sources is going to wind up being spent on the two thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from well shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplace adjusting how has that one\nOne of the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash and politicians\nThis is something that sort of arose out of there aren't as fortunate as being made\nOver the last few decades\nThat stand for political scientist Adam Monica he found that the total wealth the Forbes four hundred jumped eleven to fold since Nineteen eighty two and the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says\nPretty clear that there was a lot more money coming from very wealthy conservative\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's worth thirty four billion dollars and he's a staunch supporter of Republicans and pro Israel issues after giving Donald Trump twenty five million for his election he doesn't watch from the front row as the president celebrated the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem [noise]\nBusier Adelson and his wife have plenty of eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates but lately ... says many billionaires are leaning another way and\nOver time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going to the Democrats\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up\nBut like I said that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley Dustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million to groups like move on dot org can a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his let more people in general to contribute\nTo feel this is an emotional need for people to engage\nThat's ... next year in America that the political action committee run by one of the biggest democratic donors Tom's dire hedge fund billionaire from San Francisco you might know style from his controversial ad campaign to impeach the president which hasn't been uniformly popular with Democrats\nRepublican Congress ones in the\nAnd tires political groups are spending a hundred and ten million dollars I'm liberal causes an east coast billionaires are spending a lot to Boston based hedge fund manager sets Carmen recently announced he'd donate twenty million to help elect Democrats after years of supporting the GOP\nForeign New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged a hundred million to help elect Democrats that could prove useful as Bloomberg eyes a democratic presidential bid and twenty twenty\nContributions like Bloomberg is a pretty easy to track but then there's what's known as dark money\nThat could prove useful as Bloomberg eyes a democratic presidential bid and twenty twenty contributions Bloomberg's are pretty easy to track but then there's what's known as dark money\nThat we're seeing the spending side that we don't necessarily know who had actually behind it and a lot of the case that is\n... they I mean incredibly they did a managed to stay within the strict interpretation of the law although they they violated the spirit of the law one could say but yeah it's what they did was strictly legal um but it was it was ... and it was pushing the line for sure\nSo to the to the other half of the question then why did the Federal Communications commission what Sinclair do this show many times\nThere is no simple answer to that I mean the the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous monopolies to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for this a sort of fraudulent divested ... strategy\nThey ended up finding that Sinclair had violated some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent divest teachers and um they find the company brace herself forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair\nA word here in defense of the Federal Communications commission or Sinclair has one of the Tribune media for a while they had a deal and just recent well a number of months ago but recently in relative terms are determined to have sushi I did pie citizens are not going to let that happen the Tribune\nMerger was sort of a fascinating little window into the business in regulatory environment that has sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith end up Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of doing that\nBut what we've learned since then has Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort to ups\nBut what we've learned since then has Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort to appease their regulators and get their deal approved and they had had\nSuch success for such a long period of time they figure the odds were in their favor\nThe trick had worked in the past the number of regulatory experts I spoke with said well it's sort of one thing to try and pull off that trick with the champagne vegetarians when you're a much smaller company but once you are the largest company in the country and you are about to become either larger the government's going to take a closer look\nAnd even in this incredibly friendly environment what they were trying to do with so brazen that the FCC had to put a stop to it\n... a staff writer for the New Yorker running most recently about Sinclair broadcasting company also are you here every now and then find out what to do is excellent\n\nKnowing industry no matter how new or how potentially big issues is immune from disruption\nCast a glance now toward recreational marijuana if you would ... nine states including here in California home to what is widely expected to be the biggest legal recreational pot industry in the country and and this is not unrelated\nAlso home to much of the technological innovation in this economy right now David Weinberg reports on super but for pot it's after dark on a friday night a woman who goes by the name\n... is circling a luxury hotel in downtown Los Angeles\nHe's looking for a middle aged woman with long gray hair capri pants and a pink and white checker top\nI'm I'm pulling up and find a dialect and where are you standing\nShe stops in front of

hands a woman or white paper bag full of marijuana and the woman tells her to keep the change\nMarijuana is still illegal at the federal level so transactions like this are usually cash only and these days no big deal\n... as you can see it's the norm law\nThere's a lot of people around knowing really that's an eyelash\nAnother day and [noise]\nAny California now\nThere's a lot of people around knowing what I mean that's an eyelash\nDay in\nAny kind of thing yeah\nNow a month later ... whose real name is Mary and co ten is out of a job the dispensary she worked for the downtown Beijing group suddenly stopped its delivery service\nThey would not comment for this story but the margins for pot delivery are tight\nDrivers are not gig workers but they are for lifting ... state law requires them to be W to employees making at least minimum wage and getting benefits and digital disruption is also changing the industry one of the state's biggest players in the delivery space is a Silicon Valley startup\nCalled ... we're eases uh Los Angeles headquarters in Venice Beach David Mak is a senior vice president of public affairs for ... the company raised more than fifty million dollars from investors which helps pay for this office space and a luxurious home once owned by Angelica Houston\nHe points out employees sitting behind a wall of giant computer monitors\nSo the orders come through the ease platforms orders are then routed to a local license to sensory partner\nOnce that business receives an order ease software dispatches a driver who was an employee of the sensory not ease\nLast count asked earlier today there are approximately twelve hundred drivers with dispensaries that are on these platform\nOne thing you'll never see at ease as marijuana the company does not have a state pot license and never touches the product to stay clear of federal law enforcement [noise] back says ease makes money by charging dispensaries of feet and taking a percentage of every sale for dispensaries that don't have a lot of foot traffic delivery can be crucial\nBut dispensary owners Jared ... isn't sold he met with ease and was alarmed by the business agreement they offered\nSo it kind of look like we're going to take every part of your business and take no risk because they don't hold a license so it looked like a Trojan Horse\nCarlos says he's only wanted to sell products it endorses and limited his access to customer data but other dispensaries sees as an engine for growth\nYou know back in the early days it was you know really just we had two people in
