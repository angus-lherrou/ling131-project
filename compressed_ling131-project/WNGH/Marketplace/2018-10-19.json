got to start if you want to explain what happened in the past five days which is what we're going to do with it Lopez is a Business Insider ritual Abrams is with the New York times they're both in our New York studios everybody ... hey so let me let me start with you a will go back to Monday or the deficit figures\nHe's with the New York times they're both in our New York studios everybody\nAct a ... let me start with you a will go back to ... uh the deficit figures from the Treasury Department up Seventeen percent from a year ago seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it kinda seems a that those numbers have lost all meaning though they are\nWell sort of I mean everyone told Republicans is was going to happen and they did it anyway it um you know the the\nThe deficit is the difference between how much we're spending and how much we're collecting how that continuously gross\nFor some reason conservatives have managed to convince Americans that if we collect less money will have more money against all logic\nSo now everyone's and in the Republican Party saying we might have to cut entitlements because now we have this crazy deficit and more money is going to go to interest payments we can but everybody told them from the beginning that this is how it was going to look\nAnd uh it's just sad that we have this kind of weird cognitive dissonance\nBears mentioning here not for the first time I was ready or broken originally rooms of the tax rates have never paid for themselves [noise]\nAh right and so I think I think that that sort of the great irony in all of that says that um the tax cuts of the G O P push through which primarily benefitted or I guess you should say benefited corporation and a and very wealthy individuals the most\nThat in order to pay for those tax cuts or you have Mitch McConnell talking about ... to ... cuts to entitlement programs\nAnd I think that kind of goes back to the question of well why do we care about the national debt why do we care about the deficit um it wouldn't you spend increasingly more and more and more money you have the the calls to get rid of entitlement programs like Medicare Social security that kind of stuff\nAh those calls get louder and louder and louder because um you know the because of the Republicans are going to be ... at least right now advocating more for businesses and then for those programs\nSo cynical person might say [laughter] so what do they want to do from the from the beginning was make it necessary to shrink with federal and learn how to you and I pulled out let's\nBe clear Paul Ryan said this going on a year ago now right that that entitled then thought a month for the next thing but rich let me let me continue with completely foreseeable circumstances but now appear on our national arise and uh there was news this week or more trade unrest Wilbur Ross was in Europe complaining about the European trade deals\nOr the Chinese now that is another thing that has seemingly heated up again with Larry Kudlow saying things [noise]\nWilbur Ross was in Europe complaining about the European trade deals or the Chinese now that is another thing that has seemingly heated up again with Larry Kudlow saying things but we got hard numbers from deep BMW down in South Carolina it's these terrorists are going to cost them a half a billion dollars a year it's not like nobody knew this was coming\n[noise] yeah and I think especially going into the midterms people are really wondering you know how it's going to this going to affect really hotly contested races you have soybean farmers in Iowa that were really concerned about the price of their crops going down because of the trade war\nI'm ... President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a sort of his core constituents source centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help her in the Republican Party germs and\nI'm not who knows who knows right before we sat down here Mattel an ounce and it was going to have laugh so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so old now I have the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says this on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment slow we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... millions of dollars what's not below like\nWell except for some one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from those tax cuts\nActually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is an indicator that um maybe things aren't going as well as a\nAs people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow on and\nIt also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to that Joe uh enjoy the fun while it lasts ...\nOn the market thing which I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the ... and we haven't seen for very long time\n[noise] yes uh and it's really interesting because the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessors when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really ... and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and five financial and business experts would agree that the market sorry the stock markets are not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see\nI'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past\nThese are dramatic falls like a thousand points that I mean it is you're ugly\nProbably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past\nYear and these are mad at falls like a thousand other points that I mean it is yeah oddly enough and of course Trump used to treat that if that happened to president should be fired there is a diary Obama administrator is it a ...\nThere's a tweet for everything when you get the last word he got twenty seconds to do it just really quickly the fed minutes this week and and Jay Powell basically saying everything's fine we're gonna keep raising rates everybody stay calm\n[laughter] yeah I mean the you know there's no reason for him not to trade change course I think for the stock market again is not the economy and President Trump should have absolutely nothing to say about the fat so there's actually no reason for ... how to change course it's not in his data\nAnd the stock market should not be something that he's worried about in fact he is what the fed is probably looking at is topping a bubble\nAnd somebody's phone officers goes you've been doing this for a long time now turn your phones off\nIn the studio at Lopez's

Hi I'm Jennifer ...\nFor the complicated couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users and a court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair well in the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixteen ...\nThe pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair off in the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixteen ... says we are pivoting the video at Facebook and journalism to does what\nJournalism is what that basically and they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits but maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I mean I think for publishers this was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are they the face but kind of eating into traffic so in Facebook's has represented video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publisher I say OK how high man so they invest all these resources into doing video\nAnd then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writers and higher video producer is so this happened at places like a MTV News and having to block it as\nMike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nAre so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said wait where were these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they less impressive and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that they can play the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were saying with as many of your town [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go round here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe arguing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is as close if they should have been a seems like publishers worry a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd uh yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or oh I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um because of what Facebook's had to do\nI mean again it was kind of a case where\nPatients were changed and or oh I'm Sorry to use this word of pivoted um because of what Facebook should to do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media than dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think that this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped into both eat what does Facebook have to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took them a kind of building in twenty six team when these discrepancies kind of first uh emerge publicly\nBut I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that that it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters still pending in court and and everybody's going to have their day absolutely
