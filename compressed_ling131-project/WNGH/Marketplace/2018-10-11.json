weren't we haven't heard in a long time or what the what what's going on\nSo there's been a lot of speculation about is what I'm hearing is there a few things going on right now the Federal Reserve has been hiking the interest rates will know that\nThat makes it more expensive for companies to borrow money it can also slow down the economy and then there's the ... the U.S and China and all the terrorists that we've seen you know last month the U.S put tariffs on another two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese goods\nNow we've got ... on half of the stuff we import from China and that is making it more expensive for some companies to do business also we've seen indications that the Chinese economy is slowing its currency is falling all of these things can make investors nervous\nThe question is really why this is happening now is in today and yesterday this stuff has been going on for a while so that's hard to say\nAre as I said give me the context or image from big numbers right surgeon or points on the Dow uh a bunch of other knows that and there's computer down his will frame that formula would\nYeah those are scary numbers but you got to put this into perspective in terms of percentages that drops aren't so big so Thirteen hundred points and the doubt that five percent this sell off we haven't hit a market correction yet you know that's what an index followed by at least ten prevent uh and if you look at the trends\nThe Dow and the NASDAQ are both up by about ten percent in the past year the S. and P. that by seven percent so what I've been hearing from analysts is that at this point we're still talking about a bad couple a days\nArt I Will take that and we can run with it do me a favor though I'm a I'm spitball this with the copy of the

... on the market beat today Thanks thank you All right so we will turn out at three snapshots from the president of the United states three glimpses into his thinking on monetary policy interest rates in other words\nAnd what the Federal Reserve has been doing with them mainly as marketplaces Mariel cigar sitting right there just said raising them three times this year if you are counting and we are and so is the president\nWhich gets us to this first of all this from the president last night in Erie, Pennsylvania apologies by the way for the background noise\nThen this this morning from a call he made to Fox and friends\nYou know the Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute if that's all this that's ridiculous what they're doing\nAnd then finally later this morning from a bill signing ceremony in the oval office\nI think the fed is far too stringent and they're making a mistake and the south right [noise] and it's a despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do believe there\nSo if your business and economics journalist what\nDo you do with that because the president is just wrong the fed is not crazy or ... or stringent the central bank under both its current and immediate past chairs has been deliberate and transparent and measured as it sets about getting interest rates back to something near normal after a decade of keeping them at zero\nAlso by the way when I ask ... back in July if he'd bugs him win the White House poke them in the eye on monetary policy or whether it's going to change what he does he said if you listen between the lines here nah I had a great a colleague in\nMentor back in the day who used to bring meetings into focus by saying let's control the control so but we control as long as what we do\nWhat we do and and I just told you what we do and we're always going to do that's who we are it's always who we are going to be we're we're going to we're going to do our business in a way that's strictly non political\nWithout taking political issues into consideration and that you know carries out the mandate Congress has given us\nA we have the tools to do that we have a statute that allows us to do that in in a way that is independent of political considerations I'm strongly committed to it and so on my colleagues\nSo where does all this going to mention here that this whole thing we've been talking about past what five\nIn a political considerations I'm strongly committed to it and so all my colleagues\nSo where does all this going well there's a mention here that this whole thing we've been talking about past what five six and a half minutes whatever markets tumbling rates rising the fed doing what it's doing the president doing what he's doing is all anchored all of it in the knock on effect of one economic reality whose name\nIs inflation the fed as we told you would like to see prices rising by about two percent a year we got some new inflation numbers this morning and marketplaces Tripoli Adams has more on what they may or may not me\nThe consumer price index tracks prices for a basket of goods and services and August it was up a tenth of a percent landing at two point three percent year over year\nInflation is at a moderate level it's very close to where actually the Federal Reserve would like to see it\nAnd oh and teaches economics at Hamilton College I think that it's an endorsement of their current plan to continue to raise interest rates very gradually\nBut numbers are funny you could use those same CPI numbers to make a different argument economist or need to desk he at every court ISI sums up the counterpoint\nThe fed has a two percent inflation target these numbers are close to two percent why on earth would be be raising rates\nToday ski says the fed isn't just looking at where inflation is now it's looking at where it's headed plus the fed isn't all that attached to CPI\nMain piece of data they look out for their inflation targets is a different price in later called P. C. E. or personal\nConsumption expenditures which measures inflation a little differently take health care CPI measures how much you spend out of pocket p._c. eat tracks how much your healthcare costs everyone you the insurance company the government\nAnd says today's scheme PC looks at how people actually spend money\nThat takes into account that if the price of Apple's goes up a household might switch to buying pairs instead\nCentral bankers use both measures just wait them differently presidential complaints about interest rates probably light on the scale in Washington I'm Kimberly Adams for marketplace\nOn Wall street today was that expression oh you forget about it we'll have the details when we do the numbers\nTwo and a half percent today bond prices rose good this year old on the junior treasury note actually ... percent you're listening to marketplace\nMarketplaces supported by Krohn owes HR payroll talent and time keeping in one unifying system designed with the streamlined implementation approach for small and medium sized businesses across the globe learn more a grownup dot com criminals workforce innovation network\nAnd by Drexel University Drexel University is academic design and transformative cooperative education program prepare a visionary leaders to address the challenges of a changing world\nMore at Drexel dot edu slash ambition can't wait to hand by sea three I O T the software platform for digital transformation using artificial intelligence and I do teach to solve previously ensemble business problems learned more in the three I O T Don AI\nAnd the wake of this storm we're seeing mostly clear skies across Georgia when's will continue to taper as we head into the evening and we'll see lows tonight from the mid forties and the north to high fifties and the south and on the coast friday will be mostly sunny in a bit cooler with hides in the seventies and low eighties across the state\nFor ... comes from you our listeners and the high museum of art friday jazz returns on October nineteenth ... to Ali Ali blends African in Latin rhyme with jazz infusion into her signature sound tickets and details at high dot org\nDoes your busy life keep you from staying informed CPB has you covered you can listen live the G.
