what you pay for ... or more accurately getting what you don't pay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country to know that our infrastructure our roads specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas tax\nTo know that our infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even prove those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increased it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens with new taxes not everybody is happy about 'em and they have taken to the ballot with the anti tax proposition six coming to California voters a week from tomorrow\nBut as much Jed Kim reports from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road might make a real gas tax difference\nHe lied Lippmann has brought me to the corner of Venice in ... in downtown LA\nIt's next to the convention center staple center\nI Would highway highway yeah the one hand freeway right here and here the noises coming through um [noise] is with the transportation organization called LA\nHe's against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary\nLipman says the state has a backlog of a hundred and thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment in roads and bridges [noise]\nLess safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we are part investing in state and the way that we need\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred thirty billion dollar hole\nBy raising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents almost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop six campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement\nThe politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money\nSo we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it but even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these types of having been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason can be seen directly across that street\nIn downtown LA at a Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrid another fuel efficient cars\n... is out on the law joking with other salesmen\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of the guy\nTouch them and nine cuts coming for the first day looking putting a again and they're fighting it some\nGot

five like minded soldiers in Spring Hill which are showing basketball is true of course I'm with us and you can or the best guess would you regret\nThe way that the the building is designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and you know when you hear the basketball that kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if oh so there you go you know we are one of the players\nSo we'd rooms for any room right of course are over there the beautiful weight room jokes\nSo this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right this is where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us and and be part of what we're building and we've missed the playoffs every year for five years\nSo this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to it in terms of Lakers basketball has been the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated\nTo be back to what they're used to it in terms of Lakers basketball has been the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nOr I don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view a little brown and ... and Magic Johnson director best reporter and you know Kobe in on the other best for grits have you guys have the conversation on yourself about look\nThis isn't going to be rebuilding [noise]\nUm yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball was that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight mile so we've had three coaches and three years you know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was\nNot matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more to push all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business suit on Saturday So too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose forced to read an surgery was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away\nThan commissioner David Stern called me and he said Jeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground who said oh yeah when we looked like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother and I ask him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids I think the

interviews about how this is a family business shows first couple of years when the commercial recalls her and says don't blow it with the family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was it was\nVery very difficult um you know my dad kind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant she said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates\nAnd making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to an accomplished what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider investing his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke them your question about about making the change from prior management and your brother you started with a number of years did you wait too long\nThat was my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because\nI did wait too long um as you can hear
