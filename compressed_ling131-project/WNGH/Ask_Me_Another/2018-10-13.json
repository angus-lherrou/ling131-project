it's a huge ensemble cast where everyone supposedly liked each other uh what is the secret ingredient just\nJust be around women [laughter]\nHave every wouldn't be a woman [laughter] and I\nYou know from experience that it's a really great environment you know it's so funny 'cause people I Would assume like the opposite ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past it's like catty women riding\nHis you know the scale is the competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable and groups of women in spaces where it's like\nFemale run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really love being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and you were forced to basically fend for yourself\nHow did you manage yeah um so\nI you know I think I had a very clear I'm\nAt a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present in our household and so\nI was just always sort of like an outsider looking in Ashley because I was the only one in the family who was documented who is a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had it I'm very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going in\nWe I grew up very confused but I always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever\nHappened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that didn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know a figure all everything up and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story\nWas ... I thought maybe my voice could be an asset stare at it that way because\nEspecially because of the ... the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and on different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and\nThe experience of millions um I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really\nThat easy it's not that we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see if I Move the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nWas it was like cats out of the bag and they had to do all this work [laughter]\nSo I was like I'm so tired I'm like oh we're struggling and all he would like nobody wants to give me a job you know unless it was you know some drug dealers girlfriend on and and here I Am putting myself in his vision now do all this work on top of this work\nYeah and it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my family divided and now you not only have this book but you've decided to\nPublish it was being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah and that it is called my family divided one girl's journey of home last and hope what is different about this version\nUm it's just like an easier read like easier than already the easy book I read 'em and why do people come up to me all the time it's like last year book I read it in one sitting\nHere's an already that easy book I ever heard of 'em and why do people come up to me all the time it's like last year book I read it in one sitting it's easy arenas\nYeah I I uh the younger students [laughter]\nThose are the students have been responding to the story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult time [noise]\nSo yeah that is why you found it easy [laughter] and now this may more your story is being developed as a television series well trying okay\nI'm In talks right now of developing on either a series or a town I'm I can take in many different directions that sort of like when I'm I'm getting into right now animated series on ... yeah yeah I Want to make it into a children's book actually I'm very interested in that and then you know\nOr the explorer doses [laughter]\nOn the next hour do we need a guy you stop at nothing to eat yogurt company business budget would any self respecting entrepreneur does I called my mother\nAnd I borrowed thirty thousand dollars from\nThe Planet Money we look for ... weeks to annoying\nHour of economics and innovation Planet Money and how I built this\nMoney and how I built this on TV\nSupport for G.
