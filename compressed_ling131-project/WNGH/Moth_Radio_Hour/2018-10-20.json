was basically the reason ... was invented [laughter] and after all my deep dives that was ready to go\nI started the invitations\nI hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation\nAnd I'm now than an envelope with vintage stamps I picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited\nSo my dad got a salute to the military stamp then I had just scour ... for a vintage WC Fields for a funny friends uh I may have some Still Alice is leftover pure fantasy Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache so I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my weddings okay like I created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's wedding veil\nAnd she went along with all of this [laughter] she actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the mixed matched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little talk first for the twelve cake we were going to have\nThis twelve I'm a big believer in cake so\nHe cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle composed it an orchestrated it and send it off to the band and we got prepared for our big day was going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but [noise]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which isn't my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years when the day of my wedding

would bring us the same good luck and we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his hometown in his sister's back\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung olive twinkling lights and the trees and decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played bell I had done for the event\nPreparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season\nI was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins into the shapes of swans when the tornado sirens went off\nAnd then came the rain\nAnd then hail and wins and it knocked all of the table over and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud\nSix months of making them every night and they were destroyed no one saw any of it [noise]\nLuckily I was marrying a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way up\nWe had invited all of these circuits people but we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent\nSo with the big top and we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter

feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing\nFavorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some\nShowed up and apparently brought a stomach virus but I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies [noise]\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me\nThe day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies [noise]\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me was that my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there and\nProbably the step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself [noise] but he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called him\nAnd he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing [noise]\nHe chose not to come to my wedding\nAnd that will always be true\nBut I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top he looked at me and said your dad should have been here [noise]\nAnd he should have been [noise] and then maybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise]\nAll of our hamburgers fighters just went up in flames [noise] but\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm and finally passed by I mean a star friends singing a song from ... to do and and also how some pains jump around [noise]\nAll it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle policemen and specialty cocktail I have made [laughter] which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nAnd the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either\nBecause I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that\nWe shouldn't have gotten married\nThere's some things even cake can't fix\nI hadn't been so caught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that\nThere are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what\nAn olive the preparations I Would have realized that\nThere are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nEven though it began with the storm it didn't

and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now\nHave this [noise]\nDo you want to have a baby [noise]\nSilence he turns around and I see that he is laughing at me\nBecause it's the stupidest idea you've ever had [noise]\nNo I don't want to have a baby [laughter]\nHis defense uh we had our hands full we were actually already parents a\nOne year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids and they came to stay with us for a little while I'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley an Riley had just become final they were a just\nIt came to stay with us for a little while I'm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley an Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just starting to get that taste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth\nUh this is in some kind of a feat of modern science or I'm just transgender uh for me that means that I was born female I'm I was raised with a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body and\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem um and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive\nA and I could transition and that could be happy [laughter]\nUm which is what I did from [noise]\nI started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine which just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby [noise]\nUh and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything's who have given birth to happy beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and if it was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah and I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer [noise] um so eventually he did say ...\nYou know ... uh and I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer [noise]\nUm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying\nA and a few months went by nothing happened um and I started to think maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that\nI woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nI had read all the pregnancy books you know everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refused I think the pregnancy test and then just made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant\nAnd it was going to be a baby you know but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick an even buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\nI'm Haley and we'd been toddlers when they came to live with us so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly I'm\nAn all of those ah markers of femininity you know everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on to my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like ... my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the thing that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life\nSo that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just let everything else go\nAround this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly um and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um\nAnd that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media and I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story\nUm because yes there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there's also a joy\nTransgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people of color\nBut for all of us there's also joy and love and and resilience and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready [noise] um and we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say like go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that um [noise] CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe just as good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nLike trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trans um a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve well also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story\nI became really good friends with the ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly cherry woman", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "20"}
