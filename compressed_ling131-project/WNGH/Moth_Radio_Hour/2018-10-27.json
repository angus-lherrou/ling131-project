getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone Ian soldiers who really were good for much and then there's another couple of journalists were driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us but their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they\nArgued about whether to kill us [noise]\nI tried to get ready\nI didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt at all I thought\nAnd the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole the double it comes out of\nYou know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I knew it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us I thought what does it turned eighty inside those holes and there are so small\nThe thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them\nCouldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us [noise] and we drove back to Freetown\nI kept going back for more I kept going to more wars\nI felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it\nI remember the first time I froze\nHere you go to war you think do you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war\nAnd sometimes you are brave but then other times\nThank you you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war\nAnd sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not [noise]\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo [noise] twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time\nBut at this day was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face [noise]\nAnd when you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at\nBecause the sound the bullets make when they go past your is pretty subtle\nAnd then the gunfire arrives moment later I\nGuess I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy [noise]\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head\nAnd kick dirt in my face it that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle\nYou don't even want to think about it [noise]\nUm and then it's all you can think about [noise]\nWhile I was paralyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and did everything that was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest [noise]\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up under the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington\nPhotographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap any graph stuff he throws my camera to\nMe it goes by bullet proof Bessie grabs his stuff is throwing image of soldiers to the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine\n[noise]\nTim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave [noise]\nLot of flavor than me\nThree was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know [noise]\nA lot braver than me\nSomebody was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men are free to love each other on reserve is like without it being mistaken for something else [noise]\nThat was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible as us in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan\nSo we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my ... on this trip [noise]\nSo I had to go home to kind of heal up So Tim took the next trip\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot\nLot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded [noise] at one point um the American physicians got overrun they dragged off a wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that seemed broke his leg\nHe'd at ten thousand feet up in the car with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot and says well as broken and we can't get a matter of fact we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get hammered\nAnd new Tim knew that\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a
