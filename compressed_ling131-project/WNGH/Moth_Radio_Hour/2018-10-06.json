gotten negative connotation and I had\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born kid of immigrants\nYou're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nLearn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them\nBecause I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me\nMy mom works odd jobs in sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brother's a take turns massaging his back\nWhile\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American [noise]\nSo I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China [noise]\nWho are rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nWe're here in America I thought\nAsk that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause a rocket strike [noise]\nBut I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was\nThirteen I was so excited to watch a PBS documentary become American the experience [noise]\nPeople that I seen three people who ever looked like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power\nPeople that I've seen three people who ever looked like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee that yellow power ranger\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise]\nI'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life\nThey were marching for this man named Vincent Chin\nVincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit\nOr Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs they fought\nThe guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral and said the next week\nTo get two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and pay three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine next people are now saying if this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together\nAnd for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American\nI never heard that term before and Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together\nSo my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nHave all these questions who is he how is he relate as ... like a cousin of a cousin of a cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nWho is he how is he related to ... like a cousin of a cousin of a cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nThat she didn't look like he had wanted to tell me the Bush I think she felt she had to tell me\nHow could I ask all these questions\nAbout a murder man and our family\nI had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking at articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie\nThe movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother lowly Chicken Little each and when all over the nation under Phil Donahue show\nCrying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes China set up the filmmakers of boyfriends and she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's\nSome moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because the woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nShe was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself\nHave to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family a someone who spoke up\nTo be a pot again to be a busy bought a curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who will each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer that\nAnd like I have to find out who will each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit [noise]\nMy friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery tooth even sanctions grave\nWe she drives us and we find Vincent ... name on a tombstone lowly tens name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a
