voter last I don't know if you've heard about this but\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rules at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years under that Obama is trying to remember\nTo vote for him\nThen a last July you were taken off the voter

privilege\nHe says he'll take is on to re register so she can vote in the governor's race [noise]\nWe analyze all the people purging Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand removed for not voting and not responding to notice\nThat we don't know how it breaks down by race but if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor\nWhen it comes to the purges Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there's this illusion let people register all the way to election day\nAt least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robin ... is a Republican

the issue\nWouldn't because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote you want\nPeople who have been following the election to some degree uh who knows what the issues are and

it distorted the electric [noise]\nI don't know how you\nDescribe it frankly I'm at a loss all all that but if you don't know on October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November\nYou're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if the presidential election and it back to presidential election that don't get you out I don't know what is going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's a fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls Ken wins if the racial breakdown of voters stays about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough you have to\nPolarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the polling today there's almost no one decided\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W.

finding out your name is on the list\nBut even if you get into the booth you vote might not be properly counted [noise] Georgia is one of five states that rely solely on\nTouch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts have learned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper\nHighly complex computers paper\nIs a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for spoon to target county Web sites in Georgia [noise]\nA lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hacking Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country are the people in

you touch litter and then it's become pressing the\nImage is the one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning and use that as a ring came [laughter]\nThis is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail from Logan and other cybersecurity tight that's a major red flag\nIn fact the aries had been criticized by technologists basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again like last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security\n[laughter] she oversaw the state wide roll out of touch screen machines in the early to thousands and I'm like every cyber security expert I've ever talked to she's critical of paper ballots\nFrom dead people voting to ballot boxes are showing up in the bottom of a lake or they're just so many opportunities\nLimited truly only by one imagination to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even the Logan findings for troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly that burned heart is a PHD student at the University of Michigan [noise]\nShe studies the arteries and their vulnerability\nThat says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant\nShe studies the arteries and they're vulnerable to these\nThat says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you inject information or inject basically our a virus into any part of this tree the way it's set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the truth [noise]\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data a second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable\nOne of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom on the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm elections\nJudging Amy Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian Kemp she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nThe court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system\nBy the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that\nHacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they didn't mean as paranoia the research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable system the machines that very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to said that change won't really make much of a difference and they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw\nTeam they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first you know\nWe know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the Russians are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to

R. ... this is reveal a mail it today we've been talking about voter suppression\nBut the facts from the center for investigative reporting NPR ... this is reveal a mail it to date we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud people are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nIn many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that there was like just so that is a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theory folks millions and millions of people\nThose claims have been totally ... one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that's typically are pretty sweep you off is he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nOr constitution bars or keep them from making\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything that you will with Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nSay big hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has his big national profile in conservative circles how'd that happen so called about\nIs a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people and question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that's dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who back to that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud caught claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this fraud could be swinging elections\nBut the way we know that that is not true\nI started out I could drew a bunch of little zeroes in percentages at you here but according to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning then\nIs at you here but according to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this well it's a major problem\n\nInterview cookbook with them or what was the looking person\nWell you know come on makes a really good politicians have good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term\nFatty and said it would be they use\nThe term off line as an actor to my lawn than you will thrill all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them it's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degree from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system\nIt's a massive voter tracking program\nUnder Kobach agreed to include more than half of the total voter registrations\nIn the U.S okay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free\nThey share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registrations and most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California did you call the secretary of state in Florida", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "21"}
