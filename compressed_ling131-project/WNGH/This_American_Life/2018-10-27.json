really missed my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone and um I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember yourself on that that was because I think it works both ways I think that we felt that that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded well\nHow desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] if only you knew he probably would not make but I mean people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I couldn't do it I was too shy

waiting for the other shoe to drop [noise]\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it up and she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it\nInterfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation\nWas that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd I know probably I did on a couple of people that they were my age [noise] but uh\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids loved me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh [noise]\nI Would be devastating if I heard anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go

that ... had hardly any dolls you didn't seem\nQuite as playful as other kids that I had that ... you get more serious in general no mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nOr\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I remember as a deceived us about each other or even if they had deceived us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we needed to about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said she must be remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house but there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen\nThat keep people lived differently than the

Israel\n[laughter] um\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to meet his nation [noise]\nOur our regular listeners during this American like might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\n... made me another sure\nUm there's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among

it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this\nRidiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl that kept them and being scared\nAnd confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean it was like maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary where when tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation may may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy\nI didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much ... every other aspect of my life\n[laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know it was a good way to deal with ... with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great\nI Wonder what the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel\nThat knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nThink this would feel so small to that sixteen year old\nThis would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course\nSo nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed and very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime ministers of Israel\nAnd and I would just think about my

you're petting little family and your small little apartment like\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I Want my for myself when you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty year old says you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah [noise]\nHe would be very very disgusted you heard this this radio peace it would seem like I had settled in the ... that way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student ... frankly studying trying it the New York Academy of art and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that she had gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box it was crude yes but the story sounded when Michael be like a story from this American Life\nNot for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio for this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music to here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIndustry that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity it's a pretty straight place [noise]\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nNot the sort of place you'd expect people to watch it guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident\nNot the sort of place you'd expect people to watch guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four\nThe beginning of the school year and we were\nUm [noise] for one night and we decided to go up to the quad and I guess basically got up on a on someone's back and he started yelling and screaming about\nHow he was a magnificent he was there and I'm actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I Am so dry it\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was pretty amazing\nA\n... a lot about it um it actually good for me thinking along a particular path\nGot talked about the idea one night in the dining hall who\nThe next day on the weight of class\nHe saw signs all over campus that enabled print\nMayan nine feet tall\nCome see giant man eight pm on the quad\nThat had no idea who put them up\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nThat decided he would go to the cloud at this time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to
