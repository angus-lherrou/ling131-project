[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers but I Know I'm I'm I like uh do you want to know I'm calling\nAnd I was Seventeen cars I started a year early I had I just wanted out indeed that I'd found out that I got the scholarship mhm\nContacts that nine\nWhy did you want to get off because my family wouldn't dysfunctional that my mom and it was pretty bad\n\nThe girl that I Lived with\nAt that time she was taken all on a truck\nAnd every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something and I I really do it much at all\nAnd it was really\nIt was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone and I was I guess maybe trying to substitute I think\nMaybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we felt that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded\nWell how was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't make but I mean people are complicated now what I really wanted to do would spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\nI mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy to know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo he sort of talk to us instead\nAnd then I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo he sort of talk to us instead

are passed it happened she just forgotten that odd witness part of it\nInterfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation\nWas that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was too kind back that because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family\nAnd that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh [noise]\nI Would be devastating if I heard anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ...\nParts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe person who's in Jordan deer for life that I remember\nAs he or she just as in ... and it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like\nI didn't think of myself as where it all\nBut Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWas anxious and bookish\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your rooms I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got to strike but it just seems like there were mostly books and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room and

I had that ... you get more serious in general no mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I memorized the deceived us about each other or even if they had the saved us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we needed to about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her talking to us in the face of hardship she said she must be remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen\nThat keep people differently than the way I laughed and that's what I did I Want to go from I Know\n\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at photos\nOr listening to recording or you can find someone who knew back then\nSomeone you haven't seen sense\nIt don't carry within themselves with the picture of you

Israel\n[laughter] me [laughter] um\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared its way to meet his nation\nOr or regular listeners during this American like might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp\nThat was right before I started writing this diary\nMe another sure\nUm there's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and well being\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and or watch out will generate here comes out of it was on Capitol\nHill while [noise]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership\n[laughter] no

I be living so badly\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel sure\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven\nI memorized the hope ...

fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effect\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become designer [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there is so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy\nOf you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who was you know having crushes and\nVeto a hopeless geek who can't get a girl or kiss him and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary where when tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation I mean maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy\n... yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much a mixed about every other aspect of my life\n[laughter] I Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be [noise] you know one of the great\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel\nIt knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old\nThat's would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel\nAnd and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day\nBiographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel\nAnd and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation or you know just have your petty little craft and you're petting little family and your small little apartment like\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want it for myself when you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty year old says you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah [noise]\nIt would be very very disgusted\nYou heard this this radio ... it would seem like I had settled pathetic\nThese days that writer for the\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student Hillary frankly studying trying it the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get him to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine and then\nTo edit the quotes that she had gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like stories from this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIndustry that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity is a pretty straight place [noise]\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers [noise]\nNot that sort of place you'd expect people to watch it guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant [noise]\nHappened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four [noise]\n[noise] beginning of school year and we were [noise]\nAnd then in Nineteen Ninety four\nThrough in the beginning of the school year and we were um [noise] for one night and we decided to go up to the quad and\n[noise] I guess basically got I'm On a on someone's back and he started yelling and screaming about\nHow giant he was a magnificent he was and I'm actually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it and uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was pretty amazing\n... if I bought a lot about it um it actually good for me thinking along a particular path\nGot talked about the idea one night in the dining hall who\nThe next day on the weight of class\nHe saw signs all over campus that enabled print\nMayan nine feet tall\nCome see giant man eight pm on the quad\nThat had no idea who put them up\nHe learned later that the giants were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nThat decided he would go to the cloud at this time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nGiant nana blooming boy\nI don't even know exactly what's something work you know I'm old I Am curious you know just the you know loud but just kinda weird [noise] you know sort of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This
