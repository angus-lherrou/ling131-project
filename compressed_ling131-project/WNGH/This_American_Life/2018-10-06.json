our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it and I bet you but may I spent a full week obsessively\nReading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nFrom to me this one feels the worst of all I think because he originally hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours in Maine both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting and then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us off or a week in that same state education and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nIncredibly sometimes those people\nBut even in moments like this one [noise] there are people who haven't picked aside [noise]\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide to have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our\nFirst act [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake or second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise]\nNo real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nAll those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable with all the w._b. the Chicago it's this American Life America stay with us\n\nOne judge [noise]\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the journal on Capitol Hill this last week turned on the TV and you'd see is tortured face to drag his decisions down to the wire over and over\nTo the undecided than seemed like a no when Kavanaugh was yes it was like wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill [noise]\nShe was with him in the days before and after the cabinet hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator\nAnd tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed its mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] staring at sleek peering out from the elevator [noise]\nHe just stood me up for an interview [noise]\nJust like these can be a little deceiving she looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tuned in this case though I think he was miserable\nHe just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get the elevator to get to the vote now he was you\nThen he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country\nFlick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination English confronted by a mob of screening protesters and the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled\n... was one of the two women and that confrontation play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change [noise]\n\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days\nLots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last\nTwo weeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks mind is not true first of all I saw him she just had no when asked about it by other reporters\nAnd this morning that they might also\nWe talked about it\nIt was the thing is just not the thing that convinced him as well protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers and for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before Lincoln I'd gotten an\nElevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of the story about Lindsey Graham before women jumped on the elevator with a war hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nWhat are you know we live in one way and therefore when we were you thinking what do you have to pay something is going to say the winning right now in the survivors\nWhat do you have to find something you're going to say that went in right now and the survivors\nAffect you and people like that\nLike making fun of themselves\nWe've talked about that before like slap him and his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge cap and I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided boots very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nYou know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would act one time he spoke and hearing you sounded just does ensure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that area and we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt as certain to\nGo out of this room today\nAnd go and just have a little humility on that trust\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here [laughter]\nThe night after the Ford cabinet testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't this off putting to him that they thought it might be to staff said they'd never seen him like this\nIt was agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nAny decision on a boat\nA debate\nA decision on a vote\nTo debates staff discussions late last night too and\nThat was that it was already raw [noise]\nIt happens just like he predicted\nAfter seven days of being treated as a Democrat\nOr at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP on Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for\nOn friday week announced his decision he's a yes on Kavanaugh I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging he would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car\nPeople are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am I'm presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI report [noise]\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people stuff [laughter]\nAnd the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nPeople that struck chocolate chip or all of our you know\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no aisle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert

political party and they have to act in a political way\nThe frame or just new there\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nUs how to structure that process\nI Do think ah\nIt has the obligation\nUh to recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity\nDo\nWhat you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThe church should be broadly read\nMy self was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about\nSouthern southern southern southern slanted a mess of it as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience couldn't hide\nA lot of it as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asking about a staple cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way [noise] funny he's a big talker and explain this job how it works\nUm just the nine of us\nUh we begin with an order\nOf seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nAnd if the case is one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision\nOr the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just\nReverse from it's a question of the rationale\nReasons that your gifts\nAnd let's say it's five to four\nOr five in the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all\nWe realize one of us will have to write an opinion\nThat commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nAn opinion that explains\nThe principles of war or the principles of the constitution\nThat controls the result\nWhen we issue that opinion in say an unpopular case\nWe draw down on a capital of trust we make a withdrawal on the trust that in the public has it in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish that trust\nBy hearing to our judicial owes by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nMy story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI think one more story I don't know it just tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nI think it was a Saturday

to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us from the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer\nUp until the article was published [noise]\nThat was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who read the article [noise]\nFearing his co workers made over here he took the call outside behind his office building [noise]\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI Fox incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone\nWho choose life imprisonment when in fact all I had to do was declines of death penalty and that's all it would have taken\nThe death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast\nSo that would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten life in prison without parole\nThe cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI

sentiments of forgiveness\nForgiven me\nIf I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I

know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that\nAnd like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nAlready did begin to apply but I didn't have the courage to finish her son to\nSort of you know there's so much pain in there and [noise]\nFeel like I really read things um [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email and execution date was that\nThe state

which reads in part\nWe do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son\nThey are innocent of is deet based on\nAll stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son\nThey are innocent of is deet based on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email\nBut he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want [noise]\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nNot doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not

writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nChills or forward original email to spin the once he sent two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about\nWhen I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness ever even uses the word\nInstead it's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nI don't mean I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get back to ... some\nSome of the stuff

to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family memoir\nVows to
