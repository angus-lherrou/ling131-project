P. B. school trying to do the right thing the school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with a gun pressure on the boxes [noise]\n\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids are out to destroy them or Ohio that let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nBut the people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team is a public watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations over the school\nI saw the run a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and they get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nFire during these drills [noise] so\nThe first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into this\nYou had to put your finger on the sensor fingerprints\nAnd it's a little tricky\nYou know there's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John\nRunning from his office starts by the\nHe's got a gun he's ramble for that\nRunning from his office starts by the\nHe's got a gun he's rambling ... bass he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds one\nOf these shootings and other to kill\nNot enough of this way\nWell Mary wearing elementary wing\n[noise]\nMature waiting to building also has middle school and high school right so the\nPrinciples running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's locked this happens automatically wonderful goes into lockdown so he and the two guys with him are stuck ... keys and he's trying to find the right one [noise]\nYou're trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nReal\nSure we'll [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there\nThat's the goal the exercise they got\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWasn't great that\nWas the attorney her first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nSo controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to the fight\nI talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school\nHe says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one they came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force mhm so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away\nYou worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun in the handle the dough\nAnd which is different\nSo I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and how to handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you should have gone that's pretty scary it's scary to me [noise]\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nHow close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target Cindy can mess\nI Can't miss\nBecause they're Simon is [noise]\nThere's a possibility somebody else getting hurt [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nOf course she might have to shoot one at a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\n\n[noise] the shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do\nLike staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish\nIf she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who invented something that actually seems to work and help\nFrom the BBC Chicago this American Life America ... stay with us\n\nEdwin ... will never be pretty sure that's trying to figure out the best ways\n[noise] [noise] like one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for a gunman there's an example whether that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust among before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than work day I mean they knew what to do we knew what to\nEven still even with that and he\nDid the training they received to save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi in winter park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOne she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for everything that is what a code black and this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the cat and mouse you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\n\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused and she plans to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's\nThey they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building I'm really was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in yes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing there were terrified people reading and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that are\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught\nYou can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\n... actually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught\nYou can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise] [noise] [noise]\n... in her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway [laughter] [noise] the group is small enough to sit in the supply call that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move their lungs\nAnd cause it it was hot and dark except students faces led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she tax to send a text to us that says there's a shooter there's a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my window is blown out and then she told her she had been graced by a bullet she was grace in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the cause it without having a light on and when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was open with the key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not the comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police ever said this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\n[noise]\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't power that in training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops and so I just very slowly\n... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThe up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWas uh told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken political that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls that closed\n'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nBases that teacher who's ... is she survived [noise] got Beagle and the room next to Stacy is at the same things stay seated waited\nA little with the door open one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way what\nIt was very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare anomalous and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study\nAnd they both told me that having a playbook for what to do helped and\nNow I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and\nNow I Move us all to a closet\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of the\nWays they could have been better prepared and\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom\nAnd training on how to treat bullet wounds with it\nDoes actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what the fact of and these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best\nCheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done but she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done at Douglas\nLike paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done at Douglas\nLike paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much\nIt's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso ... all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAnd all I I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise]\nVersus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise] keeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet\nBut the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting and sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nTold her about actually occurs how sheets the doorway grabbing a dozens of students from ever it was a break\nFrom her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids\nThe problem with that and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably and in that situation at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training of Douglas was barricade in your door\nBasically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull the kids in her room from the hallway\nBarricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school button hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say not great\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nI don't know exactly and say it's not great [laughter]\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and now now one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all they have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school [noise]\nTo traumatizing for kids don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all what my daughter to know everything\nOh God I'm so sorry we're we're ... ...\nIt's okay honey you're doing it now\nOkay his name is ... he graduated last year there are costs to set up for three people he knew well\nOne of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved he said she always tried to be strict with him looking ever keep 'em that fought for very long\nJust breeze taken nice de\nTake a nice deep breath\nAfter a few minutes he's cut his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops\nAnd he wants to take action somehow\nYou hadn't had suddenly switches gears start filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know the answer is going on in the world is ... district for jurors doors are still able to do\nNow he plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year I'm somewhere safe houses are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment\nIn a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year so we're safe houses are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks I personally by however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make guns like bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several destination lawsuits ... Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control of that and he accused him of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nBonnie got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stepped in and broke it up\nI reached out to Jones through one of his lawyers who declined to comment\nThat conspiracy theorists there's truth or ... or ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting it can get dangerous for after that Philips is on gave\nInterviews and Aurora he got death threats that had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail to hoaxes or one of the things that Philips has warned parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\n\nAfter watching Lonnie and Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again\nCancer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep with her home in Texas\nThis was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado\nAbout a half hour after the movie started\nTo find called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone there was\nScreaming [laughter] [noise]\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was [noise]\nScreening just [noise]\n... screaming in the background\nPanic and he said um there's been a shooting\nLike what is he talking about because Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster\nAnd I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nTo why isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and took to never heard before\nMoney found Sandy in the living room fighting down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting Sandy Hook or twenty first graders insects educators died two days later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings at that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nThat when they arrive at a community center in Newtown than he says they felt nervous uncomfortable\nMaybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces [noise]\nThey said that's what we look like five months ago\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving but they're not really there [noise]\nThat's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want\nI realized\nThat's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality\nLooking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nPhilips has said there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away\nFrom where they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents that last kid suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThe moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need\nTheir new expert than what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to [noise] to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids voted to raise money to get your child's body home if you live out of state [noise]\nHowever this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend [noise]\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal light ... rather should face should drill Seamus you were ...\nYou know let me explain something to your right I'm not the same person who will be the shooter as we're obsessed with this will you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nWe believe are closest to disappear\nWhich makes us informal support groups even more crucial\nWithout support looks like over time\nWhat it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple of from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland Hanukkah in that store at\nAnd let them at their house or something was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis on a twin scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nBut said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less watch Scarface together\nToday the shooting ... phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd been missed\nAnd watch Scarface together\nToday the shooting mentioned on the phone calls in tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who mash next to this corruption by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from Nick\nThey went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rings you jumped in and gets Nick calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning we see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from nature and\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like we we couldn't even find yourself and you know and that whole thought that he was somewhere else and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to her house\nAnd then they told us the news\nThat he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital it'll just like a nightmare [noise]\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries which did not", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "17"}
