regular day job is the host of serial which just launched its third season and I could see all kinds of great things about their third season and why should done with it but I Will not right now instead of just trying to show about Sarah [noise]\nThis is Hannah Oh hi this is Sarah from this American Life Hi how are you I'm good thank you how are you good before we go any\nFurther from WB easy Chicago it's this American Life I'm ... sitting in for Ira Glass and you're about to hear this story\nThe same way I did blind all I Know is that it's going to have a coincidence that\nHave no idea what you're about to tell me so oh yeah and I land on me\nA story is I was a freshman in high school um at Bozeman high school in Montana [noise] yes I and I was in the orchestra and it was early in my freshman year and\nI had made friends in high school but didn't really have extra friends yet and we were taking an orchestra trip [laughter]\nSo that was a little nerve wracking\nWhen you're a freshman disqualifies the demi crisis among bus ride to Seattle chairing a hotel room with someone you don't know\nBut there's this one girl Lindsay she had to have friends in common [noise]\nSo they decided to pair up room together and ride the bus together to be orchestra friends\nSo um we go to Seattle and we're like it's awkward you know because we're like new friends trying to get to know each other and um and on one of our free days they send us to the Space Needle I and I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle I live\nThere's that like carnival area all around it uh-huh and we're playing the little games all around there and we won the super troopers\nIs that like carnival area all around it and we're playing the little games all around there and we won the super troopers to know what those are no [laughter]\nI'm there like the little plastic soldiers that have a plastic parachute and you're supposed to drop them from somewhere and the plastic parachute sort of expand and\nOh what did you ... really\nI didn't quite believe how about this but she looked at that is true Cooper troopers\nI just did a Google image third okay but troopers and I'm seeing images of the little guy is the way it is it a generic name or is it the brand name I think it's a brand name I think from what I'm seeing here imperial super troopers\nSinus or general coup a trooper yes [laughter] exactly\nBack to the blonde hair Hannah and her new friend Lindsey go to the top of the Seattle Space Needle to try out their prices\nSo we we got in the little elevator and ran to the top and ran to the edge and through the through but troopers over the edge because there's nothing to stop you real really yeah and we were just like in heels of laughter and it was we thought it was so hilarious and um it's sort of broke the ice and our friendship\nReally enhance become best friends all through high school to senior year four years later another orchestra trap it's time to Reno nevada Hannon Lindsey or in their hotel room studying\nAnd so when ... sitting at the desk in the hotel room in Reno nevada end up poop a trooper comes flying out of the sky and land on the window sills\nRoom where we are and we both like we couldn't we couldn't believe it when you open the window\nAnd we grab the pooper true Britain we ran into the hall to try to like find other people that are just are like we saw what had been playing a trick on us but no one knew what we were talking about no one even remember the thing in Seattle and so I still to this day I don't know\nWhy that happened\n\nEvery once in a while we get pictures like this at the radio show coincidence stories they don't really fit in to our usual every week we bring you a team format we've been sending them aside wondering what to do with them\nI mean so much to people\nI don't know it felt like it was about or French [laughter] you know it was just it felt you know I it's\nUm [noise] I mean so much to people\nI don't know it felt like it was about or French [laughter] you know it when it you know I I Am not someone that believe in God really but it's a little bit like an act of God or something like just sort of cosmic larger about a\nFamily and hit us so we got enough of them we could put them on the radio as their own thing so we put out a call to listeners send us your coincidence stories and you did hundreds and hundreds of you did\nWe rent at least Thirteen hundred coincidence stories interviewed dozens of people\nHere just a few things we've learned\nHere most prone to coincidences when you're young teens or twenties lots of coincidences involve your grandmother you're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands coincidence is also happened to you in or near airplanes or on Craig's list for many of you coincidences where the answer to your prayers are how'd you find you're missing bike\nAlso they're coincidences hidden in your name your keys you're close your address we heard stories about a lost roll of film discovered coincidentally in the stomach of a decomposing high enough about the man who got his favorite T shirt back from strangers ...\nIn Slovakia\nHow about the woman who is dating not one but two mark Steven Anderson's at the same time\nAbout the student whose car broke down in rush hour on a busy highway and the one person who just happens to stop who comes to a rescue it's her dad lives for hours away and one of my favorites from a woman named Jill Peterson who felt nauseated on the subway in New York City\nAs they pull into the second avenue stopped there is a garbage can perfectly positioned to help her out\nSo the trainers and and be lining up for this can and I get a core of my I cannot see like another person heading my direction kind of like going for the cancer\nAnd uh you know it's it's all coming up and [laughter] and growing up and then throwing up in the can is coming apart they start throwing up and they can see that we're both like animals teenage sleep barking into this can\nHave aged and [laughter] and we kind of look at each other like wow\nI don't know how how are you feeling like I'm feeling a little bit better now like Egypt\nOnly way to survive throwing up in front of a subway car full of strangers have a nice girl your age do it with\nWas the only way to survive throwing up in front of a subway car full of strangers have a nice girl your age do it with you\nAnd numbers so many coincidences with numbers\nOne woman told us how she was at Thanksgiving with her extended family and I suddenly realized that six of them had the exact same number of letters and their names twenty three letters\nMichael aren't there the antibody\nMary Elizabeth ... William Arthur at the body\nCameras a guide them all doing surveys people their phone number it's obvious the guy who surveying starts to make up a number he says nine three three\nSix\nWhen he read out that last number said\nEight and I try to step back for a second but I was cool and I said no sir I'm sure that's not your phone number and why is it that my phone number is it because that's my phone number\nBut it's my life on the phone number is made up is actually my phone number\nThese stories reminded me of an old Chinese saying I once heard\nActually I wanted a couple of weeks ago and I have no idea how old it is but it goes like\nThis ... ... that's my friend un U. N. D.\nFood shelter ... and what isn't any if there is no coincidence ... stories\nNo coincidence no story to imply that\nOf course life's Earl\nDeveloped in the ways that we can predict so is it like if you heard his story with a coincidence afterwards he might be like no coincidence no story like that right yes just the expression you use it to call it like a corny thing to say\nMostly I think of no it won't be as do you ever use it [noise]\nWhen I'm corny yet [laughter]\nOr the risk of being corny I'm going to say at today's show no coincidence no story while the man's a way we're going to sneak these coincidence stories on there all the stories you'll hear today first aired on our show twenty three\nAnd they're all verified true stories that my colleague hid from me until the actual interview so wouldn't spoil a surprise\n[laughter] and he had proposed to her\nAnd I'm going to slow this down in fact just to let it sink in Palin's mother had almost married Stevens father his late father actually he died when Steven was Seventeen how this all came out was that after they had dinner they went back to Stevens apartment when they were looking at Steven's family photograph\nSo you know my future mother in law's flipping through the album and she sees my dad and so she asked a yo what was his name and my mom tells the name and you know my my future mother in law just not that kind of mood or keep the flipping through the book doesn't say anything [noise]\nImagine what she must have been feeling seeing that photo suddenly dislike for ...\nYeah crazy hasn't she is must I think should be really good uh poker [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo ... says nothing goes home later that night she tells her daughter this was the one this was the man who might have been she explained that the reason they hadn't married\nWas because her father highlands grandfather\nHad chosen a different has been for a man who became hound father\nAll of them ended up living in the U.S that they quickly lost touch Steven didn't find out about any of this until a couple of days later\nThat's why the hell and you know cause that says ah actually they tell you and she tells me and I was I was floored by it um and you know together will be called my mom and you know she put on a good face on it she but she was you know she was pretty shocked\nDid she know that there had been this other woman that your father had in love as the thing\nMy dad told her years and years ago you know there was this other woman that I that I that I Would love without ... you know long before I met you but mom was like look you look past I have a pass fail a past who cares um of course you know never thinking that she was going to share grandchildren with that woman\nIt was like look you look past the past ... asked who cares um of course you know never thinking that she was going to share grandchildren with that one that I mean she later admitted to me that if she had known this from the very beginning she would have not supported Elena me I'm really you know it was just been like look\nBeing with the daughter of this ... of the other woman your dad loved I mean it would [noise] can you find someone else [laughter] [noise]\n\nHow do you take this coincidence ... did it come to mean anything to you or to ... [noise]\nYeah there's something about it the fact that you know I didn't have the time with my dad that I Wish I had had yeah\nAnd then suddenly to kind of have him be kind of an active part of my life again to think that uh I can talk to my mother in law and hear what he was like in his twenties something that my mom doesn't even know\nAnd you know it might actually held his father is a strong believer in the idea that somehow my dad is somehow is behind all this and that somehow you know he's kind of help make all this happened [noise]\n\n\nAt the time this next story takes place a guy named ... was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington heights he just started dating a woman named Esther they've been out maybe eight times\nAnd I thought maybe it was time to\nGet exclusive or become boyfriend girlfriend or whatever it was and it was about to go out to lunch and I was thinking about asking or on a friday date today and I'm set up\nAnd I went out to lunch or stopped at the store prior to hitting the deli that I normally hit\nAnd uh I got some chain went to the deli order my sandwich was six bucks or something like that I pulled out five for my wallet and I pulled out a couple of bucks change that I had gotten from a store handed the clerk one of the ones uh and then I looked at it and I I pulled it back\nWritten on the dollar and pencil was I asked her\nAnd I thought oh that's weird you know I'm thinking about asking her to go study and I get those dollars as as drones bizarre\nSo stuck in my pocket you know charcoal and went to the store I got one of those voting frames and little piece of gold will may and I stopped a dollar and the frame so it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold whereas if you know you're going to go in a church in Italy and they had a fragment from a robust some saying or something like that and I call it the ...\nSo it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold whereas if you know you're going to go on a church in Italy and they had a fragment from a robust some saying or something like that and I call it the immaculate dollar of Arlington heights\n\n\nAnd so I'm On the friday I asked her out and she was you know all excited and we're all getting that I I had one more thing for you and I gave her this frame with US dollar in it\nI I start ... and he's like\nIt's a dollar with your ... and he's he's all like beside himself and I just look at 'em like\nShe a ton of fraud or brow a little bit and look concerned and ah I said you know is there a some sort of problem\nI I was speechless for the first time ever\nBut I said you know remind me to tell you something later ...\n...\n... okay you know we I I let it go and uh we you know where we had a really should've got engaged got married a couple of years later\nWe were um unpacking at a new apartment that we had an and I have a life on the the frame with the dollar in it and I stuck it up on the dresser and she came in the room I said hey I'm never told me about this hour what's the deal with that she said well\nWhen I was Eighteen\nYou know I was a cashier working in a a copy shop in downtown Chicago and I was dating someone and I just wasn't happy with him and I just thought you know how do people know who the right person that they're meant to be with\nDo they how do they know who that is I think you know and I'm not going to worry about that I'm just going to put my name on the dollar bill and the guy that gets US dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him and I'm like well you can't just right on your name I Want actually I think it was more like maybe ten or twelve\nAnd so this dollar bill that you gave\nI Believe is the same dollar bill that I wrote my name on and I knew that we were going to be married to date you gave me the style or but\nIt was pretty crazy and then you make me sound the story again he asked me like five or six times and it's just the details on changes the same story like he couldn't I think he was a little bit beside himself the fat actually happened and that I didn't tell [noise]\nYou know I I I don't know how I found the ...\nThen and that I didn't tell [noise]\nYou know I I I don't know how I found the will to not say anything Tom but I just remember like do I donate to I don't do it you know what do I do\nI don't watch freaked this guy out and be like why this is already talking about Mary just wait why forget it [noise]\nYou know I don't read too much into almost anything so I just got to move forward and then after she told me\nI think I went through all the the normal stages of whatever and I just but what does this mean for us are we going to invent a time machine or our kids going to bring world peace or like well what's the point some sort of bigger\nThing that we're not seeing here [noise]\nNow just sits in that very same frame of butter\nOr dresser and I look at it every day that I wake up\nSometimes I reminder that we have it [noise]\nOne she's upset at me or angry\nIt's never been a question in my mind like you know what I'm going to kick this kind of the curve\nBut but I Do believe it's because of his dollar that I feel that type to um I mean obviously I Love him but I think that if it ever did cross my mind I'd be like but we\nI this is my soul mate I Can't just walk out on him\nYou know we don't we don't even wear wedding bands I'm like why just and I'm stuck with you\nYou got the dollar bill [laughter]\nI guess you could also you know put it back out into the register and it'd be like look I'm catching them than [laughter]\nI think it's got to go to somebody else you could do that [noise]\nPaul and Esther ... had been married for Nineteen years\nAgo\nThree brother can you spare a dime [noise]\nThe story comes from Ryan rows are in Los Angeles\nIt happened when I was in college um I was actually pledging a fraternity and I ran into some of the like the seniors and I'm On campus and they were laughing about something\nAnd so one of 'em tells me the story that had happened to him that day supposedly where he gets in the shower and about five ten minutes into a shower he hears a team\nAnd getting a van and they take off\nSo Japanese friends do precisely what you don't want them to do if this were an after school special this is the point where you're yelling at the TV saying don't do it stay inside but they decide they have to find out what the strange men in the van have deposited at the top of the hill so they run up there\nWe get to the top and we kind of look around and then we see that kind of on one side of it there's just this manhole cover like a circular man will cover like you'd see anywhere\nComing from one of the edges of manhole cover it in place is\nUm long brown hair human hair long\nBrown human hair\nThey're teenagers they're stoned their freaked out\nThey have to tell an adult about what they've seen\nA police car happened to drive by their flag it down and the officer tells them to get in the back\nIt became clear that she was really concerned because she'd been said\nYeah there's been a girl and the thing\nOn the west side of town for the last couple of days so my\nParents are down like our hearts just sort of drop\nAnd you had known that hadn't been on the news or something like we had no idea [noise]\nSo we we just kind of got scared at that point\nCan I can I have you ever second is this going to get funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't have any I mean do you okay don't tell me\nI'm so\nThe second is this going to get funny or is this a horrifying story we actually don't have any don't how many do you okay don't tell me\nI'm so\nShe called another officer and the other officer comes there's a couple cars\nAnd they both get out and tell us to get out and they say okay wait at the bottom [noise]\nOverweight and they go walking into [noise] and it's dark so we can't really\nEven thought well but we can see them well enough and we don't really want to watch what's going on because we see them\nAnd I'm trying to look but of course I'm working [noise]\nPulled up the human figure out of the whole oh my God\nAnd then she says it's a man of ...\n\nI don't know what my friends with him but I was sitting there thinking\nHow does this story and okay in a\nUnless you say is the mayor [laughter]\nJeff goes to school on Monday tells his story in physics class\nAnd the kid next to him says that was us\nWe went around stealing holiday decorations and we had to get rid of them so we stopped them under the manhole cover\nThe mannequin by the way had been the Virgin Mary and someone's nativity scene\nI think the real coincidence is that it's like our close friends that\nCaused this to happen until they were good friends ears\nRight All right no Jeff turns out that is not the real coincidence of the story liberties or Brian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening and he interrupted us to tell us we both missed the point\nIs just pointed out that I miss\nYou and I are both of my own story yeah submitted it to their to incidents of thing\nTo the main coincidences there's a girl missing at the same time\nHave five words for you Jeff ...\nNo coincidence no story\nHere's a definition of coincidence that seems right to me a coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events perceived as meaningfully related with no apparent causal connection if that middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because when events line up just so\nWith no apparent causal connection if that middle part meaningfully related that people seem to get stuck on because one of ... line up just so\nYou can't help it you can't help but wonder if there's a message in that\nIn that way coincidences are kind of like short cuts to very big questions about fate about God even to people who don't believe in either one\nThe notion that somewhere out there someone or something is paying attention to your life that there might be a plan Concord drew coincidences that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time when she was Nineteen she's listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album\nI was listening to the song that old black magic and at the end of the song Ella chosen a line that old black magic that Billy Daniels got me in and I've heard her say that line on that album dozens of times before and wondered ... Daniel [noise]\nBut on this particular day for some reason I felt inspired to go out to the delivery room and ask my dad is really Daniels once and he explained it\nIn the forties the bill Daniels head son ... magic in a way that made it his song and he was referred to as Mr Black magic I guess back in the forties and it was a big deal at the time and\nI asked my dad had you met him you know did you ever know Billie Daniels and he said that but again you know he's probably dead now and just\nLiterally at that moment the phone rang\nJoy to the phones and this playful gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley\nAnd I said who's who's calling\n\nMeasure\nLast September um I was living in New Mexico and I had woken up in jail for like the last time\nThis is at a ... percent when this happened she was Twenty years old on drugs hanging out with street kids\nHer mom offered to buy or a bus ticket to Washington state to go to rehab at a said yes she took her dog and got on the bus in Los Angeles there was a stopover at the ... and this guy comes up to her while she's waiting in line to get food to two dollars just enough for some French fries the guy starts asking her questions about her dog\nAnd he started asking them questions like what do you do on where you're going to ask me are you from Alaska and I'm like oh yeah yeah\nWhat do you do on where you're going to and then he asked me are you from Alaska and I'm like uh yeah I Am actually\nAnd then he asked me if your mom named Meg and I was like um mhm yeah she is and you're like oh well on crafts I'm your father like ten years ago and I'm like oh holy\nAnd it had only seen her father that one time briefly and she was eleven\nAnd he pulled out a big wad of money and like he paid and my food and then they have they forty bucks and it's like don't than ever gave enough and and walked away\n... [laughter] I'm like shocked by the story and he didn't that was it you didn't see him again he didn't know [noise]\n\n'cause you can tell you how bad the did you expect something were to happen like did you think no I really just not going to go\nTo like sit down and eat together and I was going to lay out my whole life story for him then again it's going to play in his life where where are you and I was kind of looking forward to that but that didn't happen not fair to say I want to study it safe for longer because ...\nThat's the scenery twice and I I still can't remember what it looks like do you regret\nNot not pursuing him in some way yeah\nAbsolutely in a moment I was just out you know so I just really couldn't comprehend whether\n... on the bus and I was kind of just like why didn't I read after him and I've spent my whole life wondering how this man you know the chance to talk to him is that right in front of my age [noise] I didn't really understand that at the time and I like oh I'm\nA millionaire Garcia Sarnoff also hadn't seen his father and many years since he was seven or eight years old he lived in California but he was visiting a national park in Mexico with his mother when he was Eighteen and they have to the top of the pyramid there the whole place was sort of off the beaten track\nHer walking walking along the ... people back to front of us and my mom said oh my God\nWalk and walk along there are people who front of us and my mom said oh my God ... and then she turned to me and that's that's your father um that's your dad and I was\nAlso coincidentally it was Father's Day\nI I ended up sort of embarrassing like breaking down crying on that pyramid I was really emotional moment for me my father definitely you know absent meant a lot\nAnd we said yeah we're going to stay in contact and after they buy they left she came running back up the hill about twenty minutes later and parenting and he said really on on just want to say I'm Sorry I didn't stay in touch and\nAnd that I Love you turned and went back down on them ...\nAnd ... story goes away at a wishes hers had gone after rocky few years he and his father did get to know each other and each other's families I mean I don't know how to sun out a grandfather ... million his father had left him when he was a baby but when his father died some years ago a millionaire was there at the hospital\nThat had a real relationship and that never would have happened a million of said if you hadn't seen him that day at the paramount\nWalking down the pyramid I was talking to myself and I was saying that this is why he's advertising forget don't drink and you know [laughter]", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "03"}
