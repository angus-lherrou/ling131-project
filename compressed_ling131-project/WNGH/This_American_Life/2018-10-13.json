B. radio and Eighteen stations service of Georgia Public broadcasting of mixed it's this American Life and at one o'clock in the snap judgment\nOn the next how I built this we need a guy who stopped at nothing to eat yogurt company ... business but I did what any self respecting entrepreneurs does I called my mother and I borrowed thirty thousand dollars from\nThe planet many ... to ...\nHour of economic and innovation I'm Planet Money and how I built\nPlanet Money and how I built this today and for on GB\n[noise]\nNinety seven point seven FM double your G. P. B. S. W. A. G. P. H. D. room for the Georgia Public broadcasting radio network [noise]\n\nIt's a school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into their building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they were running the first drill in the school building with a gun pressure on the boxes\n\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district him or Ohio there's that his record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nIt eight people on this team only two teachers how to avoid the retro guidance counselor to custodians the treatment is traders who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team loses power corrupts and doing this Lisa so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise]\nI saw the ride a bunch of drought [noise] and then all of them the goal was to run to the air safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to pay for this one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks city fire during these drills [noise] so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble\nHere to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint\nAnd it's a little tricky\nYou had to put your finger on the center of\nAnd it's a little tricky\nNo no there's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shoes [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John\nRunning from his office starts by the cafeteria\nHe's got a gun he's rambling ... bass he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking she told me that every few seconds\nOne of these shootings and other kid can kill\nEnough of this way\n...\n[noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway\nAnd it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically wonderful goes into lockdown so he and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one [noise]\nHe's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nReal material\n[noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise]\nThat's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the responses\nWasn't great that\nWasn't going to hurt her first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nSo controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to fight\nI talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school\nHe says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one they came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force mhm so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for helped I don't know that I was necessarily sold at this\nIn an area that doesn't even have it sounds ... got in the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away\nYou worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time he should've gone that's pretty scary it was scary to me [noise]\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around\nHow close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target ... can mess\nI Can't miss\nBecause if I miss\nThere's a possibility if somebody else getting her\nAnd I can't let that happen\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nUs doing it in my school\nOf course she might have to she wanted us to [noise] and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed but\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\n[noise]\nThese shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do\nLike the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting\nKnowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish\nIf she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything\nBack when our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can\nLike one of our show today we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who invented something that actually seems to work and help\nFrom WBEZ in Chicago it's this American Life America ...\n\n... like one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust among before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared\nWords I mean they knew what to\nEven still even with that we\nDid the training they received to save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi in winter park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWant you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for fun\nIf you're doing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every ... this is what a code black it this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid might have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids [noise] new procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she plans to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors the face of freshmen building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshmen building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's\nThere they're not that there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she still enter doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the clawed it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nTo give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and yes it was [laughter]\nYes it was in a lab and\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [noise] [noise]\n... in her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway [laughter] [noise] the group is small enough to fitness applied call that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight she'd been taught and moved there\nIn the closet it was hot and dark except students faces led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the first rebuilding she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the cause it without having a light on and when\nI heard the door open and put it sounded like he was open with the key um and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police adviser said this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\n[noise]\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that in training\nSlowly at the handle and I opened it really is\nUnless your first time I set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhat they're told me that actually it was one of five people you know who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy hold her door open until she was like locked eyes with [laughter] you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands in polls that closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nBases that teacher who's our most grade is she survived and Scott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way what\n\nIt was very little evidence about whether school shooting trails of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we can talk about them are still statistically rare anomalous ... has been in a rare situation the one that's hard to study\nAnd they both told me that having a playbook for what to do helped and\nNow I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and\nNow I'm of assault to a closet\nBut he also both had ideas coming out of the\nWays they could have been better prepared and\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom\nAnd training on how to treat bullet wounds with it\nDoes actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what the fact of and these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things\nPercy and as a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best\nCheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done but she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas\nLike paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso ... all the codes their colors and meanings the consultants I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAnd all I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat ... active shooter means I have to do that [noise]\nVersus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise] keeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet [noise] but the idea\nThat this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting [noise] sometimes you stay in your room or sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort\nBasically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nTold her about actually occurs how sheets dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of students from ever it was a\nBreak from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids\nThe problem with this and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly\nHappened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricade in your door\nBasically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked in barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull the kids in her room from the hallway\nTo on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in oh\nFewer kids would admitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school when I\nWhen I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say not great\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nStudents did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all they'd have been better off without it\nAnd the researchers who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids\nDon't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nOh God I'm so sorry we're we're ...\nYeah it's OK honey you're doing it now\nOkay his name is ... present ski he graduated last year there across to set up for three people he knew well\nOne of them was a teacher named ms Perkins we really loved he said she always tried to be strict with him looking ever keep 'em that fought for very long\nChance breeze taken nice deep\nTake a nice ...\nOK\nAfter a few minutes he's caught his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop\nSo you want to take action somehow\nAfter a few minutes he's caught his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop\nSo he wants to take action somehow\nAnd then had suddenly switches gears start feeling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know before I was going on in this world that can get a ... strip oysters doors are so able to do\nAnd now he plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year I'm somewhere safe houses are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and factories like bump stocks personally by\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control about he queues of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life in your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broken up\nI reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment\nThat conspiracy theorists there's truth or ... or ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting it can get dangerous for after that Philips is on gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats that had to get\nThe FBI involved the demand was threatening him ended up in jail to hoaxes or one of the things the Philips has worn parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nI'm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again\nCancer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home\nReliving their worst moment over and over again\nDancer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us\nThis was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado\nHour after the movie started to find called Sandy from the theater the minute\nI picked up the phone there was [noise]\nScreening just [noise]\nArnold screaming in the background\nPanic and she said I'm there's been a shooting\nWhat is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster\nAnd I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nAllies and Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so loud it was so horrific and something I never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting Sandy Hook or twenty first graders and six educators died days later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted this loves us\nReaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they need at least said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after ... died\nThat when they arrive at a community center in Newtown\nAnd he says they felt nervous uncomfortable\nMaybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces [noise]\nThey said that is what we look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise]\nAnd we walked in the room and I saw their faces [noise]\nHe said that's what we look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other and they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized\nThat's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality\nLooking back Sandy said that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nBut the filters said there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from whatever they're they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents have lost kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo filter now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the fields as to what's become their life work they could see the need their new experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other bunny and Sandy has set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things\nEverything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money to get your child's body home if you live out of state\nHowever this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal light mon brothers should they should [laughter] same as you were ...\nYou know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person I never will be the shooters were obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says and a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nWe believe are closest to disappear\nWhich makes us informal support groups even more crucial\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son and the shooting at Parkland Monica in that store at\nOr something was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team was it\nThen the shooting at Parkland Monica in that store at\nOr something was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis on a twin scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid who collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops\nBut said they'd just reached a point where they're becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nToday the shooting ... phone\nCalls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard neck was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer was giving him a ride home and then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who mash next description [noise] by that evening the door it's still hadn't heard directly from Nick\nThey went to an area that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in and they calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we have to find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd um at two o'clock in the morning they see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from their dreams\nAnd their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like ... we couldn't even find your son and you know and I thought that he was somewhere else and have to keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to her house\nAnd then they told us the news\nThat he was gone he was shot and he was never brought to the hospital it'll just like a nightmare\nBody was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at his injuries
