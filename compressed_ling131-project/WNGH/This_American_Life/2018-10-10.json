P. B.\nRemember in the news was boring politics is boring that happen right\nWing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it I don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively reading\nAbout judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years where\nRed America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions from\nTo me oh this one feels the worst oh I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting and [noise] and then since at hearing we've had this week of waiting and the FBI report\nWhich held us all for a week in that same state agitation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one [noise] there are people who haven't picked aside [noise]\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today and I shall we have somebody\nThat situation and our first act [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake\nAnd it does not seem fun for them today and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our\nFirst act [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake or second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise]\nNo real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nAll those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable with all the b._b._c. Chicago it's this American Life America stay with us [noise]\n[noise]\nOne judge [noise]\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face to drag his decisions down to the wire over and over\nUsed undecided didn't seem like a new one cabin up there was a yes it was like wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than he was a guest again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill [noise] she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet of hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator\nAnd tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at sleek peering out from the elevator [noise]\nHe just stood me up for an interview [noise]\nJust like these can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune in this case though I think he was miserable\nHe just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get the elevator to get the vote now he was stuck you\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nWhat they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind mirror words I have no reverberated around this country flicking declared that he will be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination was confronted by a mob of screening protests\nIn their words have now reverberated around this country flick it declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination was confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled ... was one of the two women and that confrontation play good morning good morning\nWhen that elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't and I'm reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days\nLots of people loved this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of\nThese last two weeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nIn the morning to remind also\nWe talked about it\nIt was the thing is just not the thing that convinced him as well protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator\nOn the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham before but women jumped on the elevator with a war hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand borrowing calling out you believe women Senator Flake out he's only\nFor women we thank you what do you have to pay something you said a winning right now and the survivors\nBecause it affects you and people like\nIt's like making fun of themselves\nIt affects you and people like\nLike making fun of themselves\nWe've talked about before\nLike slapped him in his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nYou know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the morning he sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that and here we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty\nGoing out of this room today and go and just have a little humility on that front so\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThan eight after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found cabin are credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him they thought it might be\nHis staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything\nAny decision on a boat\nA debate for staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that does the raw [noise]\nIt was that was already raw [noise]\nAnd then it happens just like he predicted\nAfter seven days of being treated as a Democrat or at least a Republican defector fleet comes home\nTo the GOP on Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for\nOn friday week announced his decision he's a yes on cap and on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nYou know look Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said it was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car\nPeople are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI report\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people [laughter] stuff [laughter] [noise] chocolate chip early you know [noise]\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no aisle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take\nIt didn't rain down there is No Child stand in the middle of the court a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kinda don't ever take sides with anyone against the family [noise]\n\nVery chase ... program that turn out of this recording that we found of Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has that changed since he went through\nWell I like my own\nYou know remember the [noise]\nThe Senate is a political body and they have to act in a political way\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nUs how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nUh to recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd the integrity\nTo do\nWhat you should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament\nThink the church should be broadly read\nMy self was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you have to be careful about\nSo so so so that so that so the Senate or as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people asked embed escape it cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way it was funny he was a good talker and explained his job how it works\nUm just the nine of us\nIt's funny he's a good talker and explained his job how it works\nUm just the nine of us\nOr we begin with or seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nAnd if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision\nOr the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just\nReverse or from it's a question that the rationale\nThan let's say five to four\nFive in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of off\nWe realize one of us will have to write an opinion\nThat commands the allegiance\nAn opinion that explains\nThe principles of war the principles of the constitution\nThe controls a result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case\nWe draw down on a capital of trust and we make a withdrawal on the trust in the public has in our institution [noise]\nAnd it is our job always to replenish that trust\nBy hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nAnd quiet discussion\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nMy story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few men\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both it was it nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to cheer me for a few minutes ago I said well do you have any questions\nAnd ah what attorney raises Hanna says\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well\nI'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the parts of course I have to read them all\nThey're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre worn out for cases sometimes to opera cases [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but it sounded kind of what\nIntellectually pretentious thirty are here to some\nEastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I'd lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs alive the rule like that when I write those briefs I said oh it wants to expect preventive just expect\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack\nClub the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up a total and complete amateur\nHas to decide to death sentence\nPrevious experience in these matters\nWatching law

that whatever program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us in the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer\nUp until the article was published\nThat was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who read the article [noise]\nFearing his co workers might over here he took the call outside behind his office building [noise]\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI Fox incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone\nWho choose life imprisonment when in fact all I had to do was declines of death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nAfter the article was published something else\nAfter the article was published something else happened something span never expected or wanted\nAll stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness forgiven me\nIf I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness of Trump's so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nPretend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that\nAnd like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message and how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nAlready did began reply but I didn't have the courage to finish her son to\nSort of you know there's so much pain in there and [noise]\nUm [noise] feel like a really read things up [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email and execution date was at\nThe state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith carry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to carry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of is deet\nBased on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email\nBut he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want [noise]\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nNot doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my ... for not trying [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or\nEven the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you ... object will remain and our intelligence acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge\nAnd so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would reads and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email\nThank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nChills or forward originally email just fed the once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about\nWhat I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks banned for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that span consumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nI\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all or some\nSome of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah okay ...\nLives in Fort Worth Texas that sort of the two of us to meet the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering the food that she can't ... you want to have the coffee or tea Maryland is told in stately with smiling eyes so she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black\nYou want the coffee or tea\nMaryland is told in state linked with smiling eyes so she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life of the party I mean I was a jokester all makes you you have Marilyn jak because she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go\nDo it so since the trial in Maryland doesn't feel like the same person because every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away why on the things that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our\nVows to cause the bottom of that and that\nWas a very hard for me [laughter]\nIt's like they wanted everything to be okay\nThat much how\nAnd I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him when working with her son's lawyers to change your sentence to life in prison\nDolls appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy update which affected the hospitality jobs she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and\nI felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job barely then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nThat I'm ...\nI'm In in\nTen years after the trial and every one of your friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland red spends article and she saw him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nThey actually gay to thin\nThe death penalty [noise]\nI thought I had literally die at\nThey didn't even register\nBecause I'm just like you\nThought I had literally die\nThey didn't even register\nBecause I'm just like you\nAnd what just happened what have they done they know the whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing 'em\nI wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he had\nAnd I want people to know you know everybody has their own that if you involved in a heinous crime like that the true a monster but he wasn't a monster\nYou know okay so she's going to come up in Maryland and I had been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for us\nI think things than\nThan than as the ... and bad yeah\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before he did\nBut before we get a chance to practice their fans spanned is at the door [noise]\nHi Stan I'm Jonathan it's very nice things than errands here now\nSpend\nA lot of men lingers in the door the hotel room sit down to have a seat over there a he's a spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks
