[noise]\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nYeah so ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far is using this thing called the transit method when the uh\nOr yeah or there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well\nIn addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet and so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it as it orbits the star and so\nSometimes that planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this like some of them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on the planet that uh that uh we're attributing to the moon\n[laughter] hey says no and that's the point I Want to pick up on because we came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right why did they say out\nLoud so it's an extraordinary claim and as the famous thing goes extraordinarily playing is ah one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job or trying to rule out other possible explanations for this signal\nA question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planet in the system that's that's pulling on this planet and making and walk around\nA those are all plausible explanation ... uh but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm\nIt was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you're right very hard to get so you must have other people might want to know about\nMeasure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits it with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim a so we really thought at that time we\nIRS we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration event or we observed this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope or from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitched together multiple datasets from multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that uh that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the once the Hubble is is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it should be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope ... a better for you guys were looking an exoplanet it's gonna be hell why yeah if it had been spectacular\nInstrument it's a very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as humble orbits the earth\nOr when we perform this observation you know you can imagine ... staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit ... takes Ninety six minutes or so to go around so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out\nA James jaded just he won't have that problem\nAnd like I said the mirror is going to be really spectacular so uh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly or the time so we're going to have to\nA very good case [noise] you know their downs officer but now there isn't\nAn eye on the ... the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time it gets built a highway or something else I think some law well we should have made it twice as big we've whatever and I'm sure yeah you\nSo there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to well that we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... ... yeah that's a\nUh I I don't know who's working on a bed and it's a ultraviolet and a red and optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh they they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instrument stadium Estee will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it's still a\nFamous for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instruments stadium Estee will definitely be an improvement on Hubble but you know Hubble is over twenty five years old now and it still a top of the top of the line instrument to use it nearly amazing\nIt is All right so if this is a strange ... planet situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd ah you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems\nWe are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here happened in a billion hundred billion mother places are across the Milky Way or it's this very uncommon chain of events that that led to us here\nSmart TV so you've got the TV you've got the speakers you got the ... you have everything you need for a really great set up but you don't even have the opportunity to get this if we don't hear from you right now at eight hundred to two to four seven eight or go to a G.

[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we're talking with author Deborah Blum about how food safety protections came to be the topic of her new book\nProportions squad one camera single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five I'm let's turn out the clock back\nTo that time period ... or you have an entire chapter on ... [laughter]\nI was so and I did I ... while you're devoted to what I read it I Know why or why devote the tell our listeners an entire chapter I catch up [noise]\nSo this is it gets up it's just an amazing story at this point for a couple of reasons one is we have this very twenty first idea scrawny for a century idea of catch up which is you know of a sick tomato based kind of a but\nIn the nineteenth again at tended to be a kind of thin nasty\nA sauce with a lot of vegetable ways to end that people would put pumpkin ... people would put tomatoes that they might be riding they would die them sometimes what's called Tara dies and then because of the whole mess of it\nTended to kind of be rotten anyway they dumped preserve it as in a like sodium ... which is actually still with us today and so this ... this kind of battle ground of food safety just as meat did was Upton Sinclair\nAnd in this case I really love the story because\nIt makes the point that you know not every business is evil and a Henry J lines of a law Heinz\nFood manufacturing company took it upon himself to get preservatives out of his ... his products the reinvented catch up so the catch up we know today was really created by Heinz and he did it so there was a lot of tomato and I said\nThat kept the bacterial count down and then he really went to war a mean this was a battle between business and advocates and and ... business friendly government\nAnd Heinz ... though he was a big believer in profit really pushed for safer products and actually sent to his ah some of the people who work with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety the things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid\nWork with them to meet with Roosevelt and say you have got to regulate food safety the things that we make are not being trusted because consumers are afraid of food there were afraid of meat they're afraid of preservatives I Want you to do something and catch up kinda catches all of that\nPlus you know there was major combat over the preservatives and gets her and that was pretty fascinating\n[laughter] I'm not supposed to talk about a Harvey Washington where I was a little bit more than ... the focus of your book in the ... um [noise]\nHe actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out yes food safety ever tell us about that because what was one of the ... you have to ... it was amazing [noise] it's just\nCrazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think if you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really since for about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know\nAt completely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animal safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things in the human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees are mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerous Lee and the deal was\nThey wouldn't eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time had to be adding capsules\nOf the compound that he was testing at various doses from a very low to very high\nAnd so during the poison quote squad experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food\nHe looked at ... which is a cleaning product he looked at salad silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname is the poisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat drives a conversation right for thirty something years but changes the conversation on our way we think about food safety\nSo did he actually more and more of their laws created because of his\nCrusade where the Congress actually put teeth and ... and things like that [noise]\nUm so after you know he's like battling always stymied by eventually in Nineteen oh six to laws passed then one was the meat inspection act and that was a direct result of Upton Sinclair as the jungle and the ... the horrors\nAnd then about a week later the food and drug active Nineteen oh six passed a somewhat carried by that kind of tidal wave of fury that brought us the meat inspection act\nAnd that was an and I we've forgotten the ... but that was the first great consumer protection low ever passed by the federal government\nAnd so it was the moment in which we all agree as a society that the government's job is in part to protect the average citizen from harm\nAnd to stand up in that way if you ask why early he would say\nOkay that was a star but the law was immediately weekend by business interactions which it was to the point that he he ended up extremely frustrated I don't think he ever fully gave himself credit for what he accomplished\nBut and eventually that law led to a law in the Nineteen thirties that created the modern FDA so a lot of people still call him the father of the FDA even though he died before it was created", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "05"}
