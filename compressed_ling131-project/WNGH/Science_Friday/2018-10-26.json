I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really steep and all that waste maturity when did you think\nAbout a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you could really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly into space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really a fun way to have it moving [laughter] except\nFor throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was part of his engineering mindset here's an here's a clip\nOf ... ...\n... what we want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything [noise]\nI had a choice they take more\nI think that's a real quote\nYou ... you know right I did I did I met him once I'm\nAt a conference so I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way up by ... I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie I think this is a a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak the engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drunks and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we do is communicated really affected me was he as reserved as you went as you knew him and well I didn't really I don't think I knew that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about a\nUm you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues and ask for an office so you know I think it's a bit of both you was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out [laughter]\nOf both you was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out\n[laughter] you didn't get that impression too much\nIn the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life that requires concentration and diligence\nIn as your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer [noise]\nI I think ... engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies you see that there's fund engineers there was a very serious one they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair trial because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult called the scenes of space flight where they had the Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying or does you'd was that realistic Pew [noise]\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people are feeling you have this ... floating in feeling but especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room\nThat you were really crammed in there the cockpit is right and your faith the control panel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal ... all the switches engages are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride that pill can be a very bumpy so that was certainly true\nThat is going to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nOh hi Hi Saturday I think I got disconnected there for a moment um yeah I was saying it just sends you added the bench during the program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the gym my program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans that space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for that call you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the your bringing the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seed you know to go landing on the ...\nI think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of made it much more visible and they ask for an office there are I mean there were other candidates for the job\nBut for sure the gym and I ate experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous mission and I was just looking at all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race a kind of success\nAll life magazines from that month and it was widely reported at the time as a kind of really a kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race a kind of successful failure in that sense but a a a fantastic moments captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very hard to say I'm a big emotional punch of the story was and Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old and then the last so the fellow astronauts on the lead up to Apollo you know ... follow one whatever\nHow do you think these humans just lost his shaped history has has played out ah\n[noise] well I you know I mean these things or if I I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses because they

Carroll Janice and um you know there are very few African Americans and space exploration very few went in\nAnd he was the first African American woman to go into space exploration and not only that she just seems like a like a really cool purse to hang out with them and she's done dancing and acting\nWith on Star Trek and she graduated high school at sixteen and um you know insurance that they're inspired by the civil rights movement I just feel like he's just all around up really multifaceted fascinating person killed in a movie it out and I'd love to because he was arrested the something about her you're not very much\nIn agreement oh yeah I may Johnson is is very cool I've I've met her a few times and it's just always a treat to talk to her about a night can you tell us a little bit about her history and um I I think pretty much what the college that is what I Know of her as a she's just like like a really\nInteresting life filled with a lot of different things from science to the arts and leisure [noise]\nOn age evidently yeah there are certainly a lot of a background um she flew wanting to shuttle flights early ones for women and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell her\nI said yep so movie I think there would be amazing stories or um\nIt flew wanting to shuttle flights early wants for women and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell her\nI said yep suddenly I think there would be amazing stories or um you know for life is amazing than it is a treat from a tweet from apple says how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly\nFor perhaps what would happen would have happened if they did for\nSound like an interesting topic there are all these behind the scenes stories right\nYeah there are I mean I think um [noise] it that's the mystery that Thirteen rate I so I I they're I Believe was a ... some kind of Netflix theories about about that and also some kind of documentary series that was all regard as\nWell um [noise] and all the people who were in control room and all the other places and you know [noise] all kinds of all kinds of stories um interesting ah this this is a movie um about heroes of astronaut certainly fifty years ago\nAnd it will be fifty years since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and we also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff wires Hollywood still talking about things that happened fifty years ago when so much has happened since what do you think [noise]\nYeah I mean that's a good question I I think\nPart of it is that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big staff that human exploration has has done in the last\nFifty years I mean that that shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting an incredible like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that\nUh and that that like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get there do\nYou know that's when I when we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and they're mad at other places\nAnd you know what we also hear about any stories of any other countries in his basement mhm there's so many other asked if there are so many countries up there right now\nI mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russian sort of thing that will be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're [noise] Boulder travails and difficulties and\nStarted like um there's many ways to enter into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you\nBill ... and [noise] just based on like um there's many waist and then enter into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those are sort of maybe imagining a kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think\nMaybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back rules with imagining the future is your what are they talking about NASA these days who found [noise]\nAh so what what are big project is actually trying to get back to the moon so that uh the Ryan at the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so\nYou know really I think once we can start flying those flights are there will be a whole nother a crop of uh stories to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering at how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell what it takes to actually get\nTo the flight ... for the astronaut the fly on it mhm [laughter] banned in Mesa, Arizona welcome to science friday\n... thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I I Would think it'd be interesting to make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop a launching a and fortunately that did not happen\nUm and it in the affected them in ways that many people did though of course it affects it killed the crew but oh\nI think that many of the of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a plan to make a movie about the challenger mission [noise] um but focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made a the the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and uh [noise]\nI'm fine and I'm sure it will be crucial to understanding the accident\nYou knew you mentioned the Orion mission at once they get back to the moon is is it going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from Powell\nIn order to know uh getting to the moon is\nToday that was in the Nineteen sixties I mean we know a little bit more and we have an experience space of one to draw from a but actually going to the new into the mission is going to be justice risky its just\nSix days I mean we know a little bit more we have an experience space of one draw from a but actually going to the moon to the mission is going to be justice risky it's just it's hard to do um the amount of a prop we name when Neal said he wished for more ... I Wish for more prop every day as well\nUm so it's not any easier getting to the moon and it is risky and the second time around\nI remember after the ... the Apollo missions were cancelled there were three rockets leftover we only went to Seventeen is supposed to be twenty I remember going to Houston and seeing them lying on their side one lying inside is a home\nFor nesting birds and everyone thought there was anything as sad as seeing as Saturn five being home for you know it's nice to birds out of place in this flu is the most recently we if in a building now and it's been restored\nI Know that has been couldn't we just turn that's put back in the family building and loan\nBut are they the avionics are quite out of date at this point I don't control it anymore [laughter]\nWhen what's the schedule for that and do we have enough money and is it going to be going\nSo we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of the last ah and really the second launch of a Ryan we launched in ... for the first flight of her eye on 'em and that'll be an untruth flight we are going around the moon or to a different retrograde orbits literally been go way past and they went about Seventy thousand kilometers on the far side\nAnd that will be a long mission just really a shakedown all of the vehicle systems on ... and the Ryan before we put crew out in the next flight we were in progress we have enough money um and it's just a challenge getting their back to the future", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "26"}
