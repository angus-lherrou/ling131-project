Jarvis\nHarvest transfer from I'm here in California I Would like to see on the sidewalk ... slightly larger than what they are a little bit longer there but yeah and of course she than the ones you see on the sidewalk and why why are you interested in the\nCities and the blacks are the true however ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between ... still a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they call their friends to food sales and everything I brought here as saying cast ... to flip it over I was on its head also\nWould hang just like that that's a cast of an answer is yes it was like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly faster players from Home Depot how far does that go down as just the whole life I Know that's just the top part\nAbout six eight inches long it looks just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is the type of metal said when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to Iran and its own break like the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to ... and then my mentor I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how they can go\nTo our house there's so much focus on queen bumble bee wonder about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nThe drones so that they're the drones don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my life\nSo the ... the drones don't do too much for the call any itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because\nThey have this part of their life or they're living on their own and we've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's important to point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this and one of those really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or for what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nWell for the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other sort of trajectory\nUm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point\nUh but we think that there are probably also factors in order to just like there are and honeybees and bumblebees and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your own and flip star right over there on the rights are just go ahead please my um my\nMom is allergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to like help heal her when she gets styles\nThat is a great question I'm allergic to bees to back\nThat up first or do you work with ... and you're allergic\nSo I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies [noise] um that's a really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were somebody being me to\nUm does a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I bet there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the victim and the B interact\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question but no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen Howard their lives different from something like a honeybee\nThere's a lot of ... and so there's different types of ... and um there's some similarities\nHi how are they are large different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of ... and so there's different types of sociology and um there's some similarities and differences and first of all many of them live underground raise bees will and put their hives inside of fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example those honeybees in some species advance will relocate from one site to another is so honeybees will\nGo and look for a new nest site and kind of the way the shape of the entrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other and we'll also there's a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is that again have small entrances and dark places so there's some similarities in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have am colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands in even up to ... million so at least cutter\nSupport for G.

California [noise]\nHow did\nYou sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard but I Am not the only one I can see from the audience said his takes about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great\nFewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... but he's our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules\nCould there be jeans at work my next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep and how well we recover from last week\nAnd he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back took a team of Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\n\nRight you need to get seven hours of sleep at night that's what the usual requirement is yes\nFor um the majority of long term studies that have looked have found that if you get significantly less will significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night van that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah 'cause I get like six if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that don't know how can I add in all honesty\nI'm In the six hour crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually\nWe do know is bad if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first star where we can sort of short term so many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe up with the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow\nThe short term so many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just may be out for the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things\nYou may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do those tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease\nStroke and diabetes\nNot mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nInterestingly enough I think God genes are pretty much involved in everything we do oh what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the quality what what is one of the genes\nDo that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role in timing sleep\nUm the the time of day you prefer to sleep time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day we're ... most of the night of what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserves your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow want fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep are not in our brains they're not in our heads\nWhile they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressed in the brain they're expressed in the body the gene that I focused on in my most recent study beam on one has expressed and the majority of tissues in which we have had a lasso ... one is what's known as the clock gene you have clocks in every cell in your\nMy most recent study be on one has expressed in the majority of tissues in which we have had a lasso beam all one is what's known as a clock seeing your clocks in every cell in your body very real\nRises o'clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it it has to be an ... and the\nTiming mechanism like gears I talked to my students about gives on the clock most of them don't know the clock yours or [laughter] talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that keep time it is an output mechanism that allows you to tell the time\nThe majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep\nOn for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your behaviors in the brain and most of the things that drivers sleep or in the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks and the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain how to sleep and more importantly how to recover from sleep loss\n[laughter] what do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low a turn the heat on your thermostat or the hit on the ... goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these work similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day\nIf you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep will go and the other direction\nThe clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it's set to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the home you just added mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me\nIs that the genes that are like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from those so when you say the clock is is that the\nThe circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily rhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant dark\nTwenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours question over here yeah I have a question about napping as I'm getting older I'm discovering that it's a really cool thing to have an [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're\nSpeaking of the cells so mapping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself than an hour and I do agree one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon\nNo one can complain they are going right at all I Know what I was ... [laughter] but you're saying nothing is important is the mapping is very important if you're not getting daily suspiciously and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a\nBusy environment may not be getting um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap an hour's usually was about recommended but I think from a half hour\nTo an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much too much of that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine if the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanism\nUm especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons\nSometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "19"}
