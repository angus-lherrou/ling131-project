right here on earth analyzing their communications the structures of their societies\nAnd brainy wave that they navigate their world as my next guest says Anita stone assistant professor of biology at California Lutheran university here in Thousand Oaks\nWelcome to science friday saying she was great to be here you know I remember a squirrel monkey that squirrel monkey from my childhood as one of the first animals went into space wow what got you fascinated with study though\nI'm I'm from Brazil and uh I went to grad school here in the states and uh I knew that I wanted to work in the Brazilian Amazon for my research\nAnd I started reading about square monkeys and became fascinated with them and then I saw them in the wild and it was just the perfect combination to look at the questions that I was interested in\nSo off I went to um Amazon in Brazil for twelve months\nAnd I thought it would just be one you know one project one season but the more time I spent there the more I became fascinated with all kinds of questions about them\nAnd I couldn't find a lot of answers in the literature because there really aren't that many people studying them in the wild\nUm I kind of know why now after so many years there are a little bit of a pain to study they're very challenging [laughter] um but yeah that's how it all started\nWow so how many do you study how many of the group a number of you study\nYeah so um the groups are very large a there but my groups have thirty to fifty animals so I monitor to a sweet groups regularly\nAnd let you do they each have each personalities of the room and you give them names they like you keep track of them\nSome squirm one of the challenges of working with ... monkeys is that because they're so small and by small I mean we're talking a kilogram max so that's about two pounds\nThere's fifty of them and they are they moved quite fast they're pretty active\nSo it's not that easy to individually identify them a particularly the juveniles because they they kind of look very similar but there are some adults that stand out you know if they have a a certain more dominant or forceful personality uh yeah they do stand out\nOkay give me a typical day and the life of a squirrel monkey [noise]\nSo square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping\n[noise] okay so square monkeys wake up really early I'm usually by five AM they're already moving out of their sleeping tree and uh they spent a lot of time active uh all day they they're nonstop\nUh they eat a fruit and they eat mostly insects and so they spend a lot of time forging in the morning for insects but really that goes on all day when it gets a little hotter in the day they tend to rest but rest for a group of ... monkeys is about ten minutes [laughter]\nUm and then they keep on you know forging and um they don't go to sleep we follow them a pretty consistently and um they don't usually go to their sleeping tree until about seven\nTo their prayer or twelve hours I hear that they have a strange way of eating grasshopper\nYes so grasshoppers are one of their favorite uh items so to speak and um they catch these pretty large grasshoppers sometimes and the way they do it the way they handle it once they grab it is they hold it by the bottom\nAnd with a head up and then they bite off the head\nKind of like an ice cream cone and then they slurp the insides and then finally they'll eat the legs and the wings sometimes\nAnd they seem very happy while they're doing it\nWow [laughter] and I understand they're not afraid to attack a while I'll watch ... [laughter] right why don't why haven't they do that yeah so\nI've only seen adults do it but I actually seen it quite a bit so what what they do is\nThey will approach a ... a a particular species\nAnd um they will knock it down very quickly to the ground so these are nest that Hank pretty low and once the adult lost desert the nest the adult a squirrel monkey will basically move in and eat all the larvae that left abandoned in the nest\nWow so they're pretty brave they're pretty bad and patient inpatient [laughter] those watch for not leaving so far right\nYeah I've done this myself we have a clip I'd like to play and then maybe you can translate for us what's going on here let's of of of of the other one of the spider markets let's let's hear that clip [noise]\n\nBut over the other one of the spider markets let's let's hear that clip [noise]\n\nGirl monkeys or spider monkey everybody does it ever is that right yeah okay tell us what we're listening to [noise]\nOkay so this was recorded in captivity um and what it sounds like to me is that these are contact calls but these are made by animals that are not very close by these are longer contact calls\nI'm so they're basically talking to each other from you know not not a very close spatial proximity\nCan can you actually tell the individual monkeys in there you can you recognize their own\nUm I can recognize yes um the the the sender and the receiver um but when there's you know ten of them in a treats kind of hard to figure out exactly you know who's who's making the vocalization\nWe have another clip that sound a little bit more how shall I put a contentious ... [noise]\n\n\nOkay so that's definitely a little squabble um it doesn't sound like a serious fight to me like something we hear in the wild um my guess is that there's an adult male at least in there making one of the noises and my guess is that there is a quick fight over some food item\nYou know it's interesting as I was listening to that it just struck me that when we we see movies have jungles or you know that that that's so sad that we hear is that right there there's usually this is those squirrel monkey so we're listening to\nIt might it might be birds actually because hormones you sound a lot like birds when you're in the forest um that's what my students usually notices that isn't that a bird and it's you have to listen to really closely to be able to identify that it's a group of score monkeys instead of bird\nHow hard was it how much time has it taken you to know the difference in to study this hour they make [noise] so\nIt's not something that I personally study but just from studying there for Eighteen years I'm from being with the monkeys um you just get used to it um it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations were but um my field assistants\nUm it's it's probably took me you know the whole twelve months to figure out what the different vocalizations or but ah my field assistant who's a local field assistant\nHe's the monkey whisper and knows everything about square monkeys and so he can tell right away if it's a bird or a troop of monkeys\nHow long have you been doing that for a little\nLonger he started with with uh a couple of years before I got there so he's been doing it for about Twenty years\nVery monkey whisper yeah well do you call him a yes sometimes he does he like he loves it [laughter] is there anything that we can learn about the human language for evolution of our language from from studying them don't squirrel monkey\n[noise] yeah so um it's interesting that you bring that up because I'm so there's a hypothesis that was proposed about Twenty years ago called the vocal grooming hypothesis\nThank you so much for your support of Georgia Public broadcasting\nSupport for ... comes from generous listeners like you in this fast paced world you want to have access to news when you need it check out our Web site at gp news dot org we've got the latest state national and international news available twenty four seven\nBut they're also in depth feature stories from across the state of Georgia you can also view video performances from great musicians in our gp music present series\nFor information and entertainment you can count on DVD news ... news dot org\n[noise] the market plunges and President Trump signed the target to blame I think this is\nFor the shortage of making a mistake\nKid gets despite that we're doing very well I Know that change will talk to a former fed official about\nWhat the president's attacks me for the institution this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News four to seven on G. P. B. and B. news dot org [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year salmon and go on the most important\n[noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow you know every year salmon and go on the most important journey of their lives after living years in the wild\nWild oceans they must swim back to the coast to one very particular river mouth and then ... miles of tributaries branches upstream until they finally finally arrive in the little freshwater spring where they were born how did he do this well like in\nAny good trip yeah you need a map and not just a compass just telling you wearing north is you also need to know the location of the place you're going to get to is it straight north isn't more north east\nEast than south well you know a few years ago researchers concluded that what they had long suspected that Pacific salmon can detect the magnetic field lines of beer beer map is they're magnetic\nAnd what about their Lansing dwelling cousins and when you let fish living quiet landlocked lines you know\nThey lived their whole lives with dozens of generations landlocked what happens to that math here to explain more is Michelle Scanlon a faculty research assistant Oregon State University in Corvallis welcome to science friday\nThank you for having me\nYou know I just I just said it but but sandman living impressive lives right they travel all that way how many miles to their journeys tech\n[noise] that's pretty impressive and their journey can be hundreds or even thousands of miles to their oceanic forging grounds\nFan and they usually ... of these tiny streams miles inland and I have to go back there [noise] that's correct and they don't just have to navigate upstream may have to find the right stream to go how do they do this and that they don't have a well maybe they do have a GPS of some sort in\n[noise] in the same and have a diverse array of tools that they use in order to navigate and so when they reach streams are they generally with their sense of smell\nBut in terms of the oceanic journeys and voyages that they use something more broad scale and and the term we think they're using magnetic nap and they make information\nNow I Know that your research is looking at a different group of salmon the Atlantic salmon what what makes them so interesting to you [noise]\nYour research is looking at a different group of Sam ... lap exam and what what makes them so interesting to you [noise]\nIt was rather interesting opportunity because the Atlantic salmon that we use for this study are actually descendants of individuals\nThat were transferred from a landlocked lake\nIn Maine to a landlocked lake in Oregon over sixty years ago for recreational fishery so these fish had never had access to the Pacific ocean and I've never sat than outside of a lake or in the instance of our fish outside of hatchery\nAnd yet you frown but they still have these two magnetic maps in there that they would have needed that they knocked ... that's correct and our neighbor to retain these in one\nThat's an interesting question a so Salman when they use magnetic information they can use in different aspects of the magnetic field especially for math\nAnd so the earth's magnetic field has a couple of different components one is the strength of the magnetic field or also known as my dad field intensity and so those intensities are stronger\nAt the polls and weaker at the equator another aspect\nOf the field that they can use is called a inclination angle and that's the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the earth\nAnd so they're steeper toward the polls and shallower at the equator and both of these components predict or favorably are predictably variable across the surface of the globe\nSuper convenient because these gradients of intensity and inclination angles aren't parallel flee former type of by coordinate grid over much of the earth and so animals can actually derive both latitude and longitude all information from the magnetic field\nTo have little magnets in their bodies that can do that [noise]\nSo they're the mechanisms behind Meg NATO reception are are still unclear but one of the leading hypotheses is that\nA salmon and other species have tiny chains of magna tight and that is an iron oxide mineral that has magnetic property and so these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic\nWell these chains of mango tight are associated with nerve cells and the thought is that the change can be pulled by or strength magnetic fields and so changes in both the field strings and or the inclination angle can result in action potentials\nDo these ... structures are thought to be found in the nose\nAnd also the latter alliance along the sides of the body of a fish but the ... meter receptor itself a is still elusive\nAnd why why do the important to you why why does it matter that they can still detect these\nFields [noise] well it's\nA rather interesting question [noise] so we wanted to know whether landlocked members of species that could go to the ocean retain a map than\nJust a point of curiosity and we also wanted to know um if it land examine also possesses ability it's another group of individuals that\nDoes ethnic maps of diverse amount of no amounts of these days but we also wanted to know what happens when you test animals in novel sort of magnetic environments one can they even detect the magnetic field\nBut to can they actually differentiate between those fields and three how do they actually respond\nAnd so how did you go about testing research [noise]\nSo and the eggs from the individuals at the lake in Oregon were transported to the organ hatchery Research Center where they were reared and subsequently tested\nAnd so we tested these individuals' using a series of magnetic coil and essentially it's a series of wouldn't friends that are wrapped in copper wire\nAnd when you attach copper wires to an electrical power supply\nAnd crank electric current through the magnetic coil a byproduct of that\nElectricity is a magnetic field and the really cool part about are coils is that allows us to alter the direction and also the average of current in order to allow us to simulate magnetic fields from almost anywhere on earth\nSo what you're doing it over my basic physics you know in grade school them if I take a magnetized object and put it next to some mentally will magnum pi the mental in a certain direction so that sounds to me basically what you're doing to assure you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures\nIn a certain direction so that sounds to me basically what you're doing to the Fisher you magnify them setting beer magnetic structures up to to know where they are in a certain direction [noise]\nYes so we're present them with magnetic fields essentially that hopefully interact with what we think are these tiny chains of tight right that somehow connect within ourselves\nRight and and so having a fish respond to this [noise]\nSo we evaluate the movement ... by censoring the fish in the ... so there's a a platform with a bunch of testing arenas we have one fish Purina and then we have cameras that are mounted above those testing arenas to give us a bird's eye view of the test subjects during the trials\nSo what this means is that we are generating thousands of photos of our fish and so we take photos and we assess the position of the fishes head relative to magnetic north\nWow that's terrific and and you know uh do do you know how good the resolution they have is I mean you know how just how accurate they can be to these magnetic fields [noise] that is\nA question for future research so we don't know the how finer core scale to make those maps as yeah\nSo what so ... speaking of looking forward what would you like to do what kind of other experiments or equipment would you like to have to test these fish again\nSo we have a whole number of ... of experiments that we have talked about over the years but one of the experiments would be to actually look at Maine magnetic resolution of this map so having the theory that points moving them closer and closer together and to see how finer core scale their responses actually are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "12"}
