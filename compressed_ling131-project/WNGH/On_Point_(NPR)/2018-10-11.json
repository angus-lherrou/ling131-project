written about why his new book is called the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we have an excerpt of it at a point radio dot org\nThat's the geo pie and he's written about why his new book is called the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we have an excerpt of it at one point radio dot org\nAnd you can call and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk or if you're a Republican and you happen to agree with Max Boot about you're concerned about where the GOP is headed what do you think we ought to do to address those concerns\nBut if you're a Republican who thinks the party is exactly where it needs to be right now representing your interest in doing so with a full throated passion call us as well what's your thought for ... were at one eight hundred forty three to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk\nNow ... ... ... in the last segment you mentioned um what what you call a GOP quote unquote total ... who are have been surrounding and supporting President Trump exactly what do you mean by that\nAll the people who who basically flat or his ego including people like Lindsey Graham who once called them ... now\nOh talks about how Donald Trump as a superb Gulf or I mean I I I have to our chapter and verse in my book of of of the ... of Donald Trump who literally refer to him as if he were the second coming who think that he's the savior of humanity I mean it's unbelievable this was a\nPresident or you know who was only has the support or about forty percent of Americans and and that's too high in my book but most people recognize\nThat he is not an honorable figure but what's really shocking to me is the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed himself into a Donald Trump called I mean so many people have drink the Kool Aid including people but I once had respect for it's it's really been a gut wrenching and soul crushing experience for me to see what's going on well\nUh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by one now\nI I think some folks might remember this because some of the cabinet members looked quite uncomfortable and we're careful to avoid flattering the president directly\nBut for many of the others um they did heap praise upon a President Trump now the whole sort of a person by person\nMoment took about eleven minutes we're not going to play all of that obviously we've significantly cut it down but here's some of the the flattery that members of the cabinet war heaping upon the president in June two thousand Seventeen\nLeave for our health services at this time of year\nLeave for our health and Human Services at this pivotal time under your leadership I Can't thank you for the religious\nShift is you show I Want to thank you\n... senior staff\nThe opportunity to have given us or erosion\nThe last year an even greater on her to be here serving\nSo you heard their vice president Mike Pence then secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price transportation secretary Elaine Chao and then chief of staff writes previous and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin [laughter]\nUh no ... you know many of these people can you explain a well they're they're ... seemingly unquestioning unquestioning feel the to the president\nIt's it's really a cult and what the un I think that they feel it's necessary because they understand\nThat that Donald Trump is an egomaniac who is also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes anybody who praises him whether it's his cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on\nBut you know that that tape but you played some is to my mind is one of the most revolting an on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this was something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this is not what should be happening in the White House the people's houses and our constitutional republic\nWhere we do not elect Donald Trump as king he supposed to be the president charged with them forcing the laws\nAnd yet he was being treated by those around him as a few of the leader of a religious cult profoundly dangerous\nTo be totally cynical about this still Max Boot is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity and this party is around the president of the United states\nForgive me maybe I'm naive but I Do think the politicians have a higher duty to their country until the constitution and they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans that I once respected people like Paul Ryan Marco Rubio Lindsey Graham an on and on and on\nWho have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in in in public what I Know they they understand in ...\nLindsey Graham an on and on and on who have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in in in public what I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is utterly unfit to be president and why won't they do that because they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the\nThe Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against him he lost his reelection\nOkay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people the worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection but better to lose reelection than to lose their principles and they have lost their principals they have lost their way very very dismaying to see\n... foot in the right way to ask it but it but can't the argument would be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making in the book that those very principles do or what got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your list for support in in the early to thousands for for the Iraq War and there are many people today\nWho who cast their vote for President Trump because they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of edge of international elitism gone arrived that that was that was money and effort that should have been spent right here in the United states he seems like there were many conservative\nA a a principled conservatives who supported the Iraq War and two thousand three ... those same people surrounding themselves or their surrounding the president right now so what is it not inevitable in a way that we arrived here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including\nA the mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an item that\nDiscredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy and I I ride in the book and in in what I think as we try to do in a very honest and soul searching way\nAbout my own responsibility for getting here I was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with Seventy two percent of the population but I was certainly more prominent than than most of that Seventy two percent and for years I was very defensive about the disaster that ensued and refused to completely renounced my decision and now with\nThe clarity of hindsight I'm looking back and and trying to figure out in my way forward I've\nI I mean I make a clean breast of it in the book and I say you know this was a mistake and I was\nAnd I was wrong to have advocated the war this is a terrible\nDisaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I and I think that other you know supporters and architects of the war\nThe war this is a terrible disaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I\nKnow and I think the other you know supporters and in architects of the war should take ownership of it as well and and there's of course the irony is that Donald Trump himself was a supporter of the war even though you won't admit it now but but there is no question that these kinds of miscalculations lead the way\nA an open the way to Trump ism which you know I think it was\nIt was a catastrophe for America and the world far worse than what we've seen in the past because he is a you know undermining our democracy what those attacks on the rule of law he's undermining American leadership abroad undermining American allies use opening the way for dictators so\nYou know this was a terrible situation but you know we have to be honest and and admit\nThat the Republican establishment was not blameless in getting us here\nYeah well we're speaking with max ... is our his new book

going to go to a couple of callers here because they've got a lot to say so let's turn to Steven\nCalling from Norfolk, Virginia a Virginia excuse me Stephen you're on the air\n[noise] I'm not going to max thanks for taking my call\nSo I'm a I'm a moderate a Democrat probably closer to independent and my biggest concern is that I recognize that there's value in bowl conservatism or protecting individual rights\nWhile at the same time trying to come together society girl society and my biggest concern is that you see these fringes that are just pushing further further right and left she both protect\nThe greedy and protect the lazy or respectively so you know it seems like gosh I'm getting holding these two directions and uh you know here's the whole trial or you know polling pulling polling towards\nThe greedy and is millions and it just it is\nIncredibly frustrating for people like me in the middle that uh you know can't find a way so I'm just wondering if you could comment on that\nSteven thanks for your call ... go ahead\nWell I feel Stevens paying I mean I feel exactly the same way I I'm politically homeless I I Can't be part of this Trump provide Republican Party but I don't feel comfortable being part of the Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren party either and so on you know I'm I'm stranded in the middle I think\nYou know look I think Democrats have an opportunity here because I think there are a lot of disaffected voters who could not be part of what Donald Trump is selling but they don't know about the Democrats either because a lot of Democrats seem pretty extreme for them like I I'm In that category if Democrats are I think\nBut Donald Trump is selling but they don't know about the Democrats either because a lot of Democrats seem pretty extreme for them like I I I'm In that category\nIf Democrats I think go to the center there can be a historic realignment of American politics of the kind that you saw in the Nineteen thirties I Would make the Democrats the majority party for fifty years to come I think the way they do that is by nominating somebody who was pretty centrist in twenty twenty and not going to to the progress of extreme\nAll the all the forces that we've seen in terms of the primary process in terms of campaign finance the things that are be leader the Republican Party some of the things that believes Republican Party also believe that the Democrats as well I mean do you do you think they are in the in the twenty twenty cycle that the Democrats might actually\nNominate a centrist versus someone who's on the more progressive wing\nOh I think anything is possible I mean who would've imagined that the Republicans would nominate Donald Trump uh twenty six things so we don't know who the Republican not who the Democratic nominee is going to being twenty twenty but there\nIs no question that almost all of the major contenders the people that are being talked about his nominees potential nominees are certainly from the progressive wing of the party on and that concerns me is as somebody who's uh who's more of a of a centrist center ripe a person\nYeah let's go to Jim who's calling from St Petersburg Florida until you're on the air\nThank you and I guess my my question has to do with the fact that a Christian I talked to a lot of my friends on it and let me see straight into politics most of my Christian friends are consider themselves conservative Christians are and they don't even have to say that the Republican\nUh whereas um most of my other friends who might be other denominations are some type of liberal Democrats\nOr when I find that people that aren't religious or a Republican but they did gay or minority whatnot it usually has to do with the money that they and wanting to be able to preserve their money or their future so the question is is as a liberal Democrat Christian\nI thought is that for the good of the world we're supposed to take care of each other and all of our government is to make sure that everybody gets by everybody had it all Egypt is either happiness\nOn my question what was the original point of having a conservative wing of the party back when he joined and it did the uh the influx of the religious right in any way sway your decision to at the end of the\nJoke saying yeah Jo thanks for your call go ahead max\nThe religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back to the Nineteen sixties uh in\nIt just thanks for your call go ahead max\nPulled the religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back\nTo the Nineteen sixties uh and it's dismaying to me to see what happened with ... with with that one of the party that the ... I mean I agree with a lot of 'em in in the late Nineteen nineties when they were cast the getting Bill Clinton for misconduct for embarrassing the country for lowering our our moral tone I I thought that was correct\nBut now these very same people these arch more or less than colds\nWho are criticizing Bill Clinton have nothing to say about Donald Trump's transgressions that you know this was a president who was violated federal law in order to pay off a playboy playmate on a porn star that he had allegedly had affairs with us as a\nPresident who has been credibly accused of massive tax fraud this was a president who lies eight times a day you know I'm reminded of\nOf of a bill Bennett ... book from Nineteen Ninety eight or Nineteen Ninety nine called the death of outrage where he was lamenting the fact that more people were not outraged\nAbout Bill Clinton's misbehavior well the death of outrage is actually pretty good description of the of the of the Christian right ah today including people like Bill Bennett where they have nothing to say\nAbout the shocking immorality of the president that they support\n[noise] ... I Want to return to something that we talked about a little bit earlier for a second that we should spend more time on and that's the question whether this issue of race or and and how that is shaped direction the Republican Party is going in because I I I'm thinking of\nUm you know the number of times he pointed out several uh where the president has said things even before he was elected and after that many people looked upon and said that that was racist but\nDid you pay for a moment around him you know thinking of house Speaker Paul Ryan going so far as to release a statement saying yes that was a textbook racist remarks but and but nevertheless I'm going to still support the United states because of all he's helping deliver on tax cuts which are important to a lot of people and conservative judges which are also important\nTo a lot of people so for as long as that's you know your your term ... bargain exists what how do you have\nA for change if the if the change has to come within the party structure as well\nI have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer repeated and devastating defeats\nThey have to know there'll be a political price to pay for trafficking and bigotry and prejudice for political gain there is nothing I've seen in American political life in my lifetime that is more despicable than this they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nPolitical gain there is nothing I've seen in American political life in my lifetime that is more despicable than those they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nThey are claiming that they can support Donald Trump because he used for tax cuts and then they ignore everything else including all of his racist baggage when he you know we're undocumented immigrants this is a disgrace and the Republican Party is displacing itself by going along with this\nWell let's go to another call here Ira is calling from Myrtle Beach South Carolina Ira you're on the air\n... backs food boots I Would like to take my hat off to you\nI Am in total application of the courage to your show and the intelligence analysis\nYou will absolutely correct about the current situation it can be no doubt and he married a woman on Saturday would face down from the late I'm come out for what he is a true ... total dictator and another Hitler\nHowever I'd like to tell you there's no need just to be on the despair we our great nation we went through the hard and fast\nOf the civil war and we bonded a mood to gather to choke I'm sixty is to probably do it we pretty much gone it now but the one people who will never recover\nA has a democracy we will recover but evangelists people who support Trump eighty one percent and now we're in Ninety One percent they shall never recover their their chance to be a religious or moral ...", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "11"}
