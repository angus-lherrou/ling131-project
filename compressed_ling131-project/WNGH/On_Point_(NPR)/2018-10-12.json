on Facebook at on point radio my guest this hour windy wise or of the Brennan Center for justice at NYU and Dale ... of the ACLU\nOr you know the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia Stacey Abrams has spent her her years of late as an activist registering residents devote proponent Brian Kemp is Georgia's secretary of state and I think there's a really unusual consequence of careers focused on the issue of voting right at the ballot box right\nStacey Adams appeared Abrams excuse me appeared on MSNBC yesterday discuss the tens of thousands of voter registration applications currently on hold it in the state of Georgia she's accused her of Conan Brian Kemp of repressing citizens right to vote\nThat challenge is this process called exact match and we've been fighting on the sets twenty fourteen\nWhat happens is that he had a hyphen in your last name it have to have a difficult spelling and anyone misspelled or lose leaves out anything they can use that as a pet basically as a reason\nTo not processor registration and that means that of that fifty three thousand Georgians currently have their registration intending status technically they can cast provisional ballots the provisional ballots are often not\nProcessed and said we're deeply worried at fifty three thousand people Seventy percent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised in this election\nUh Dale hotel me uh what would Brian Kemp say if he were here and uh how do you assess that argument it's pretty difficult for me to challenge now I'd like to hear it\nSomeone like I'm Brian capital I guess he would say is we need to make sure that the people who are registering are actually the people who they claimed to be and therefore we need to impose strict standards on whether or not we process an application but I think what's really critical here is that\nA minor typo like a missing hyphen or the transportation of two letters on a someone's entering a voter registration form into a database that shouldn't be a basis for disenfranchising people\nAnd one thing to underscore I think is the fact that people who are on this list I don't want there to be any confusion all of those people can still vote\nIn November they might not show up on regular voter registration rolls but they all still have the right to show up at the polls and cast a provisional ballot that's not a perfect solution because provisional ballots are counted under different rules um been regular balance but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged I liked it\n[noise] because provisional ballots are counted under different rules um been regular balance but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged I'd like to take a call now from away cross Georgia John go ahead you're on the air\nYes I was calling I'm about the uh the um now when you file your tax returns in most states you have to put in your driver's license information in to get your tax return process\nIncluding earned income credit and other credits that the people that you're saying are being disenfranchised um have that because they want to get those refunds so so I don't see how people are being disenfranchised by using and not be when you\nThink you so much John we'd also like to take a call from Appleton, Wisconsin I Believe it's Mark Mark you're on the air\nI accurate taking my call just turned ... what\nBothers me this and it's rarely discussed is the fact that every one of these voter ID laws is always tied to serious restrictions to access to the polls either reducing the polling places polling time um when they're clerks offices are open to file absentee ballots which was the case here in ... in Wisconsin\nSo it's not just about ... it seems to me that undermines his argument it's about voter fraud it's about reducing people's rights to vote\nThank you so much for that mark joining me now from Tuscaloosa, Alabama someone who may help address some of these questions are from a different perspective I John Merrill is the secretary of state for the state of Alabama since taking office in twenty Fifteen more than one million new voters\nHad been registered in that state the Alabama process requires voters as I understand it to show a photo ID when voting John Merrill welcomed on point\nDavid great to be with you thanks for having me as your guest\nYes sir tell me just from the ... what's your approach to ah to to having voters on the roles\nWell David we will teach in every eligible US citizen is a resident of Alabama to be registered to vote and have a photo lab day\nAnd we have gone to extra links to make sure that people are accommodating whenever that occurs\nAnd we did all six seven counties at least one time every year with our mobile units as well as having our board registrars office opened each and every day that the court houses open in all six to seven county\nAnd we visit festivals events an activity in our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people\nSix to seven counties and we visit festivals events in activities in our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity to register and to obtain IDs if they don't have one now I Would also tell you that in the rare instances where people say\nHey I Can't get to the board registrars office because my work schedule or I Can't get to one of the mobile unit location because it's not convenient or I don't go to the events were festivals in those rare occasions where that has happened David we're going to people's homes\nAnd we have given an F ... days in their homes and we're very excited about what we've achieved during the last three years and then months in twenty three days that I've had the privilege to be Alabama sectors state\nWe've read you one million Ninety five thousand a hundred and sixty one new voters and we now have three million four hundred and thirty four thousand eight hundred and sixty three registered voters in Alabama those numbers are unprecedented and unfair low in the history of the state\nWhat's the need for the for the voter id\nWell the reason that I voted for David Was because I Want to make it easier to vote and hard to ...\nIf you needed a day when you open a bank account if you're needing a day when you go to the movie if you need an ad they when you buy a six pack of beer or if you buy a pack of cigarettes then you ought to be able to present and not be when you exercise the most precious rat that we have\nTo participate in our Democrat Republican is a vote\nI Want to take a really a general I Want to take a call from a nearby states from Louisiana New Orleans I've Sharon on the line churns share your thoughts on this\nThank you for taking my call just man in Louisiana you've had to show and I have an id with your voter registration um for all the years we've been here which is over twenty\nHowever the the ID now has changed you have to have a real id to vote and the ... id is requires you to a show a birth certificate Social Security card and to um a friend and a two documents\nUm but they don't tell you you need that you know find out about the real ID until you go and get your driver's license renewed it so if you're not in the schedule to get your driver's license renewed but for the next time your vote\nYou go and get your driver's license training so if you're not in the schedule and get your driver's license renewed before next time your vote and you realize you need a ... and ah you won't be able to do\nSo I think Sharon Sharon thank you so much for that it appreciate that John Merrill your secular state in Alabama ... some of the specifics interest 'cause he's maybe a little different than Louisiana nonetheless ... David and just\nTo remember that they vary from state to state\nI mean we have ten different elements that can be a change to use when you go to vote including your driver's license or non driver id or the free Alabama voter id we give any other valid state issue that the federal id\nA student at the passport a military id travel at the\nUh we just want to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat period that's it and we ...

I think it's something that everybody needs to know\nI also think it's important to note when it comes to automatic voter registration which is what you're talking about there's a different definition for what automatic voter registration means to certain people now one of the questions\nThat I raise whenever somebody introduces the concept to me is it that you believe that if you have automatic registration in your state but there should be an opt out provision\nAnd an opt out provision would mainly just somebody says no I don't want to be registered than they should be given the opportunity to keep from being registered when they engage in that activity will be getting your driver's license getting social services or whatever happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision than what I immediately tell them is that what we have the day you just have to opt in which is why we've had Ninety three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very very excited about this\nDeal oh sure I think anyone who's\nEver been in a system where you have to opt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different and that the yield very very different levels\nOf participation now in the abstract you might think that those things are very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of off in system through the DMV right now other states have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates\nSky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every eligible person in Alabama is registered to vote and the easiest way to do that used to create an opt out supposed\nTo we're getting callers suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington Virginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid thank you take one call ... windy day of secretary morals ... what would you think of potentially creating a holiday whether it be a state holiday are you going to propose that perhaps\nDo you ... what would you think of potentially a creating a holiday whether it be a state holiday or even a proposed that perhaps the national level to\nUm have an official day off for voting whether or not that it'd be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that potentially more people would have the opportunity to actually votes\nOr I'll take the response off the air thank you thanks very secretary\nBarry I think it's important to know that it's been my observation in my experience that people vote when it's important to [noise] and if you say well if we had voting on Saturday or if we had vote and own a day that was specified as a holiday that it would potentially increase\nThe turnout well when we broken every record the history of the state in the last three major elections we've had the empirical data\nAs they all said speaks for itself which is that people come when they want to vote we as a\nSecretary ... let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously ... turn out to you sir I'm Sorry state Folkenflik\nOr ... you know there's obviously really interest to win one more and Doug Jones we're going off in that in that a special Alabama race right outside of the elites and people really turned out but what would make you think that people\nAre ... wouldn't turned out more if they didn't have the day off from work I mean there are a lot of folks for whom that uh that takes him to the roof\nBecause this is what I Know I Know that when we had the presidential election November the eight two thousand six thing where to point one million Alabamians go to the polls Seventy two percent of people that were registered voter", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "12"}
