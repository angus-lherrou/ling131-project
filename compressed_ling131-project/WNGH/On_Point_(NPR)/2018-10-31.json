preeminent a costume designer who was telling\nThe visual stories of African Americans on film through the fabric that she puts her actors and actresses and again we're at eight hundred forty three eight to five five\nRuthie Carter let me ask you could just jump back in time deep back in time here because I\nRead a in a previous interview that you gave that um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on how you see the world and maybe how you even got into to costume designer is that right\nYes um when I was a younger ah say junior high school and through high school my mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker was the free counseling service for the city and\nPeople could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew homeless people she knew people you know um there was a guy named Tina and my mother knew about him and\nSo we would ride with her and to um you know downtown or down go to ... she'd drop us off to school and we see certain people and we laugh in point or hide you know hide in the\nBack seat and my mom would say you know he looks okay he's gotta clean shirt on today and she could you know and just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause in which kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know some time she would even role that window down to our dismay and say you\nKnow ... how George you know how are you today\nAnd you know that kind of a view of you know people is what I still used today to\nKind of embrace a individuality and that it helps with embracing culture and embracing people and places and you know just taking it all in\nYou know because it suddenly occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly occurred should if I Know there's a long time ago but\nBill and places and you know just taking it all in\nYeah you know suddenly occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly occurred should if I Know there's a long time ago but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear is a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the world of who we are\nAnd when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film that essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story a and so now they want to communicate that to the world constructed in that film and then to us as viewers\nYes I feel that costume design a can be just to find his story telling design and you when people want to associate costume design with fashion\nAnd you know that's\nKind of in the world of costume design but\nThe overall a I'm a goal is to tell the story to work within a larger story of the script but and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story with what they wear right\nSo so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm ... in Hollywood I mean well let me just let me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee because you've done what Fifteen plus collaborations with him\nAnd yes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter]\nUm I met Spike Lee in Los Angeles a friend who's a casting director now Robbie read introduced me to him\nHe actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for and it in the lobby I was showing my portfolio to one of my friends and\nAh I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all\nYou know wanted to hang out together and we did and he kept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my sights set so I kept you know modeling around him I had this idea of getting film experience and he suggested\nThat I call USC or UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student thesis project he said that\nAnd he suggested that I call us see or UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student thesis project and he said that would give me experience with being on a set and what that medium um would be like yeah and\nSo I did and before I knew it on a Saturday I was\nOn a U.S see students ...\nAre doing the costumes are well\nAnd then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right\nThing so I Want to play a clip well now a days it was actually the first one and then do the right then do the right thing okay I wouldn't be less likely found that they're like get your fill a logger iffy right leg [laughter] mostly just go\nDo the right thing is such an amazing movie is it as day so I wouldn't want to play a quick clip from here I'm this is a scene where you're going to hear a John John ... who plays bugging out and he asked so the owner of the local pizzeria played by debt halo\nOr why they're only pictures of white celebrities on the wall of his pizza shop\nA little more brothers on Wall Street Journal which would you\nWant your brother is an awful and nieces and nephews your stepfather stepmother whoever wants to see what this is my story\nAnd it's hot as long as\nThere might be fine now what do you watch the any American I use my books we read as much money we do have\nA scene from Spike Lee is Nineteen eighty nine do the right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer uh on that one of many collaborations she had was Spike Lee ... and the thing about this film a ruse if I may say is that it really\nOne of many powers as it captures this particular moment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality of what the characters are wary like high tops the boom boxes that the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely how does that play out in your design\nWell it was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color Nike was a huge part of a a clothing or during that time and a guys\nReally saturated color on Nike was a huge part of a a clothing or during that time and a guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and we really wanted to represent you know pop culture of the moment and\nReally create this um this intensity of color in their environment\nAnd so what we did was we created like top side of African fabrics and you see bugging out wearing can take cloth shorts that we made and it was also the hottest day of the year and you know it was it was kind of thing in New York where when it got really really had\nThat stuff will go down you know there could be riots there could be shootings and so because of the heat the intensity of the heat the intensity and the saturation of the color and\nAre joined Emily Jones for

design for everything from do the right thing\nTo the butler to what flubbed got to do with it and so much as well and I wanted to just play a quick clip\nFrom Selma and you're going to hear David yellow he of course played the role of river Dr Martin Luther king in ... twenty fourteen film and is seen he's giving a speech before leading a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nAnd he's wearing a suit with a with a black and peel striped tie and a styling black overcome\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThe from the to those fourteen film Selma Ruthie Carter here's one of the cases several cases in which you were doing a film a depicting an act you know an actual person from history so how did you go about deciding how to design the clothing for you know for David who's playing Dr King well there\nAre several images that I could draw from of Martin Luther king there's several books pictorial books that have been written and so the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design um one uh is\nBut I have been written and so the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design um one uh is that I'm a Martin Luther king was busted men and\nIf you look at him and his suit you noticed that you know there's a little fleshy area around the color of his neck where he buttoned his shirt and it would\nKind of rule over the top and David are yellow the brilliant actor that he is he gained weight for the role um and I wanted to sort of\nHelp that along and I made his assure callers so at least smaller than what we what would be required so that I can also see that little ... that happened I'm at the collar of king shirt I Love that detail [laughter] I don't think I Would have ever\nNoticed but it's all it's all what goes into sort of the whole experience of sort of occupying a character yeah and the costume has\nTo support the actor there has to help support their performance and\nI'm just looking at a lot of black and white photographs you have to create a color palette that supports the mood of the story as well as isn't accurate depiction of the colors during that time but it David ... colors were to type ... he never ... and I would say he never complained\nUm maybe it just felt right right for him and uh when I hear that that performance in particular I really hear Martin Luther king more than I hear David a yellow all\nRight well we're at one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk coast with your questions for the Carter and how she tells he's African American stories through fabric on these amazing films that we've been talking about well let's go to Sarah who's calling from Lowell, Massachusetts Sara you're on the air\nI'm not an hello ms Carter I Am so excited that you are having a show talking about this when I saw a Black Panther in the theater I was just blown\nAway not only
