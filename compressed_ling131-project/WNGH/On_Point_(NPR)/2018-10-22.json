produced into something of legend and of mythology and magic\nYeah can I saw about those stories I mean over the course of the ten seasons of drag racing for for folks who don't know actually I should let you explain for folks who don't know what the show is I mean but how would you describe will drag races\nWell it's a competition reality show where we are looking for America's next drug superstar and we put the\nCompetitors through a series of challenges\nThat are not unlike what my career has been I've done everything you could you name it in show business so the challenges are geared towards you know being a radio host or a TV producer or a model or acting all those things\nAnd at the end the two competitors who are\nAt the bottom who get the least points have to lip sync for their lives and ah\nThey lip sync and or whoever does the best gets to stay on the one who doesn't have to leave the competition\nAnd you always remind them too don't bleep it up okay that's as close to them

challenges that you just talked about the fun and\nErnest spectacularly already making up words now a of the drag queens the the the challenges that you just talked about the fun and the incredible hulk road I'm surprised that more of the queen's just don't have a nervous breakdown on the phone every episode\nBut with each passing season we've also seen a lot more of their personal stories as well and I just wanted to play a little bit of a montage of three moments where we learned some very\nIncredible things are about some of these drag queens say here are those moments\nWhen they got me exercise because they thought I was engaging in\nI was so confused after the whole thing went down because straight now\nI just wanted to fade I've been always so for that [noise]\nBut I've been

right yeah you know that the the show\nChallenges the contestants to\nFiguratively die and become reborn into their high yourself\nAnd when I look back on my own life I realized that the worst things that happened to me ended up being the best thing that happened to me because I got to understand what real strength is and what my own strength is and I think the people watching our show\nUh they get that and they they understand that at the core of our show it's about the tenacity of the human spirit and how you\nAre an extension of the power that created the whole universe he couldn't access that power at any time but what you know when you're\nAn extension of the power that created the whole universe he couldn't access that power at any time but what you know when you're pressed in those

butterfly this violent metamorphosis\nBeauty will emerge and that's what we watch it on our show every season after season we see these kids who have gone through a lot and they they emerge as great beauties and heroes\nYou know and and the thing about the show is that there's that intimacy and the challenges but ... as you said earlier there's also fun being drag queen drama and just straight up

gave me the star\nShe presented me with the star in the Hollywood walk of fame but I've always admired her just because of how many lives that woman has been able to fit into one lifetime and not coming to this\nPlanet I always felt like the boy who failed or a that was always my goal and that's why drag or shape shifting or wearing all these different hats in show business has always been my goal and I've always looked up to her for that but um before that I just it on her show grace and Frankie a\nWith a Lily Tomlin and it was absolutely beautiful and that's coming up on the next season of grace in Frank\nYeah [laughter] well you know we told folks over social media that we were going to be\nTalking to you are today and we got so many questions from them that I I don't want to give them short shrift you mind if I ask you some of the questions that we got sent to us here\nI don't mind if you don't mind me saying I don't want to answer\nThat [laughter]\n'cause you know isn't you know people have a lot of ideas and that's that's cute but uh you know we'll see okay here we got\nOkay how about this how about a ... okay how does this is a pretty easy one how about this what Dan church wants to know that he'd be interested to know what the change in the audience for a drag race with more teens and young people watching has influence how you conceive and produced the show\nNo it hasn't you know our goal is always been to a to celebrate the art of drag and the art of\nThe people behind drag and and tell their stories\nBecause it's it's it's a very unique person and personality who's able to ah change themselves and and to die voluntarily die and become reborn into another\nIncredible image of their own imagination there's something very very important there so uh know what happens is we produce the show and then we add the queens who were different every year every season and it takes on a a life of its own\nSo we've got a couple of questions here from folks who want to know how the mainstreaming of drag a and in part driven by the success of this\nIt's on a a life of its own\nSo we've got a couple of questions here from folks who want to know how the mainstreaming of drag or in part driven by the success of the show\nMay may have changed the community itself that's because under son she wants to know that and someone calling themselves Django James uh wants to know what's the best way to tackle the racial bias issues that have become more apparent in drag race fandom as the show becomes mainstream\nWell those are two big questions after the first one is drag will never be mainstream drag will never be mainstream because uh in our ego driven culture the idea of shape shifting which is what drag is I'm a ... will never take cold because the ego will not accept\nThe idea of someone changing their identity we our whole\nCulture is based on a density of consumer culture is there to sell beer and shampoo and they want to pinpoint who you are what you're buying habits are and what your belief system is and drag is the opposite of that drag says who now I'm this didn't oh now in that\nSo drag will never be mainstream\nUh now I'm you know racial issues it's it's um with within the drag it what ... what happens is um we eat a lot of young people who have ideas of of of their own right and they walk into our show as a viewer with different ideas\nUm I I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with\nUm the fact that a lot of young people\nThey gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show\nWill have way more a social media followers than someone who is not blonde and wind so that speaks to us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this earth\nI'm a I it has very little to do with\nOur show because our show I Believe we cast our show is the most diverse ... a a cast in television we have we cast everybody in fact I think\nUh uh this past season without giving anything away well yeah because I was going to I was going to be a good little T say who we have on this show um uh\nThe ... season without giving anything away well yeah because I was going to I was going to be a good little T because they who we have on the show um uh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\nI'll just say that much [laughter] you have your token white folks with a way out so well listen\nYou know we we cash the show based on the criteria is one is charisma unique there's nerve and talent that's how we cast the show if you got it Iran\nAnd they do okay so I just haven't been resisting asking this question but I just have to know a [laughter]\n'cause I'm a huge ... fan and and ... and all her fans are still wounded from the fact that that that you you dropped her from the showing that in that great lip sync between her and trixie Mattel\n[laughter] and I just don't think she was named what's happened there well\nWe we uh first of all you need and so Rob because share Angela is almost steals the ... the movie stars born she's in that movie and she does a great job in that\nBut the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner or even as you played the clip of MySpace Angie\nShe did one episode and became an in tuned she's all star so you know um nobody loses if if you're on the show your winter\nOkay so that actually leads me to say something else that I wanted to ask you about because", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "22"}
