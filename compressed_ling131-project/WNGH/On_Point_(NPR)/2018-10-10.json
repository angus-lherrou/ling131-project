transracial adoption and in her search for her identity and what difference it made to her\nWhen she actually sought out the truth of the story of her biological family were one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk uh Nicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up and your life\n[laughter] um but but just\nThe right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I Want to get a sense of ... you're not saying that you never felt\nI think when I got the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I\nWant to get a sense of ... you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt among okay hadn't yeah 'cause 'cause I think\nPart of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not opened up of adopted children mind you but and I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that that your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race\nI mean thinking about this from their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is\nUm I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just things I Wish I had in my toolkit but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed this to me that they wish they had\nBeen offered more in the way of information not like warning that don't think they would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing that I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with him about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family um that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know\nI'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we've gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you ask many questions just nobody really was telling them these are some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how you answer this question or\nYou know talk to your child about racism and nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to to to have those conversations I think okay\nNow so I can hear it fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that you talked about uh was was something ... difficult enough to handle 'em or know know what to do with how to come through that\nIn addition to that ... was there was there all along and that you had um\nKnow what to do with how to come through that\nBut in addition to that ... was there was there all along and that you had um it just sort of internally with racism aside to sort of was there a longing or an emptiness for something that you felt that needed to be filled because of\nYou know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're complex and as you saw it with your parents yeah I think it was\nIt wasn't so much an empty nest or like I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did keenly feel once I was old enough to notice and once I was old enough to have it pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly\nUm I in a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable um\nI don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about\nIt it was sort of like when I left my home town it I had a lot of great friendships in great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt it I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up and it was a a predominantly white area I went to like Barry White schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family there was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this as guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true\nThat that might not be and can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what matters finally decided to reach out to them or trying to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write and above my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push\n'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I hadn't become a parent but other times I'm convinced\nThat I Would have eventually search no matter what you know I it's not something I have a firm answer to I'd certainly been curious I wondered um I had gotten a little bit of information that was available to me without making contact or the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names addresses but like general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew sort of what a search would involve\nLike general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew what a search would involve\nUm but it was really my pregnancy that that was the final push I remember sitting at um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birth\n'em and why I was born so prematurely um because I was I was born about ten weeks early and I don't know I had no answer that was actually really scary to be facing my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and childbirth I just\nI don't know something about my ... knowing my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family but I was really scared and also\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like I don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about\nOur family and our history and like what am I going to stay is what I have good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah and I first trimester you know I think\nEvery parent go through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and they can only those questions only become far more acute when there are so many on answered a issues in in the the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm Nicole we've got a lot of callers who want to join us and uh and I just want to get at least a couple of them\nHere to be able

I don't know how long is that unusual no it\nReally isn't I mean there's a lot of shame and guilt and you know really deep emotions and although no one in adoption gets enough support and help and training and and treatment birth parents get the least\nThey just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more Lawson trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption it was something that was going on anyway\nUm so this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children\nUm that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean this this family was a immigrant family and so it it's not something they usually do place children for adoption and they in their situation so I think there are so many pieces to this that are familiar\nAnd difficult and again every story is a case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but it's nickels family story\nAnd Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with\nOn every story about every birth parents but it's the whole family story and Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of your sisters\nDid you know ... we you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is\nDid that process then help uh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family did it get you to the place that you would hope you were hoping to to to go to [noise] I think\nThe primary gaps I was aware of at the time I searched for just simply kind of cats and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or other other factors I certainly cared about [noise]\nUm I cared about ... about my adoption I was curious about my birth family there was a lot I wanted to know and questions I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is one of the reasons I searched but I think it was really from my sister's especially my full sister Cindy from whom I got a lot of information\nUm and she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um\nAnd so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always feel I I I wasn't really part of the family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand all these answers all of a sudden\nI'm I kept my asks pretty simple at first it was like please thought a medical history and\nIf I could ask you some questions I Would like to but if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I were in fact that so but Cindy Cindy was this was her family family the only ones you've got and I think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answers\nAnd that was how I I began to learn more and fill in those gaps in knowledge now\nWell this is obviously an issue that has had an impact on many people's lives 'cause we've got a stack of callers and I just want to let them have their say a little bit more here so let's go to John who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma John you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call um I was raised in the south or in the sixties or seventies Fifteen Years ago a beautiful young man from a ... and my question is is I don't have any experience out or prepare my son for living in a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experience racism John\nYeah I had lived in upper middle class life or when the military where there's very little racism than you know I'm just face those issue yeah\nYeah I had lived in upper middle class lives uh went in the military where there's very little racism than you know I'm just not face those issue yeah how do I prepare my son to go out into the world he no he was very dark he's you know going to face a thing I don't know what to tell him\nJoyce you have an answer for John well I you know they're at the huge question by one of the answers is to make sure you surround yourself with people of color especially you know if he's African American um you know I make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for on models for him\nAnd that you look for help for you uh you know the best people to help you to understand how to deal with racism or people who have experienced it\nAnd so ... and it's also good for him to see you claiming these people who are like him and not just him yeah let's go to Dana who's calling from Glen falls New York then a year on the air\n[noise] Hi I'm I'm a white parent of two Asian um daughters Asian American now uh we began our adoption process about Twenty years ago and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "10"}
