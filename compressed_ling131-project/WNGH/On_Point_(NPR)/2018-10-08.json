gerrymandering and Pennsylvania is adventures in redistricting and really what s\nThe use of WHYY in Pennsylvania because we are talking about gerrymandering and Pennsylvania is adventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact that had on Pennsylvania politics on representation hearing the Keystone State what impact it could have\nAs the discussion about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to the national level I'm doing here today by Lindsey lives our species a multi media journalists were WHYY and also for Keystone crosswords and media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well now Lindsay and Terry uh I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because\nUh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court a and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino did Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and\nYou know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a Lindsey he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen ruin a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he followed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere was nothing that Pennsylvania Constitution which says and not have to be fair whatever fair me to these judges took it upon themselves to say fairness I mean [noise] you know what we think it means and they drew in the process what was the one hand it was called the Democrats dream map\nSo it was a it was just such a [noise] there's just a tape and unconstitutional taking of power by the [noise]\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now lives he lives are ski let me just get a some impressions hear from you because first of all when did Georgia talks about this new map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't actually want to have\nTo do that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out yes and so the timeline here was it was pretty much a crunch so around ... well on January twenty second at the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map\nDeprived Pennsylvania voters of their right to free an equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats votes and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislatures that OK guys you know give us your best shot that didn't happen and we all these uh\nI'm to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislature said OK guys you know give us your best shot\nThat didn't happen and we saw these um these contingencies of different groups handing in math and just this Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now and they were supposed to agree on a new about the could it yes governor was supposed to approve 'em the matter that the legislature um came up with it didn't have that didn't have\nThe first of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders there there was never pass by the general assembly in a form of a law which is what is required\nAnd the Supreme Court and in all fairness to both sides of the Supreme Court did not give the legislature I think adequate time to come up with a map even if the legislature could have come up with a map when when I met ... ... and they went back to\nThis a clause in the constitution known as free in equal yeah which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong or merely suggesting\nThat they went back into a the Eighteenth century for the original constitution to find it\nThere yeah let me ask you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because\nThey saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but but Terry's indicating here that but this was a a novel reading over the ...\nWell I think you also have to look at the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making that decision\nYeah that's exactly right I mean they ... part of it was a political calculation on the part and I'm going into the federal court it could have going on and on and on for a relatively long period of time as it worked its way up to the to the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge off of you know different theory in federal court that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nOkay so there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican uh to uh like balance\nThe next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the but the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now\nAnd that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty somethings seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nYou know the reason why I wanted to come here because I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether you know gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce gerrymandering will we get more moderate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend\nTo to ask that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper\nPolarized politics now but it does tend to ah drowned out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and here's what some voters in the Lehigh Valley told us about what they see what I was\nFor the church and uh there's\nPumpkin pastry and pulled pork on the table at the Chapman quarries United Methodist church\nIt's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidates Marty notes dying a bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled reminding members to keep Jesus at their core\nIn the middle of the road a volunteer has set up a life sized cut out of President Trump\nGiving us arms up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign of a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals the Lehigh Valley was previously split into a wrong lobster shaped district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge\n... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington is old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight point Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point making it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterms\nI liked the valley as a microcosm of the United states we Dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we've always thought about it\nThe dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we throw excited about Rogers\nCalls no Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate won a cycling gold medal at the Sydney Olympics no Stein also advocates for strict term limits\nBut he falls in line with a GOP on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act\nNew stain is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and\nGreet he's not a pie in the sky conservative there's people who are just the idea logs and he was not an ideologue he is a working man\nSo I ask Nicholas question does she think political compromise may be possible in her newly balance district\nYou will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists\nAt

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nFor taking my call\n[noise] um I I'm from a ... eleven district in Pennsylvania just paying is running and um I also helped I also did some volunteer work for a short Scott any a tenth district\nAnd I was\nHappy to see these two districts are now competitive especially the the ... district but um [noise] I'd really like to see Pennsylvanian move further and I stretch and make it more fair mhm\nAnd I really wonder why should this be more of a mathematical model a procedure rather than a political procedure you know start uh start in the top left or the state sort of mathematically work your way through the population and the counties K yeah boundaries or\nIt's a good question Jason and I mean ... even phones issue for a long time what do you think yeah I think you've got a great point there and I'm under the\nIt's a good question Jason and I mean ... even falling this issue for a long time\nWhat do you think yeah I think you've got a great point there and I'm under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling um you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that\nYou know ... a congressional districts me to be ... compact they need to be contiguous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible and that part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria so I think that you know I'm\nGoing forward or the ruling does say that there are these neutral criteria that need to be considered before part is concerned but you know the court didn't go so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a\nDrawing districts becomes too partisan so there's it's vague but there there are some guidelines that the legislature can use going forward but\nI'm Terry Madonna to to the point that the caller was making about you know are there algorithmic ways to get fairness out of out of district outdoors or politics always going to be part of this process\nSo I don't think you can ... I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both trying to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre these models that they now have\nThey can be more skillful added there actually can be better if gerrymandering because of the nature of big they can literally get down to the precinct level\nYou know what I just said knock the district or the ward level the precinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the\nRubble and still is is that the rules for the algorithm and when I was thinking we say computers can do a better let's take another call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThe secretary Michael I live in northern stomach county up to the Akron Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican governor and a Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over in ... northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressmen were were they see and it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our democratic congressman\nYeah the may I may have to go ahead Harry when her to make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in two thousand and ten in the Tea Party\nMay I made a thanks go ahead Harry and\nOn and make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in two thousand and ten and the Tea Party election was not just that the\nRepublicans picked up sixty three house seats or put it another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats\nBut that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does has it's done by law\nBut when you get all these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after state\nThat has a huge difference on writing the laws are each day you know that govern drinking exactly and the actual process itself so the two thousand and ten election\nWas huge not just in terms of the bringing the Tea Party to power the radiological conservatism that it represents\nGo ahead Lindsey yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know they made the laws they made the rules and there was no really check\nCombined the Democrats would do let's look at being nonpartisan about I Know you're not yeah parties and but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there's a district of Maryland yeah so this is not partisan book you already will do that well\nThat's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but you know when Republicans do it uh and uh there have they have done here in\nPennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere people keep talking to me about Marilyn a California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm but the point is is that is there a way to come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to limit let me play for you\nI'm a a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino to Georgia oh he's the riverboat GOP chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just takes he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's\nA a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino to Georgia oh he's the riverboat GOP chairman of Pennsylvania and he basically just take he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um\nAnd he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second\nHe poses other systems to drop future congressional maps and here's what he said\nThat just waiters are in the best position to draw a line than\nThey are today heaven forbid politics should enter into a piece of legislation that draws party political maps done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps or favors and other states like Maryland so you know this is nonsense [noise] this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder\nFair disturbing plan they call it to take back congressional seats and they've done it here in Pennsylvania\nBut failed to Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair ... lives are ski he's ... he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the maps\nBut there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania I just have to say I love that um operatic music behind found in Columbus Day festival in Philadelphia is taking\nMe there to the south Philly um so you know a group a in Pennsylvania fair districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement an independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they've modeled this after California\nAnd um this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs out you see them at events canvassing and you know uh they they ... they're asking the legislators to basically vote against their interests to form this commission", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "08"}
