we're talking this hour about Sears declaring bankruptcy and what it means for retail in America in two thousand Eighteen the once dominant perhaps a V. dominant retailer in the United states for more than a century\nCan't hold on and his going into chapter eleven we're talking this hour with Sarah ... actually the Bloomberg opinion columnist covering the consumer in retail industries\nVicki Howard is also with us She's a business and cultural historian and a professor at the University of ... ethics and author of from main street to mold the rise and fall the American department store\nAnd Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how fears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country you know was that because of uh the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know it's competition was Montgomery Ward it also had a catalog and the late Nineteen century\nUm but I just was a a wave vets um rural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out\nOn real world cars you know across the country and you could order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded I mean as the years as we know it was about was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard warns seniors and a hell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approach business did all that I was allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these ... customers in rural parts of the country\nUm I mean I think the ah they started out as a selling watches so it was just a sort of limited uh from in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with but it really grew later when Julius real civil got on board\nUm and he took the company into it sort of a modern day for us so I I think that this was\nThe gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between rich and the poor and but you know it was a time of industrialization and I'm also movement into cities\nAnd a growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also um\nThe growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also a lot of access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it other otherwise they would have had to you know travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so it really was about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street an entrepreneur um sort of\nGoing to small towns across the country then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nWas Sarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets in opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and as as Vicky how are just saying also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in Seoul mini malls in America\nYeah I think in some ways the story is yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still rural and agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the patterns in shopping patterns on and making that adaptation so quickly\nI mean you think about that they didn't start stores still Nineteen twenty five and I believe\nA within a decade stores were the majority of their business compared to ah\nThe catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and the speed with which it even able to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think fears occupies such an important place in retailing history in Congress and\nSo we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with the Sears or ... years perhaps at least once in their lives so lots of lots of memories you go to Deborah who's calling from Watertown, Connecticut Deborah you're on the air\nYes making great show I I'm I have worked for two great American institutions feared and prudential 'em and potential continues to thrive and fears of course is not\nI started my fears when I was a kid during the Vietnam War um my father was a military sergeant stationed in Japan so we ordered everything that we needed I Would ...\nIt during the Vietnam War um my father was military surgeon stationed in Japan so we ordered everything that we needed\nI Would pour over it for hours [noise]\nUm I think fear is has been off to fight and heading for trouble for a long time I worked for years in the Nineteen seventies when I was in high school and housewares [laughter] I'm the guy I worked for his name was John man I Hope his kids here this\nHe was the top housewares manager and the entire country he was very innovative very successful very aggressive\nHe he was a bear about knowing the merchandise yeah send me on spying missions to see what other stores were charging so he could set prices in sales based on that information he had made cooking chicken and ham inside the store grilling it\nSo that the smell would attract customers who might not be thinking about\nI Love to see sounds like a really creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never ever ever got promoted beyond manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high school I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that and and you know\nAnd I especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those\nDays about I'm an old style manager here I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with a customer who wanted to order replacement parts for his Webber grill which was not hard\nBut he was really really difficult and really unhappy and hard to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy was that his wife had left him\nAnd she had um [noise]\nTaken the parts but not the grill uh-huh and and I and I didn't I couldn't handle and when I finally said to him excuse me sir it's not my fault that your wife left you and I hung up on it and he\nCalled the store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store manager who we never saw on the floor who was a you know young man college educated wars suit\nCame down to you know get my head on a platter and drawn stuck up for me uh-huh he said she shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a good worker and then he sat me down and he gave me you know the costs yeah always right lecture but he's stuck up for me\nDebra thank you so much for your call and for your memories there and and a really wonderful example about or perhaps hope more qualified

what that means for this major American retailer it's been a retailer at the heart of American Life for more than a hundred years and ah what that means for retail as we move forward in the digital age\nI mean let's listen here to a clip from a Sears ad from the Nineteen nineties featuring Bob Vila home improvement television host also a Sears commercials spokesperson talking about all the things you could accomplish with your products\nRemodeling a kitchen or bathroom such a big job\nWhen you try to do it all and do it right\nHi, Bob Vila procedures and the home improvement professionals maybe you've been dreaming about a beautiful new kitchen more updating your bad well if it's too big a job to do yourself trust the job to seniors they've been in business for over a hundred years\nBob Vila there in the Nineteen nineties wanting spheres long history in the retail business you've got comments coming in on our website a debit says Sears was our parents and our parents parents store when I think as the years I think of craftsmen Kenmore\nThe only two brand I ever bought their they're still manufactured and can be bought elsewhere uh so that's a comment from our website on point radio dot org let's go to Dave who's calling from Buffalo New York Dave you're on the air [noise]\nAre you doing doing great day what's your thoughts are taking my call yeah go ahead [noise]\nYeah you know I said I'm a I'm a current shares of [noise] um I'm a service technician and you know what I'm we're just getting bigger and bigger\nWe're not actually attached to it or what uh-huh shares is always going to be there and they explained it to us if you think of it this way\nSit or dog outlet uh-huh fears is always going to be there as they explained it to us if you think of it this way\nIt's going full circle here's is you're one of the catalogue company like apple I looked for them to you guys talk for a very interesting and you know Sears catalog company and then they started having spores more and more everywhere\nSo that now that the the digital age is here in the millennials by everything on line just about and I'm I'm a father than kids and I and I've been with fears over Twenty years yeah you're on a great place for war\nAnd I read and I'm going full circle\nSo ... so they can just jump in here for like do you mean first full circle what do you mean by that 'cause if you say your service technician in ... your your business is is is as busy as ever\nUm yeah you don't have your you know what we're um Sears and the factory service or are they in the center for appliance or electronic [noise] because\nWe do other I'm like we do\nUm flows Home Depot or ... um that's why we\nDo all the service I see the wrong it was all the store\nYou know wherever wherever appliances sold redo the orange juice or Steve\nI'm going to take it back from your thank you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a Bloomberg opinion columnist Dave said he's feeling confident lease for his part of Syria's business and he's he's the company's coming full circle what do you think so I think there's\nSomething to the fact that the services area is if if you had to call out some bright spots at Sears services would be one\nThat's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on daddy you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances with than because uh they have this relationship with you via their services business so there is something to that but this idea than coming full circle\nI think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business\nFor that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and\nLook at the labor's been saying for years this year's is going to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened they keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years\nGoing to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened they keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of profit loss okay so since you mentioned\nE commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line it is it actually might be less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done online and certainly I it it varies a lot I category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent and categories like apparel is probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTwenty or thirty percent in apparent okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in brick and mortar store Sears couldn't capitalize on that are having problems doing\nExactly and I think that's why yes this is definitely a story as Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story of Sears getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterparts\nAh we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's a those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears a best buy stock in your all time high that it as it has staged a remarkable turnaround it has taken share from Sears and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption there has been from off stores like T. J. max\nAnd Ross which had been on a tear in recent years and taking share away from traditional department stores like seers\nWell let's go to John is calling from Detroit Michigan John you're on the air\nThank you so I buy my first grass Minnesota to back when I was a teenager in the seventies and out and you know no pun intended guy or a serious person um and then when I got involved in the communities of Detroit I found out that there is actually catalog houses\nAll right down the street from me that were built in their forties that were purchased right out of the catalog unfortunately a Sears is kind of waned on the Saturday Detroit or the last Twenty years and it's probably been ten years since I've been in the ... because\nAh they just don't like they used to\nYeah well John thank you for your call Vicky how are you the the business and cultural historian John reminding us that you could ... there was a time you could buy a house out of a Sears catalog\nYeah I think I might have lived in one myself uh from the Nineteen twenties I'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're they're lovely home a and I'm ... I think that they had this\nI'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're they're lovely homes and um it I think that they had their special special catalog devoted to to them that closed\nDown I think right around the Nineteen forties I Believe on but you know you can see homes from the turn of the century Nineteen twenties in any community in the U.S and he might possibly be able to identify them as a serious home\nYeah well so they can hurt a minute ago a Sarah ... talked about how uh in two thousand Eighteen\nYes e commerce is huge and getting bigger but we're still doing Ninety percent of our shopping in brick and mortar stores and I mean you've written about the rise and fall of the American department store so so why is there and the seeming disconnect between how much we shop and where we shop and why some department stores in the years among them are having trouble hanging on\nI mean we haven't really talked much about Wal Mart and Amazon is\nSort of taking over our in our thoughts of you know as the as the big competitor for these brick and mortar stores but you know when I was writing my book I I thought mostly about Wal Mart as as a competitor for the traditional department store um and you know Sears use to occupy a space\nThat Wal Mart to um uh uh now does a as the largest retailer in the country a Wal Mart be overtook the ears and I'm In the early Nineteen nineties\nSo I think that it Sears needs to be seen ... answer that longer um trajectory of it Sarah a signal or her early comments that ... what happened to Sears not just about the last few years it's about sort of a long term trend I'm going back to the Nineteen eighties\nAnd it it's it's it isn't inevitable um I I Do believe that um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "17"}
