P. way right which was really human centric really employ centric it was a great place to work and to stay\nUm ... Packard right Sheila Packard and then ... and David Packard right they had a whole management theory about management by walking around they handed a profit share\nQuite a bit with their employees I mean it was it was the standard of an end looking would turn into a blue chip companies right no longer but [laughter] but it was at the top of the heap once the garage that that ... founded HP is a national landmark\nRight and and they the one thing I I loved about uh two they would have a big picnic for the whole company once a year\nAnd your family's in there and they view the company as a family and they the two of them would serve all the hamburgers you know they would sort of certain people are sort of symbolic but but you know there's a certain humility to it and they wanted people to stay for their entire careers they bought\nLand for employees to go camping in or a you know for recreation in different parts of the world where they had officers\nThat were really much a very much about the people in their country then the next wave in the seventies and eighties you had to sort of counter cultural way we have like the jobs in Wozniak kind of thing and when I came into covering tech\nIn the late eighties it was still kind of hippy ... be counter cultural pro people was a great place to work if you landed a job and one of these places like oh\nFantastic and that\nHas radically changed and that's no longer you know\nThat kind of place it's it's very stressful\nYeah well then you can just can jump in here saying 'cause we've got a caller who was who's talking exactly this about um the value of the employees are in this day and age so let me just look get his say here Robert is calling from Omaha Nebraska Robert you're on the air\n\nAnd it was saying that the employers ... an electric when you're a transactional issue can be turned on the news on but it's not your start and there's nothing it's nothing new we're just returning back before\nIn terms of ... as you can be turned on the news fine but it's not your start and there's nothing there's nothing new or just returned to for the capitalism it's silly things are Alicia ...\nRobert thank you so much for your call a deadlines what do you think about that means he's kind of thing when I said earlier that a lot of this sounds really familiar\n[noise] it it it does in a way I'm\n... I went back in ...

E. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nUm point I'm making took her body we're talking this hour with dandelions he's author of a new book lab rats how Silicon Valley may work miserable for the rest of us and also joining us today from San Francisco is an NEA Williams she's cofounder and zebras unite an organization that's calling for more ethical and inclusive start up and venture capital\nCulture where one eight hundred for two three eight to five find this eight hundred for it to three talk in India and dance so many comments coming in on line here we have for example toy Yoda is saying that\nIn my experience what makes a little work life miserable isn't Google but the dogma of work flow innovation that the software industry keeps inventing a let's see a sea says I've seen a slightly positive change in that we're moving towards more open Cuban collaborative workspaces but not much else\nYet a and Victoria Morrison on Twitter is saying real dandelions is making a good point here I Know some posts millennials and young people who reject current tax culture will they reinvented or find another way to make a living\nLet's go to Steve who's calling from Boston, Massachusetts Steve you're on the air\nA guy that I have to take issue with some of the things that are your perspective and I'll give you my own my own background I worked here for ten years until a a good portion of that time I was actually working in the VCR investing and companies in Israel\nAnd then I left in ... and the uh I work in our during your what your caller safari\nSilicon are so expensive so far as in Israel or the people around the world and showing them what's going on in Israel and my my you're\nMy perspective is is that most of the companies are on the coach was in my experience when I was doing some interesting was that the best companies who are most successful companies were the ones who really put the emphasis\nIt's been my experience when I was there were some interesting was that the best companies are most successful companies were the ones who really put the emphasis\nOn the employees because basically the start of culture the culture is grounded in a knowledge in your brain power bringing your version of bringing your idea of\nThe human capital ... yeah\nAnd that's when capital and want to invest him out the best ones do invested it do well in my experience is is that the people who are working in those environments are energized an incentive are compensated and enjoy it and feel it seemed like a contribution\nWill Steve thank you so much for your call let's get dance response you\nKnow I I think ... completely in agreement I think there are there are companies doing that and and those people are happy [noise] um [noise] um but let's say ... I mean the everything that came out and we were in the last couple of years is not like that right route Amazon warehouses are not like that um\n... when he mentioned I'm working in Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple of years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he\nOffered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in his company\nAnd I'm a true story and I thought it like what do we come in and even the BCS I call to that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise]\nAnyway but yeah there are there is a lot of just hoping stuff out\nThere [laughter] yeah well any of them let me just ask you briefly a are we ... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we\n... are we over waiting the influence of these like the ultra big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's ... he was saying that he's not obviously not every company is going this way is is are there actually maybe medium or a smaller size or come the tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on instead\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and you know we have a lot I\nUm and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and\nYou know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the bitter with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much but at the same time productivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and out of\nIt isn't as I Do because I mean because we knowledge where it could be asset is the worker writings that not workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of the standard way of looking at labor is that's that's delivered that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down was quickly in order to\nA massage a profit for that quarter I just cut a workforce they go to make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets of a company or the workers themselves so\nMy question is new to you India is that in trying to shift perspective a little here um for for these tech companies or for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers are empowered them more of that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing\nI think it has to has to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and intention ... kind of the two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male champ as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps so they never raised any venture capital\nThey're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that work there I Know that they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so\nI think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally or how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing start ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures\nTo me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing start ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be\nYou know how radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share it's a private company um but they share a all of their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nUh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they want it to be able to build it more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that they are the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there for\n'em and then I'd also say like again to companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of a more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate and the success of that company as well so everyone is invested in this excessive and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top I think there's a lot to be said about having those\nMore flexible schedules and um you know enabling remote work I Know from my team or or just a multiple teams because they run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the deliverable is and we plan those together for oh it's a route okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by this time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you want to go to the movies for the entire day and maybe you only work three days out of the week like such as long as they were like yeah it's a gold on how you get out of your life now no uh there are a lot more calls you want to get to hear but then one quick thought from you and what you're hearing from India", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "25"}
