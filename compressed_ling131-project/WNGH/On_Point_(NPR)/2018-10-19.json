Seventeen year old senior at Ken would academy she's a member an organizer with good kids mad city an advocacy organization that includes young people from Baltimore in Chicago who are working to end violence in their cities Alicia welcome down point\nHi David thank you for having me and joining us from New York is dimitrius Howard Hughes a Seventeen year old senior at Washington Heights

transformation Milwaukee a nonprofit organization led by use of color\nOr that organizes young people around issues related to political power and social racial and economic justice\n... welcome Don point\nHi David thank you for having\nCare first let's start with you a a George ... is from Milwaukee himself but what struck you about ah our conversation today\nUm I think one of the biggest thing that struck me was talking about star code switching and I find that often for me because I Do I Do live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and I go to a like if I didn't go out here in Franklin Wisconsin\nSo can we just take a moment and I'd like to unpack that a bit for those folks who might not know about code switching is basically as a as I as I understand it you know basically switching how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\nWell um so I went to in the air or not in the at the school and walking because that's where I live but when I started a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame than me going from\nBeing around people who look and talk just like me now coming here to people who look completely different things and had different lingo and different things than I have so I remember it\nAnd then here people who look completely different and had different lingo and different things than I have\nSo I remembered my freshman year I Would still talk like normal or I was ill you started playing and people would not understand what I meant by saying words or I Would feel different for talking less proper than they did so I kinda get\nStarted teaching myself that when I met or I taught property values proper English and when I go home I'm able to talk how I feel comfortable talking and you dislike that my family and friends I used to\nYou know there's a scene in the movie a that goes that speaks directly to that a store Carter is played by the actor amend western bird uh she lives to live she shuttling between garden heights are poor and mostly black neighborhood and Williamson which is an affluent mostly white a private prep school did she attends\nA in this scene as I start enters William since she explains that she also shuttles between two ... two different persona is\nIn the world\nI got to keep it separate so when I'm here I'm Sorry version to\nThat means slipping a switch in my brain\nWilling to die doesn't use like if a rapper with they she doesn't\nEven for my friends to\nThing makes me you know those kids\nHave faith can tell you is that what you're talking about\nYesterday that the what I'm referring to\nI Wonder ... you know did you read uh uh uh the book as well if I'm not mistaken are these things that kind of play out in your own life where you you have to think about how you handle yourself because of the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in a suburban I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how\nEverybody speaks them now you have to act as like completely different and so because of the areas where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because um\nIt's like you because you are\nBlack saying these words and acting like this makes you appear as it makes you appear as less educated than somebody else so when you're around these people even though we don't like intentionally mean to do it just kind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that\nAnd so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth\nPatiently mean to do it it just kind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that and so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both of my mostly white communities and mostly populated with well actually these the way I spoke to the way I talked with address the way I act it was completely different\nSide that's the way you can relate to the idea of code switching\nOver how much like how much of an extra burden is that walking around to having to St consciously about how you present yourself or is that kind of similar to you know how teenagers have to figure out who they are going to be anyway\nUm I think it's definitely an extra burden that we have because for black people it's this idea of a double identity there'll be always have to face this now [noise]\nDimitrius you want to go in there for ... no I'm Sorry okay go ahead ... to\nA library and nice\nI um I definitely think that\nIt's way more harder for black person to find themselves because we're always face was having to fight so many negative stereotypes that's already approaching this is the first place so I think if you're somebody who doesn't grow up\nBeing educated on history of our people and learn about how to really truly love yourself for being black and you're kind of just growing up in a world where if you're not hearing these things but you're hearing by people aren't educated they missed their that their ... their own everywhere and blah blah blah blah blah it's kind of like\nSo what do I have to conform I substitute it seemed like I can make it so I think code switching is definitely a burden for a lot of black people because it's especially a lot of young black people because we're not fully aware of ourselves yet and civil or face on trying to be ourselves but then also\nFace on trying to please others it does become an extra burden because most other people won't have to go through that because they're already\nThe idea of perfection other people's eyes what we are\nTo be trusted you have a different take on that um\nI agree on that one Minnesota situations like when I have like a job interview or something oh put on a voice like not to be like a pill like a white voice ... but um\nTo get back on back to me that\nIs true of course I actually ... what I did want to ask you about a little bit was you know we heard from a maverick who's the father of a stark harder in the opening scene about how important was to be proud of being black and at the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young ...\nIn the opening scene about how important was to be proud of being black in at the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young black kids are boys and girls needed to handle themselves when they were dealing with law enforcement officials three trees to receive a version of the talk like that\nUm yes ah received a talk like that when I was younger\nSo how does lay out what was that like\nIt was this one night when me and my father was like in the kitchen token\nThey were just talking about driving his stuff and we got to the topic about police when we get pulled over and a resort of all they want to cause pull over like he always put his hands on the steering wheel Antonio I get older and like so get a license to do that\nAnd like a few months back that happen like the cuts photos over and my father put his hands on his third wheel so I've had my hands on dash or two it was kind of nervous 'cause like the videos administering it saying lately on

Michael you're on the air\nYes sir um first of all hello and thanks for taking my call Yes sir I'm\nI'll get I'll give credit and and praised to let you for doing what they're doing but I'm a fifty year old black bad and there's nothing on America and I don't think it a ... matter of fact they seemed like it got worse since the seventies to be honest with\nYou what's gotten worse and Michael\n... the the racial profiling and the tension between races I mean look we got we got Donald Trump elected that the the the attitude and the mentality of\nWhere the state of mind and you know the police force was created to keep the Jim Crow laws and check and everything and that mentality and psychological profile if they're on the fourth today\nThank you so much for your perspective Michael I appreciate it very much dimitrius downward you focused a lot in your group as I understand it on thinking about how to de escalate tensions with police there's there's a line in in the movie where star Carter's a uncle who's on the police force basically\nHe's in her corner but a certain point he says to you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that\nA uncle who's on the police force basically ... he's in her corner but a certain point he says to you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that how do you approach thinking about uh how how you deal with police are in this day and age and and the challenges they face as well as the the challenges that that you might face\nUm I think there's a respect we need to respect for both both sides um\nWhen I was Thirteen I had a\nExperience would stop and frisk and I'd like to have a lot of fear and the next two years I always had like fair for police can you tell me about\n... meters can you tell me a little bit about what that incident with like oh it was like what happened\nIt was scary I was walking around my block al going built into building trying to find a friend and then do it like these two policemen and following me so I started like kind of walking fast because that was kinda scary and um they called me around the corner and they start to check my ankle to see if I had drugs or anything and\nI had twenty dollars because at my parents and having to pockets and I was just shaking the whole time and they say while you're scared I was like\nThis never happened to me before so the next few years every time I caught like Cruz by me always like shake up\nThey'll do yeah I mean it you know look I live in New York and a half for a while and and it's been part of the the background of New York is that this this debate on a policy level of ... you know among people who make policies and laws about stop and frisk\n... you know is about this issue but it kinda takes away from the human element right like this is your acted not only your night but but how you thought about yourself out in public\nYes and um I think I have a solution for that uh-huh I think there should be like police officers\nAnd the same neighborhood for ... years circus I growing relationships with them and just not have a new police or say every month or week\nLike we should start growing relationships because I noticed one police officer and he has the same idea and we're like we have a conversation sometimes and think that that should happen they ship place police officers and the same neighborhood\nThere had been efforts to do that but it sounds as though it has an a you know taken root in a way that's been meaningful for you and your neighborhood nutritious there\nYou know there was an exclusive interview today that good morning America had with a Jeremiah Harvey he's a nine year old who is a falsely accused of sexual assault or I Believe in Brooklyn New York uh when his backpack brushed up against a woman in the corner store at the woman Theresa Klein is white she called the police and has since apologized\nUh I Believe in Brooklyn New York when his backpack brushed up against a woman in a corner store or the woman Theresa Klein is white she called the police and has since apologized but Jeremiah and his mother told good morning America that lake like dimitrius they can't shake the incident\nSo hard because I played the online lines\nI think it's not all but says oh you\nAre you concerned that this has permanently scarred Jeremiah yes I certainly\nIt was devastating for him because even after walking away he was pointing to\nPatrol cars on Flatbush Avenue and saying mommy are they he had to take you away from us\nCaroline's how much uh uh is this idea of living wall black uh uh uh we've heard instances where a man was stopped from entering his own home or apartment building in St Louis because a white resident there didn't trust him although he lived there as well how much does this affect kind of your your daily rhythms of your life\nI think it affects me heavily because it it creates this constant fear that you walk around and you carry it creates when you when you drive you look out of your when you see a police officer here and even though you're doing everything right you immediately think what am I doing wrong\nAnd I'm just to add on listening to the video and the incident with the little boy aid very much reminding me of the situation with and the two\nAnd how that affected him he and the tail had no idea what he had done wrong and not at the little boy that it just happened to and\nThey now he feels as if he did something wrong he feels as if he made a mistake or that you know something bad is going to happen to him at such a young age and now he's going to grow up and had that carrying around him so did\nGrowing up black and living up living in this type of situation create a constant\nUm amount of fear on you and a constant amount of worry anxiety and she got to carry around because you never know what it's going to happen or what a smart move it's going to um how ... going to affect you it affect your life in the long run itself\nIn the movie the heat you give start ... as I said earlier played by among Lester starting bird is a ... attends a mostly white school called Williamson prep a after her friend ... killed in a traffic stop by a police officer some students take the opportunity to ditch school and too\nMostly white school called Williamson prep after her friend ... killed in a traffic stop by a police officer some students take the opportunity to school and to go to a protest in this clip that we'll hear star reviews for friend Haley who's played by Sabrina Carpenter\nI just don't know who you're wasting as we get close to help our it's not just class it's a good cause\nReally don't want to hear my teacher said that I knew\nYour school how would you guys called book talk on the heat you give up what kinds of conversations are problems with your white classmates that spark any any new thoughts\nUm actually I had to up to one of my freshman year and then one maybe last week the first one that I had with my freshman class actually did start the conversation about what happened but it wasn't a I'm a growing conversation and it was more so like my teacher talking and then\nPeople just kind of like one of the conversation to be over\nAnd then the one that I recently had um last week was out of the same thing so none of them really sparked the major conversations um\nBased on what my teacher said to my classmates responding it just kind of made it awkward for me on my end because I noticed that as she was reading the book and talking about the situation everybody was kind of looking at me because I'm the only black student in the class\nAnd I'm In my school I Know and for talking about\nActivism and police brutality so it just kind of both times kind of gave everyone kind of gave me the ... and it didn't really bring up any heavy conversation so", "year": "2018",
