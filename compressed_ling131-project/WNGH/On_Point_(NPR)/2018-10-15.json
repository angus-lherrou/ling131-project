Bush spelled out his vision for advancing freedom globally through American foreign policy\nSo it is a policy of the United states [noise]\nTo seek and support the growth of democratic movements\nAnd institutions in every nation\nWith the ultimate goal of ending tyranny and our world [noise]\nTo a different people from two different parties here a spouse ... roughly the same idea but you call this policy failure right why\nWell there's lots of different reasons the easiest way to see this is look at the world we had in Nineteen Ninety three were restricted everything was going to go swimmingly and the world we're in today are back in Nineteen Ninety three of the United states is on good terms with all the major powers including Russia and China\nA democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first Gulf War\nOr the Oslo peace process is underway uh so we're thinking that maybe we're going to get you know peace in the middle east as well just stored Mary optimism\nThere now fast forward to twenty eight team um the relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War or there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most\nUm the relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War or there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most people believe the two state solution that the United states has actively promoted\nIs farther away than ever Iran had added a as many as Nineteen thousand centrifuges before fight signing the nuclear deal but they're essentially a a late nuclear power and oh ah India Pakistan in North Korea has tested nuclear weapons\nAnd finally democracy is in retreat in lots of different places a Freedom House are reported last year that was the twelfth consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush saying that that's our goal right to end tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one final point um the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nSo it seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the cost we've seen in a variety of different places\nAnd without a doubt but are you saying that uh for example the retreat of democracy of ... worldwide is it that it can be the that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well but for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places ah Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding in hungry backsliding in Poland a suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transformed the middle east at the\nAt the point of a rifle barrel in fact have clearly failed\nA you know had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three would not have gotten ISIS um the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi led into a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better\nAnd by the way for all of this is going on\nThen countries like Russia and China in Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not are really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nAll one reaction is you seize Crimea to stop the Ukraine\nFull democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us all one reaction is you seize Crimea to stop in Ukraine from moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable one in terms of his ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places\nSo one of the questions that you that you explore in the book the key question is how this notion of the primacy of the U. S. project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nI mean we can we went through some of the examples but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duty that America had to the world being as guiding light for democracy ah but you say that there's an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps\nThat idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite you're talking\nAbout well it's a a broad a group of set of people uh I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob\nIn Washington that's essentially who I'm Talking about but we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy to Defense Department intelligence services State Department so they are part of this\nOf this whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that\nFrightened comment on foreign issues on a pretty much a daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and often go to Washington to work so that's who I'm Talking about\nUm and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the ... this idea that the United states first of all has to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals and there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines in favor of it\nIdeals and there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nIn favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three\nUm you see that in the fact that people can circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable to some degree and finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotations you've been a playing here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals but\nAs I Want to get to him in in a second about how you if you see this foreign policy elite is on accountable but but Iraq is it the disaster of the Iraq War is isn't\nIt it's an interesting moment to discuss here because I Want to dive into that a little bit\nBecause you know you said that the majority of Democrats supported the Iraq War but I wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people as a war for the security of national security of the United states I mean that's part of what you say here that the foreign policy elite as\nThings considered CPB bandwidth affairs [laughter]\nSupport for ... comes from generous listeners like you in this fast paced world you want to have access to news when you need it check out our Web site at gp news dot org we've got the latest state national and international news available twenty four seven\nBut they're also in depth feature stories from across the state of Georgia you can also view video performances from great musicians in our gp music present series\nFor information and entertainment you can count on gp the news ... news dot org\nI'm Peter O'Dowd from market to elections and technology we rely on poor casts about the future how good are we making predictions big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else\nThey don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records that next time around here in the mood to do today Yun G.

professor ... lots of comments coming here let me just read a couple of them to you on Twitter pole moves or us is saying\nQuestioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise\nI says Noam Chomsky debunk this and wall should counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing\nA David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion is the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera have been used as a stalking horse for American corporate had Gemini which is highly questionable democratizing influence uh just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all Stephen Walt\n... sympathetic to both comments I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very carefully heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states has favor to ah you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations not all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had a particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually\nDon't benefit corporations would all go back to the uh Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton and oil services corporation to do business with Iraq or do do business with Iran\nCheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning both\nOf them and then that very same person ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts there\nThat's right yeah I'm a ... and finally uh I I think the United states does\nHalliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts\nThere that's right now I'm a ... and finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something\nPurely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things and things like that [noise]\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a that his ... that has driven certainly the intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings\nIn Benghazi and the desire to end now at that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger\nThan that so I'm just a follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now are just some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYou know there's no question and and if you look I think at the role of\nUm the military what do you know Eisenhower recalls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks organizations who know not surprisingly then want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money\n[noise] alright well lots of ... at least get a couple of them in here Mitch is calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nHi thanks so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think are under under current president um who is an amoral agent uh mostly concerned what well I worry that are American values\nAre going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and uh the uh journalists a highlight this conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are our our values for sale\nThank you for your call Steve along well in some respects I think ah our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a a sense of trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and learned to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well with our national security or others [noise]\nUh and we have always sort of wrestled with a which of these\nOr wanted to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well whether a national security or others and we have always sort of wrestled with a which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to win out\nOf most of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a Saudi journalist ... ... and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it\nPresident Trump has been waffling it seems to me on this one uh that his initial statements were were quite forgiving he seems to be in typical Trump being fashion kicking up a sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it\nUm [noise] so I think you know the the concern the caller has is exactly right here in at ... I think one of the larger issues with President Trump is his inability to separate out some of his own personal interest and possibly personal financial interests from the broader interest of the country\nWell so let's talk more about the Trump administrative now because you open your book saying that um then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of\nHis view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so so let's just remind folks what what the president then candidate Trump said when he critiqued the status quo of U.S foreign policy here he is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nUnfortunately after the cold or a foreign policy veered badly oh of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nThe logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming\nThat's Donald Trump on April two thousand sixteen now Stephen Walt we could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions the president has made since then I mean but about the Paris climate accord about or his a disc discussions with North Korea about the Iran nuclear program but I really want to focus on Syria here for for a moment because\nUh you know we just heard the president twenty sixteen saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security advisor\nScenes saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security adviser John Bolton\nTalking about expanding the American mission in Syria beyond the Syrian civil war and to containment of Iran for as long as Iranian forces are in Syria or Iranian backed militias are anywhere in the region\nA so here's national security visor Bolton again issuing a stern warning to Iran a at a group called a United against nuclear on summit last month\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens\nIf you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed the hell to pay\nThe John Bolton there a Steven will not necessarily talking about a democratizing force but a an expansion of the U.S military mission in Syria so is that is the Trump Administration being pulled by the same a foreign policy forces that we've been talking about this hour\nUm I think in the twenty sixteen campaign Trump food's not sophisticated thinker on these things but he did in to it ah that something had gone badly wrong with U.S foreign policy and that resonated with the American people are when he said you know American foreign policy is complete and total disaster a lot of people out of their heads in agreement\nAnd that was especially effective against Hillary because she could out or tried to tell her foreign policy credentials but I think what you've seen is all a since Trump became president although his style his approach to the presidency and has\nA public style of handling diplomacy whether it's by Twitter or by his personal interactions with other leaders is completely different and I think we're remarkably counterproductive", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "15"}
