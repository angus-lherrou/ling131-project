I think it's just spray sure\nOkay well so let's see how far the inspiration goes ...

I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's how do you need to kind of get into that mode focus okay we're into this you know however long it's gonna be just break it down into the daily tasks and\nI she found ... ... you get so busy surviving you know use these job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how easy it is as a lone survivor to look up to yourself and again you know when we're now is the crew you know when we were filming stuff\nEverything is so much easier when you have an extra set of has to be needed you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else to be needed just to put a social not what you'd do you know the ...\n... everything on your on December ... but it's all so busy you know I just remember that see a training I went through to the days on All right it was just doing to a doctor and the sea collected firewood repairing the setting snag\nThat but it's all so busy you know I just remember that save training I went through to the days on our own and it was just doing to the doctor and they see collecting firewood repairing this setting snake as doing that and by the end is ... yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beat you got to keep thinking like you know\nI always say to people and it's survival situation is never letting your mind going to neutral is always something to be doing to think about the planning and um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on your own I I think it's three times higher than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere is one of the thing that Steven said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from me 'cause I actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was man and he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was thinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on TV released survived survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly mace to spending three hours trying to lie to five ... and the reality of a sudden in the old days on the ...\nYou know I spent hours and hours during the ... hours and hours studying ... obviously that she was going to make a Rudy boring program\nYou know I guess edited ... bit of music and ... book has got a guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just as his wife said rotted as to the show survivor of summed up three was never give up or what about that too nasty that spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple ... hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why\nThe rules to we've got to that do get that determine you know nest Saturday to\nThe British and the brave the strongest well so let's do a lightning round a quick quick right here for by the way to wrap it for\nThe people that's got to be no one day he loves food team found in the ... yeah I I end up seeing is Seventy says we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave them nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFilm everything themselves that you know we come back a month later and it's like ... flights\nFrom this desert island to leave the nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFilm everything themselves that you know we come back a month later and it's like counted showing that they like stream white law said and that is the reality of survival is yes you're starving you de hydrated you're frightened you wet your cold and ... and\nYou know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous it's right on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nWell speaking of the the glamorous part of survival I Do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answer so we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation survival situation how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why couldn't it be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind test track needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] [laughter] I mean they really don't care about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff you know so\nI'm On the whole ... you're not getting the ... by the failures then you next time I go back to ... to ... that one again\nAll right so get Matt wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingest poisonous plan for animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be super caffeine in the ... make big mistakes once and when it comes to you know poison things I've funky mushrooms and then ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt darn each it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms\nYou know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas like so many things okay and then you know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one side great film editor Wyoming the Alaska decided in the ... you know he had a baby on the ... hour on TALK ran to get it wrong ones out there\nAnd by the way if you have from folks have already Jon Krakauer original book is amazing Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\nHey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survive as enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress civic uh things you can snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so the Bible is all about that in space\nEight but actually in the middle of an actress of a good thing she's going to snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so survived is all about that in the spirit the outer muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on our team who ... you know it's such an inspirational survivalists so they are living examples to survive is all about spirit and ... to nasty impulsivity [noise]\nUm and actually some of them have the guns the guy with the you know [laughter] or that who was impressive to see as well\nAll right one more a lightning round here question Sam Wednesday and on Twitter or sorry on our website says beer can you do your classic ... like when you accomplish a big Clyde thanks that's from Sam\nCome on let me give out team were on it we're moving on a ski guys they pose a stiff protein in we can do to it\nThan grills and his class thing how let's go to Mars Selena who's calling from Dayton, Ohio you're on the air marshal Ina\nMorning thank you for taking my call my question for Barry is I I I read somewhere if you live in the what you can't or is any part of a pine tree\nIt's high income you know drink the water from the early part but I Can't find the information to know what that is true or not\nThat is true that the pine tree is one of the unsung heroes of the wild and there's so much you can do everything you mentioned but also more you know the old days they used to use the reds and mix it with a charcoal from afar make glue outta that\nA United patch of canoes or to stem ... uh there's so much to do I spend a lot of time is moving through forests just
