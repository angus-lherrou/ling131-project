hit that you took on the tire test into in twenty twelve or in Kansas\nAnd I want to play a little bit of sound of releasing this very significant race it happened not long after that at Talladega this is kind of the book came to the the big hits that you took\nThat scared me straight as you were saying I'm a little bit earlier so first of all let's listen to what happened in the last lap of the good Sam roadside assistance four hundred at the Talladega super speedway\nIn Alabama I'm there was a huge pack of cars there are in that last lap and here's what happened [noise]\nIn that last lap the cars are basically for deep they're going at two hundred miles an hour or if you haven't seen it or you don't remember it it's on YouTube and it is breathtaking to watch\nThe here's Dale Earnhardt junior over the radio conversation with his crew chief Steve tart right after just moments after that Talladega crash everybody [noise]\n[noise]\nWell to deal tell us about that moment because I think it was after that are and how you felt after that that's what took you to go get help yeah so this was four weeks after the Kansas crash that had it been so Mm So terrible for me\nAnd I had been suffering with the symptoms for those four weeks and I finally started to feel like my old self again coming into Talladega that weekend so there was a big big sense of relief for me but there was also\nA sense of fear because at Talladega they have these big PACs cars and when there are those type of crashes as they're they're impossible to skate so I knew ...\n[noise] a sense of fear because at Talladega they have these big PACs our cars and when there are those type of crashes is they're they're impossible to skate so I knew the chances of me being involved in another accident were very high for that particular weekend\nSo I was very nervous about that all I wanted was just to be able to get through that race clean with no problems and I felt like I'd be home free and um get I got involved in that crash in ... and during a crash cart tee ball on the side of the car and spun the car around and I immediately\nWent all the way back to having the symptoms that I had before and maybe even worse and so\nBut this was a different kind of injury the right because we're like which around yeah so the ... this was instead of an impact you know direct impact this was a very quick fast spin [noise]\nAnd so I knew immediately something was wrong with me again and I was really angry about it a and very emotional a unusually emotional for some reason and you can hear that in the in radio\nCommunication and uh that's something I typically probably wouldn't be having that I wouldn't be really having that personal of a conversation over that radio because it's something that the entire team in ... all the fans can here and have access to [noise]\nUm but in those moments when you're injured and you're not really in control your emotions and ... and all those things and so\nUm\nI ... I knew that through my third reading about concussions and hearing these stories so over the past five years you know there's just been so much coverage of concussions whether it's NFL players or what have you\nUh retired players are just so much content out there so many stories and I can't\n[noise] um I couldn't help myself from sort of absorbing some of that and and it frightened me you know so when I was and I learned and read about layering layering concussions together and having concussions very close together in a very short period of time and\nSo here I Am and I'm thinking man I'm really playing with fire I better take this seriously this could be something you know these these issues could become permanent that would be a awful to have to wake up every day with something\nUm changed about you and something couldn't correct well can I just I've been here for ... ... the ...\n[noise] um changed about you and some deep couldn't correct well\nCan I just jump in here for a second 'cause ... the you really you write about in the book about how right after that that crashed that did that second hit at Talladega as you were saying like you were ... more emotional less less restrained I mean\nNASCAR drivers have to be amongst the most ... emotionally controlled people in the world right when you're whirling around a track at two hundred miles an hour\nBut you see in the book that now I was just angry angry all the time that you drove your car back to the garage and ESPN had a TV camera there waiting on me big pack reporters wanting to ask you about the crash\nHe started talking in your eyes get why any volume picks up in your face starts turning\nRed and here's what you said\nI Can't believe that everybody is no\nNobody sensible enough to\nRealize just how ridiculous that was a man was hey is ridiculous if it's what we did every week I wouldn't be doing it I'll just put it to you like that\nIs that we write several week I'd find a job it's bloodthirsty if that's the way people alone or ...

[laughter]\nThat's all it is\nYeah definitely that long pause that's what everyone hoped it all it was but shortly before the September two thousand two protection won four hundred in Kansas City so several months after that Fontana crash a Earnhardt junior was interviewed about the concussion he had in California\nI made my own decision and a ... a ... than in the car was the only thing that really helped me decide ah [noise]\nYou know exactly how bad the situation was on a loan I needed to get better but I Know better next time I shouldn't get it a secret as much as I did but um\nI didn't want to cause too much alarm because it really wasn't a series I guess is that everybody has made it out\nOh I Know better next time I sit and again that is sacred as much as I did but\nI didn't want to do much alarm because it really wasn't a series I guess their body of made it out there be\nDale Earnhardt junior back in two thousand two\nWell joining us now is Michael Mickey Collins he's the director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program and he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior four concussions in two thousand twelve you also wrote the forward for\nA racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey Collins welcome to um point\nOr it's really great to have you because obviously as as Dale writes in the book you're real a key figure in his healing from the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office I mean you've treated thousands of of of folks and professional athletes\nI mean what did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\nWhile I've seen him twice um two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale we actually got they'll better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapies a second time I saw Dale he was very sick hum with these issues that we commonly see with concussion\nAnd quite honestly I I didn't care as much about Dale becoming a race car driver again I I Want a deal to become a human that felt normal and that was the first president for everything and\nAnd then just jump in here though 'cause I mean the the the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book uh there was a vision problems balance problems uh all the all the things I hand eye coordination all the things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving it two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of life of life you know\nSo racing really wasn't it wasn't even on the radar initially saw Dale and and you know we've really identified will learn a lot of caution and there's so much we learn now in terms of identifying where the labyrinth signals coming from and matching the right treatment to the right problem and\nAnd we were able to do that with Dale and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and said I'm On a course of rehab that um that eventually got him better and and Dale is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nSo uh but Nikki Collins I think one thing that surprised me about what Dale wrote in the book is that you prescribed both times is very\nUh but Mickey Collins I think one thing that surprised me about what Dale wrote in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very very specific specific regimen of exercises and a protocol essentially that would push his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that\nUh perhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when and brain is healing from from concussions\nI that's a common a perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment\nWe've actually identified now that there are six different types of concussions and\nThere were some types of concussions where quote unquote rest or at least regulated rest it may be indicated but in details profile of difficulties and the way you treat the problems that Dale had is actually ... training\nAnd so it depends on what type of concussion you have as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach a whether the rate regulation or whatnot but\nYou have to you need to go to a clinician that can identify again whereas the average single coming from and then in a national right tribute to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because\nThis is not a homogenous event it's a very heterogeneous event if this if this thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nYeah well Dale Earnhardt junior and in the book you write that the second time that you sought treatment from uh from Mickey Collins that you didn't actually get all that many phone calls from from drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver culture is like but you did hear from some drivers who had either\nPreviously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help [noise]\nYeah actually that was so interesting I guess I'm you know a\nFrom retire drivers or even drivers that had just recently had suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice and looking just really just to be able to contact Mickey how to get a Pittsburgh where he was in and see him um that was\nI think the beginning of the\nReason for writing this book and making has told me time and time again or whether it's an article someone's red or he's read or whether it's you know whatever it is like you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here\nOr whether it's you know whatever it is like you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here and he'll tell you that he has people that come in every week that um connect\nUh you know their visit to the hospital to something they read or saw me talk about and that encourage meant for Mickey to continue to talk continued to be honest continue to be open and transparent\nAs a result in this book and ah you know so that I I Love helping people especially when you can follow along with their progress or if it's you know I've made friends by meeting strangers\nAnd directing them to Mickey and continuing to support them and continuing to you know encourage them through the process and not made some pretty good friends to sorry to interrupt\nYou there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Mickey Collins said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that\nYou were so concerned freaked out really about uh uh how much you were struggling after your your dual concussions in in twenty twelve that he told you that it could be fixed now ... why did not why was it so profound for you\nThat you know he did that on a couple occasions I had I'll I'll I'll toss I'll talk about this one in particular I had my eyes were not working I'm not focusing not shocked that they weren't stable if I walked across the room\nThey ... you know the ... the environment and shook and I my eyes just wouldn't uh wouldn't settle and it was so", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year":
