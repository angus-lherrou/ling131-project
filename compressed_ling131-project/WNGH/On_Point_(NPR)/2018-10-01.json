two thousand twelve book I think bull by the horns if that's it's it's a story that the very beginning of the book and it's just it's so telling them\nWell there's a story that you tell in your two thousand twelve book I think bull by the horns if it's it's a story that the very beginning of the book and it's just\nIt's so telling those hoping you could read if you could share it once again with us and it's it's a story about um how you in two\nThousand eight in October two thousand eight you attend is very key meeting at the treasury with Hank Paulson and I believe what a seven of the top CEOs of the biggest financial institutions in America\nRight yeah well that was um [noise]\nThat was quite a quite a meeting it was false and they called it\nI was their members air Tim Geithner was there the head of the other banking regulators or were there and um the purpose of the beating was basically for us to tell the banks that uh we were going to take some interventions that we wanted them all to participate\nThere was this they they were so you know the ... the court center piece of it was the tarp capital investment yet are going to\nPut under the millions of dollars into a new capital into these banks are the FDIC was gonna start within limits and for the we're going to start a year and she uh the debt that they needed to issue to roll expiring debt we had because the markets were seized up and they were having hard time refinancing their own debt\nAnd then the fed had trillions of dollars of living facilities that they\nThey put into place and so it ... it was basically to explain those news programs [noise]\nAnd uh they had to take the ... well yeah I you know and as I say that I think a lot of that was it was designed to cover up the problems the weaker banks like city I think most of them not all but most of them probably could've bumble true\nBut we didn't want to test that and ah and also there was a lot of fear that if you're just singled out certain banks for\nAssistance you're going to make them look bad you know exacerbate their problems right so uh yeah that was the reason I\nI just read a paragraph from from from the book because it's so telling about\nI think that the the state of the financial system that maybe ... many Americans just weren't aware of before two thousand eight you say you know this is a meeting of Monday October thirteenth too doesn't it you say nine men stood milling around in the room men I should know right nine men\nAre really truly some and thereby treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you write I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\nDollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you write I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\n[laughter] yeah that's right [laughter] well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there's even balance of power and and I still think we suffer from it that\nUh you know who works for he does it just doesn't work for the banks are you know or or did just that the banks banks and the safety net get FDR said ... insurance and fed access and all of that\nDo they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these so government support like Deposit Insurance can can incentivize a risk taking and too big to fail\nJust really doubles down on that so yeah I I did not I didn't want there to many question about the balance of power and he was in charge and it wasn't you know and I certainly didn't want to look like I was awake legs so uh you know I think that some of them told me they're afraid of me I don't know if there that's a joke [laughter]\nI Can't I Can't\nBe a little directed at times I Will be the first to admit that but I Do think that it was important for the government to be the person in charge\nAnd well I mean I just I I'm I Am so the numbers just looking at the ... the sentence written on the piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me\nNine trillion dollars and edit Seventy percent of the U.S financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and two interconnected to feel that we had well\nIt it it is and whether we fix it I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric\nAnd Tim Geithner obviously he and I have had our disagreements and and their policy disagreements but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're going to have another financial system that's going to need government help and so we need\nMore bailout tools and I think that's absolutely the wrong system that is a system we still have that we don't want to say that system you would like banks go down now oh well we we have something called title to and which we did not have a ... in two thousand eight and yes\nThat allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed to you know put a bag into a resolution process to break it up you know keep his bad assets out impose the losses on the shareholders and the and secured creditors\nBreak it up you know keep his bad assets out impose the losses on the shareholders in the end secured creditors which is where the lawsuit should be and where the losses are also if you go through a traditional bankruptcy\nTo fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the bank you know and and you're bringing new investors new management\nTo and and in return they healthy parts of the bag a back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process or some unique things about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a difficult to you yeah\nThat's a tool we didn't have into them we have now been regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind them markets that this this is going to be the new paradigm this is the new process not bailouts would accountability\nFor going to ask you can ask you know of course so many questions to live there because I I I'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as some like crazy anti capitalist has not ... no no no I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis\nI mean as long as the banks are too big already wanna brand oh\nWell uh there are people who have that view and I can understand that view and ah yeah I I don't think there's a political will a Martian to do that I mean and this is bipartisan and unfortunately you see\nLegislation going through now the reduced uh three the largest banks we have reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this bill that just passed\nAnd in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress testing requirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say because I'm a Republican and I thought you know Republicans are market oriented\nButter Republicans trying to pressure the fed to reduce capital even more so that's a political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter] that's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else and and my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before\nThey finally happens but yeah I mean if they needed a bailout again I think ... our democracy cannot survive that and if they think\nAnd again she liver I said I don't our democracy cannot survive another round of bailouts it just it can't look look at what happened you know people who discount the role of the two thousand a crisis\nAnd and even you know the eight million a homeless lost nine million jobs lost you know that the terrible hit to the public purse still people struggling and lower middle income families um\nPlus nine million jobs lost you know the the terrible hit to the public purse still people struggling and lower middle income families um\nThat started with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ... in ... and I think that's a lot of what if he's in the discontent we have right now so to suggest that we're going to bail out so yeah that that's going to be the new paradigm\nThat we don't really need to bother regulation trying to prevent crises we just need to be repaired with more taxpayer bailout tools I don't think democracy is going to tolerate that well you\nKnow so okay that's quite a bracing thing that you said and yet ... of the speaking with you and other people who were very key to the uh in the two thousand two thousand nine period for any financial observer most people say we probably will have another crisis though so how does that square with our democracy yeah well\nTo CDs worth of the best of wait wait

they they're\nWell to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran\nSo listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're at one eight hundred for two three to five find this eight hundred for two three talk\nWell joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lose it's good to have you\nThank you for having me also with us from\nTyson's corner Virginia is ... rent for he's a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you\nHey thanks for having me\nAll right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by that we've got a link to it at home plate radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria\n[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the prior U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern scary in order to fight ISIS is being expanded\nSo the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged a Pentagon officials up to and including fed current events matter\nThat us troops are only fighting ISIS however they do ... secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country\nA boat in kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us withdraw is uh the withdrawal of Iranian forces\nSo that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters\nIran a hence the condition for us withdrawal is uh the withdrawal of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters that waste\nRight so I'm seeing here the James Jeffrey just uh the state department special representative for Syria a following John Bolton comments said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission again\nUntil Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right they're they're counterterrorism authorizations [noise]\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers all ... and I'm its affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq\nAnd so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission\nUm and so I think that the way the if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to cook it by saying that us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit\nWell Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I may be to use ... phrase called description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region [noise]\nWell\nI think people in the Phoenix surprised by the second one coming out you can't survive on that we've seen yet because she wouldn't have a few months ago um ... said the chips are going to be going home very very soon and was actually an expectation that they would be passed on by the end of the year\nAnd most of the regional palate all involved in Syria Sochi, Russia Jackie\nI'm no everyone else in the neighborhood has been expecting he likes to go and they can predicates you're not going to see us troops going the idea that that actually going to be staying I mean definitely definitely puts them back like\nIn ... when it comes to negotiate cheating and then this area and more and I think it should be I don't care whether that she'll go and eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said\nYeah glad that she'll go and eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric on ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners few harm our citizens\nIf you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be hell to pay\nWell the very next day on Wednesday of last week week some lawmakers did question or the U.S is military role in Syria and this expansion of uh that military\nObjective they question Robert ... assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and here you are going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton pressing came to get more specific about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission and fighting ISIS\nThe problem is that national security adviser John Bolton state of the United states intends to keep an indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws for its forces\nThat to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran especially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of Iran not actions of ISIS or the defeat of ISIS\n... let me ask you about this because it seems as if what Congress in molten is saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional authorization for that\n[laughter] yeah so he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're in the region with the mission to balance against those forces or restrict those forces freedom maneuver through eastern Syria\nMeans that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization\nHas the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that\nI mean I don't think that they don't think any real administration has a show in a willingness to get a new authorization to use military force ah I mean that's the question at the Aspen brought up ah during the past airstrikes that have occurred against the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons\nThey have to use military force ah I mean that's a question of the ... been brought up ah during the past airstrikes that have occurred against uh the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons attacks some people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from two doesn't want it to happen to\nKnow loosely me in the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said\nWe'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to stability to stability and peace in the middle east in the region\nAnd to that effect you today you just went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show the Israelis it wasn't a missiles like can you can you tell us a little bit more about that\nWell yes I'm\nAt the United nations um last week the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture\nA photograph he took it was a shock to like Jim age and with the ... hours on it he ... to ... sites that\nWhen his ... story well manufacturing filed to be which could be used to think more and file such gate the at the he's fine
