did it with no roads that effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy chain and Alex tunneled\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you've taken how you mentally prepare for the climb do you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single move 'em I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about with the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I Move my body\nBut then you know a firm I Know for pitch one was very rough just like step left or to keep place you know the rest of the picture I could just count on myself to to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then I also climbed the whole the whole face so many times that I kinda just remembered most of it\nUm you know but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay [laughter] but so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense of ... when you first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental arm or what is\nThat why I actually um I actually don't call a mental learners and in the film a Tommy says that a few times and he's actually sort of quoting something I'm like I've had some other climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor\nBut I'm actually a big part of the process for me to be able to ... free solo cap was to sort of get past that I think especially like the idea of mental armor as to just sort of\nYou know shield yourself from like is it something that's too scary you sort of get psyched up and like shield your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like that wasn't really a sustainable way to climb oh crap like it it's just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that\nThat at some point you know it's sort of come to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Need the wall is the wall and I'm and I am capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up or anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus in work that it takes to get to that\nWhere yeah I mean that's that's that's basically the the film now two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining my techniques and eventually you know I mean it took a long time to feel comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include districts\nPhysically and mentally and practicing and and just refining my techniques and eventually you know I mean it took a long time to show comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I've been dreaming about it and thinking about it and climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I couldn't talk to you for the whole hour about the technical have preparation and I'm feet of climbing el ... but ... free solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free so many of them have died and then that is\nShown in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climber Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing\nSome of the death of the world's best free solar climbers\nI think everybody who was made for ... a big part of their life\nOr with a tiny arrest so called three fellow climbing the mountain we didn't ask me at the age of fifty two\nWe're sorry to sort of on the death of us climate showing Larry\nShow was killed in Utah was found a couple of days ago there were seeing was climbing a new somebody valley body was found Saturday morning\nProceed climate as usual alone without road\nMost people that are pushing the limits to have this mentality of\nScrew it whatever happens happens\nDown there from the documentary free so low I mean that just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing with no ropes that has really that really drew you in [noise]\nYeah well yeah a good a good question um I mean basically you know I mean so not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes ... you mean scrambling a beautiful ridge and the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for rope climbing in the mountains it's sort of a more efficient and faster way to climb\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up climbing the Sierra um I mean you could I was I was sort of an antisocial youngsters so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the feeling of freedom to speed or the efficiency I mean there's certain joy and climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it to be clear free sewing a stone a small fraction of of my normal climbing there you know I'm a crime all styles you know all you know every sort of climbing rope\nSmall fraction of of my normal climbing there you know I'm a crime all styles you know all\nYou know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various various types of climbing and then for selling has always sort of represented this this extra little side\n[laughter] but but you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean yeah\nYou don't know I yeah I totally understand that and I mean it certainly always been a very inspiring part of climate to me as well you know it's only a small part of what I Do okay you know it's always been sort of the most significant and a lot of ways\nTo talk to me about that I mean what is it how is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads I mean is it is it known that you just cannot enter or experience in any other way\nWell I I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience that feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into that that feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling of flow whatever you want to call it but\nBut um you know feeling like you're you're close to to tap into your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell here here's why ask okay because I mean a a a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know and on in in some beautiful places in the western United States and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every climbed that I did that I got a little better at and this is like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even lie like low level climbing every every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering minded ...\nFeeling of constant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what what I enjoy about for so long as you know seeking out slightly bigger challenges things that are slightly harder than what you've done before so you feel like you're confident learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit of butter or what you do\nBut of course with free soul you know the cost of the mistake of absolute so you know you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but then inevitable end\nWell I mean we were all facing in ... I mean we're all gonna die um I'm trying my best not to die climbing you know are very much want to move to old age and have a family and all that but um\nAnd a dog ... I'm trying my best not to dot com and you know are very much want to move to old age of family and all that but um no I mean I I I don't think that if I just keep pushing middle for sure dark climbing on the town will go\nWell let me just reiterate nobody wants to [laughter] but um ... we get some calls in here because we got a lot of people who have questions for you Alex we're speaking with Alex ... he is a professional rock climber a best known\nI'm Steven Fowler I'll take a closer look\nAt how Georgia's elections are run this afternoon on all things considered from four to seven\nFor MORNING EDITION and on second thought to political rewind and all things considered split their support make everything you hear on TV possible if we didn't hear from your during our fault fund drive\nYour contribution now still make a difference [noise] we take just a couple of minutes to support the programs you rely on um enjoy on ... and do your part now at whatever level is right for you\nGood at ... dot org and click donate and thanks so much for your support of Georgia Public broadcasting [noise]\nI'm used to Marlins a legal battle rages over a question on the twenty twenty cents as the Trump Administration wants to ask about the citizenship status of people living in the U.

talking this hour with Alex tunneled he is a rock climbing superstar and he is the first person in the world to free so low that means without robes Yosemite is three thousand foot wall el ... and that feed is documented in a new movie free solo which is directed by Elizabeth chai far Sally and\nJimmy Chin I'm going to get to some college here in a second but Alex we just heard a professor gene Joseph there who did that MRI skin of your brain started talking about some of the unique things that she saw a in her analysis they're wondering now that you know that about\nUm you know the the shape in response of your ... has that changed at all sort of how you see a you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\nNot particular um yeah I mean in general I I have a strong sense of I mean I Am who I Am and you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside I mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but\nUm I mean we we had a much longer discussion when we first to scan yeah and um and to take away to me was basically just put into practice that over time you can do sometimes up to ... and that was very much been my experience\nThat um that you can burn over time it was next year from I heard that she was at one of the premier is for for free so I Would have been good to see her but I've been on it and share it with her more I sure\nOkay well we can put we can definitely get you back in touch here I was really excited to have to because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this uh you are living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and persevere and says well about what can be accomplished but that's\nThat's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen this and uh and they just said it was like oh well your brain's factors obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it um I mean I've always heard it as as you know with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know and so I suppose it's a little bit open a new\nBut one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of uh of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to a caller wants to talk to you about exactly that so let's go to Garret who is calling from Deir ...\nOf of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call or who wants to get a caller who wants to talk to you about exactly that so let's go to Gary he's calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\nI I like um you know it's one thing to to watch your preparing to go through in a regular on the wall where you are in their every move but\nThere's also the aspect of family and bought one and I was just wondering how you prepare them and how do you mentally prepare um before going out of one of these big feet like al ... and do a photo of loved ones or anything like that ever come into your mind while you're you know and the ... stuff is multi thousand for them\nYeah I mean that does and that's probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend saw it and how we sort of navigate about because in a lot of ways reselling it'd be easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nUm but you know Saudis always sort of argued that uh that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level and just needed to to balance it properly and I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we navigated All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general how you know we had a totally normal normal healthy relationship\nWell let me ask you was asking though in the middle of a big climb I mean well let's talk about your al ... ascent on August ... did you think of her or is it was you bring that I mean how how focused\nOn the on the harder sections which represents maybe half the ... um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing moves interest performing but then on the easier train 'em I was able to think about other things and think about friends and partners huh\nI mean I remember specifically on on my free souls or cap I spent you know maybe a five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey than than\nYou I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I talked out about my girlfriend um [laughter] you know when I'm finished\nWell I mean ... as you write in a free solo does the movie does explore um your relationship with Saudi McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you\nHow are you factor her into your decisions about free cell or climbing\nInch a sunny is asking you how are you factor her into your decisions about free solar climbing\nOne and I'm like I Want to have in mind let's take a price that you have a caller I'm going to die like minds on knew what we want to do over here and it didn't have when people die\nFeel like I Want in a way\nWhen you sound like you take me back later\nRussia than going to be on with putting him and I actually am a changing you actually make decisions having\nHad some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan\nAnd like you obviously have to give up so I got on\nWest ... can you do you see that as an obligation now\nOr not [noise]\nBut I appreciate your your concerns I have you know I respect that but but I Know what your job or you know\nIs that true Alex you still feel obligated to maximize your life span\nYeah kind of hard for me to listen to some of those there's no like oh I mean I have a boat struggled through the whole film there there's some restrictions on our whole cringe that's that's pretty that's that was on top or you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that that a big part of what I was getting out there that\nYou know whether I'm thinking about her or my family or anybody else\nUm I you know I don't want to die climbing like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall and so\nYou know if I'm if I'm thinking about others you know what I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared yeah it's about\nBut also I mean that that conversation I think we've been dating for about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently all kept for maybe the seven proceeding years\nAnd so I felt like the ratio is what it was different you know I mean now we've been in a great relationship for three years and I was you know finish this big crime and so you know moving forward them I'm sure the calculations would be different\nOh okay so there are potentially a tent and also to shore potentially\nSo well I'm sure it would be different and yeah I'm sure it would be different or I don't know which way you know\nLet's go to another caller Michael's calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air\nGreens or how you're doing a ... early Alex you have the uh the mutant climber brain so congratulations", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "09"}
