Stanford joins us as well she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us\nIn our own point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of go you you gave us the top three bullet points of the\nUh aspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect sending them but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what do you mean oh\nWell first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago my call this is high I I was like we hung out together yeah I Know it was really fun Aslam\nAnd I think I mean as I Know there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic the healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage of fat people with metabolic healthy obesity in some studies find a much larger percentage\nAnd I actually you know for team up feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter that we know how difficult weight is to lose and we know how harmful it is the shame people for their weight\nAnd so if there are big health effects of obesity\nI'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important\nYou know I mean I I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man their health risk associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine for my doctor to talk to me about those things\nBut he needs to talk to me about those things in a\nHealthy and accepting and questioning way right of what are your sexual practices water your drug use practices and not in this way that hello and then two seconds into the appointment he says oh well because you're using math I think you should stop using that\nI mean one thing that came away from me from your clinic Pitino was the way that you guys had an hour long appointment with patients and you were really listening to them and that's something that with primary care providers a lot of fat patients just never get that luxury of somebody\nAsking them about their habits and listening to what they say and believing them\nA lot of patients period\nA lot of patience just never get that luxury of somebody asking them about their habits and listening to what they say and believing them\nWell a lot of patients period will never get that luxury primary care physician doctor to ever go ahead yeah so\nI Want to touch on a few points number one I Want to remove some of the language or language that I wouldn't use with my patients which has fat or skinny I can tell you that patients on the extremes meaning either very lean or ones that have obesity\nI'm often um are taken aback by those terms and we do know obesity is a disease process all say that the patient has either mild moderate to severe obesity [noise] um so that we know that we're treating the disease and not labeling them by that because I Do think that promotes ... and stigma so I Want us to to make sure that we don't do that\nNow this idea or concept of metabolic healthy obesity\nIs such that we look at a patient the patient we know has mild moderate to severe obesity but there's nothing that we're able to define\nClearly by taking like blood samples or things of that sort that really points to them having any disease pathology what we're finding is that this term metabolic fully healthy obesity as as a little bit falling out of favor because we're we're finding is that even in patients where things appeared normal on the surface\nThey do have issues so for example\nI have adolescent patients that we send to weight loss surgery these are patients\nThat obviously have moderate to severe obesity um and when you look at them they may have no obesity ... conditions at the time of surgery what we do at the time of operation for most of these patients as we do a liver biopsy and what's that liver biopsy were able to determine if the patient has fatty liver disease\nNow if you look at their liver function tests if you do an ultrasound of their liver we're finding that it appears is that they don't have liver disease but when they do that biopsy we're finding that about Ninety five percent of these adolescence\nThat we're sending to surgery actually have fatty liver disease Ninety five percent or Ninety five percent of the patients we just finished a study looking at this so that shows you that we're not picking up on something in a way that we might in an adult\nWho question of about this because I think you know there's something that Michael said that really is stuck in my head now where he he was I think he's pointing out like but but why should a neurologist though\nBe talking to someone about their weight when that person is there for a migraine and and you know I Want to relate to what you just said Dr Stanford because of how\nWe're all just isn't going to find evidence of of fatty liver disease anyway he's been living lives but let's look at what you guys just said and this is I'm going to put on my medical habits\nSo how is it just isn't going to find evidence of of fatty liver disease anyway but let's look at what you guys just said and this is I'm going to put all my medical have because that's why you guys have me here so patients that have obesity\nHave a high likelihood of having migraines and just coincidentally many of the drugs they are ... there used to treat migraine headaches also are great for weight loss\nSo when I find that my patience and I would say about fifty percent of my adult patients have a history of migraine headaches and have obesity I might can currently be treating with the medication both disease process is I'm getting rid of their migraines they're losing weight it's a win win situation so I Would say that they're neurologist approaching them\nMaybe from the lens of neurology using that migraines as a as a key um place to come in but we recognize that remember we talked about every disease process that we know affects all organ systems soon at all it is one of the very important one Michael did you want to respond to that\n[noise] well I think I mean the stories that I'm hearing\nFrom fat people are not that they're neurologist or saying you know we have a couple of morbidity is do you mind if we run some tests\nThe stories that I'm hearing are we won't run any test until you lose weight I mean I've been hearing from people that their doctors refused to give them an MRI until they lose weight their doctors refuse to give them fertility treatment until they lose weight I think when we talk about obesity care we tend to conflate\nWeight loss and the care that fat people get when they go to the doctor and I think that it's it's really worthwhile to separate those two things because\nNot every fat person goes to the doctors seeking to lose weight a lot of them\nFeel like their life is fine if you like their habits or find they don't feel like they have to lose weight or they're already on a plan by themselves with their husband whatever trying to lose weight and some other way all they needed a doctor to treat their ear ache right or if they if they get on a train accident they need somebody who's going to be compassionate and he's going to fix that ... D located shoulder\nAnd so I think it's really important that doctors take very seriously this idea that\nFat people are not getting effective medical care and a lot of people just shows up in studies to that fat people avoid going to the doctor because they're afraid that they're going to get shame for their weight if they don't get cancer screenings because they're afraid of what the interaction with the nurse is going to be like they don't want to be weighed and I think if you're thinking about effective care\nI think it's fine for a neurologist to bring up hey you know based on the research we have a couple of things that are related weighed might be related to migrants that kind of thing but that's not the kinds of interactions that people are having it's really important to think about how\nThings that are related weight might be related to migrants that kind of thing but that's not the kinds of interactions that people are having it's really important to think about how pervasive weight stigma is and how weight does this credit patience with their doctors often times in specialties that are really only tangentially related to weight ducks\nNever go ahead yeah so I Do agree that we as physicians overall don't do a great job of approaching patients that struggle with their weight secondary to our own biases\nAnd an adequate education surrounding how to treat patients that have obesity what we do know when you do cover this in your article is that um education surrounding obesity nutrition physical activity and medical schools residency programs throughout the country is minimal at best\nI can tell you that there are several organizations working on improving the standards um surrounding this issue because we do know that forty percent of the adult population has obesity and Nineteen percent of the pediatric patient has will be the which means that this is by far the most prevalent chronic disease and so I agree that we do have some work\nAnd Margaret Brian in Delano thanks to all of you for supporting gp be be the next generous listener we hear from right now every listener every contribution makes a difference\nThe important thing though is that you don't put it off make sure your contribution counts and helps us in this campaign successfully in the next couple of days you do that with your support right now at eight hundred to two to four seven eight or G.

I'm Sorry Michel ... article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr ... song\nFrom them teach weight center was interviewed and we do have all of our patients um spend time with the psychologist delving to issues such as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behaviors because of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life\nSo I Do think that that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like Dr song working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops to do a good job by bringing those voices into the army so I Want to switch\nFlight Dr solved working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops did do a good job by bringing those voices into the army so\nI Want to switch you can switch gears here for a second um and and take a step back and Michael we'll bring you in back in here for this as well\nBecause I'm Dr Stanford I just I've heard you a couple of times in this conversation you know call ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight but\nFifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese American anywhere where near what we have now so I mean I don't I I don't think anyone's gonna say that\nThe this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and so and so so this is such a lay person question but I just want to get your feel for it and and ... and Michael you to\nIs it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it kind of happened overnight absolutely I think this is I'm\nReally we are in an OB so Jenike environment so I call it the perfect storm what we have is we have had a change in our food quality\nWe've had a change in our physical activity we've had a change in the quality and duration of our sleep we've had a change in circadian rhythm um disturbances what I mean by that is that we are rewarded with being able to talk to our colleagues in Russia\nAnd talk to our colleagues in India when we're supposed to be sleep here in the United states to tell you that maternity is terrible for our house [laughter] and I say that ... not jokingly right if you're talking about\nSleep and and physical activity and food and especially for people who are in lower income getting that high quality food Michael you pointed this out it's like eight times more expensive than the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega\nYeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less and exercise more that assumes that people have the time to exercise and that their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids\nAnd two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people you know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids you're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen and process and whatever else and that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think\nBroccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids you're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen and process to whatever else and that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have we we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and\nThe choices that we make with in those options I don't think there's blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them\nTo do and so the reason why I wanted to bring this up Dr Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and um\nEven in that context this conversation it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know a ... individual responsibility as things that can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to look way outside of\nThat we have to go outside the box we need to bring together a person's in healthcare persons and that our policy makers\nUm physical activity facility schools et cetera I always talk about bringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a\nIn a direction where we actually have any data on obesity rates in both a pediatric an adult population and and I think what we've done with regards to this epidemic his work\nEntirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and\nOh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive
