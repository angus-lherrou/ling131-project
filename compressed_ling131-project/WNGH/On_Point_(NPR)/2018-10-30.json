I I still have some sort of basic questions about how a an schooling or self directed learning really work because it seems as if it requires or perhaps ... success is based on how self directed a child is [noise]\nAnd um you know I'm Wondering what about all those kids who if they are really given the choice to do anything they want all day long would just up to turn on the TV and sit there for eight hours\n[noise] but you know the kids that we see who uh sit there for eight hours turning on the TV are largely kids who are going to public school they're coming home and sit and watch a TV right [laughter] so\nThis issue of self directed what is it being to be self directed um [noise]\nI uh I'm an evolutionary psychologist so I'm interested in human nature and the nature of children [noise]\nLook at little kids have you ever seen a little kid who hasn't yet gone to school who's not self directed who's not just curious playful and eagerly doing things they're exploring the world almost from the moment they're born there looking around what's out there with new what can I learn about [noise]\nThink of all the things that children learn before they ever go to school and this is not this is not just some children that learn that this is essentially all the children they learned their native language from scratch [noise]\nThey learn an enormous amount about the physical world around them and the social world around them so on schooling is this what if we just left them continue to do that and that of put them away where their own questions don't count anymore\nWhere their own play is considered at best recess which is increasingly being taken away rather than a way of learning\nWhere socialization is almost cut off because they're not really allowed to talk to one another to cooperate people talk about socialization being missing if you're not going to school what kinds of socialization truly is occurring there [noise]\nSo we send them to school and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because we've taken away the basic motives\nWell and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because we've taken away the basic motives for learning curiosity playfulness so they have the ability\nIf I may just have been here for a second I I thought I had read that quote from you I'm perhaps it was actually in the Boston Globe peace where how did you said before that you believe that really basically all all kids should be made to learn is to learn how to read and maybe some or else some arithmetic and then leave the rest of it up to them\nYou know this was a ... okay I tried to get them to change that [laughter] and I sent a correction that was published two weeks later that was a complete mess quotes [noise]\nOne of my own research has shown that children learn to read with out direct instruction when they are allowed to learn to read in their own ways at the time that they are motivated to do it they may ask for some help but nothing like the kind of stretching and [noise]\nAh I have yet to see a child who's been as self directed education who hasn't eventually learn to read they learned to read it in very different ages\nRight here's why I'm asking that question because if we're leaving a hundred percent of what a child learns up to that kid [noise]\nDon't we take the very grave risk that they're going to choose things that might well it might fulfilled them or it isn't the entire suite of what they need to be successful happy citizens of the modern world I mean I'm thinking what if a kid doesn't\nWe can make an argument that they're not learning these things in school right now but I'm going to set that aside but what if they don't want to learn things like civics or how government works or they don't want to learn about history or they don't want to learn about uh\nYou know financial issues et cetera all things that I Would argue are really ... you know really important\nUh to to living in the modern world\nAren't we sort of sending them back by not giving them at least the opening the door to these things to them\nWell you know ... if we make people learn things if we if we require them to learn things the first question is are they really learning your car they learning at in a way that is meaningful to that stays with them so let's take civics for example [laughter]\nSo in schools we deprive children of all their civil rights\nLiterally we deprive them of their civil rights and then we lecture to them about civics 'cause that real civics lesson or is it better civics lesson\nLiterally we deprive them of their civil rights and then we lecture to them about civics cars that are real civics lesson or is a better civics lesson to say\nHey you're growing up in a democracy here growing up in a world where you are responsible for your own life\nYou are also responsible for other people you you are also free to choose your own path unhappiness isn't that a better civics lesson than a lecture on it you are living it\nYou are limited in what in what though that that you'll have ultimate than total freedom for your entire life which is not true we'll have to live in a society\nBut you know something\nYes we do have to live in a society and children who are growing up in charge of their own lives are experiencing what it is to live in a society they are learning how to live in a society and it's also not the case that there nobody has totally free nobody can do things that break the law\nYou know there are many many students who are in self directed education are going to learning centers or a school learning stuff and they make rules they make the rules democratic way there are lots of rules you can't literally you care if you take out toys you have to put them away\nYou can't there are rules against bowling and so forth but they're democratically made rules and isn't that a better civics lesson\nMoly ... been patiently listening here and I want to get your view what what's your response to my question here that perhaps where we're at risk of not introducing important lessons or a or subjects to children if they're totally self directed\nWell for me I I question what the word introduced me and in this context because\nIntroducing if I'm looking at it from a school perspective there there's an indoctrination that comes from that and for me as a self directed into an schooling parrot we can introduce but there is no indoctrination there is no forced to take that on so the idea that these things will not be\nIntroduced or seen or felt as something that\nI don't necessarily agree with that goes to the amusement park and that's physics\nAt its best happening in motion for them to experience what that is for them when they're ready and whether politics all of these things are very much important but that happens at the playground a there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go\nPolitics all of these things are very much important\nBut that happens at the playground or there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go that is not something that is specific to going to a traditional schooling setting that's everywhere so my daughters are huge into making sure that their identity is affirmed everywhere that they go and they also participate and actions\nThat create inclusion and diversity and equity so that has nothing to do with school\nWell a ... and Peter you can imagine that we have a lot of [laughter] want to join us so let me just get a couple of

let the three notes that the comments and colds are all pouring in we pick these topics that we should talk about for two to three hours at a time but\nBut we've got some pushback coming in uh on line for example Joe American or sent us this tweet saying this sounds like another progressive concept that will result in deficiencies in knowledge and a greater dependency on government just more collective ism packaged as social improvements\nOn our website on point radio dot org ... says uh Kathy this isn't a response a response to something you said Malaysia Kathy saying no an amusement park is not physics physics is the math and process that results in a safe and exciting amusement park rides\nCat he thinks this sounds just like whew nonsense moly ... would you like to respond to that\nI mean for a cafe than that stature position and I totally respect that\nUm for me I see it differently and that's that's what makes us all unique and the biggest the biggest thing about this about exploring what learning is is the liberation of being indoctrinated into a system that wasn't built for a person like myself\nIt was not built for me to truly explore and be innovative and look at this as an opportunity to really shine and that's what I'm allowing my children to do whether it has\nAn effect that may be viewed as negative or not that's you know how anyone feels is none of my business is pretty much the model I follow so as much as I appreciate her perspective um\nThat's that's what works for us and my children are learning and growing and thriving so why does it matter to me\nHave another comment here on Facebook Jennifer Russell says formal school doesn't teach children socialization Jennifer says it teaches them institutionalization let's go to Steven who's calling from Florence South Carolina Steven you're on the air\nSchool doesn't teach children socialization Jennifer says it teaches them institutionalization let's go to Steven who's calling from Florence South Carolina Steven you're on the air\nThank you very much my questions I Hope aren't too simplistic but\nIf you could tell me what sort of things should I look or my child to see if he's a good candidate for this type of war lean at what age did it again and what sort of parameters or\nBoundaries are needed if we go into this sort of um in educational process\nSteven first of all I'm going to tell you there is no such thing on this program as overly simplistic question especially when we're talking about education so I actually thank you very much for your call Peter gray do you have some answers ...\nThe question well Wendy began and it begins at birth [laughter] yeah you can't stop it from beginning at birth children now beginning to self educated as soon as they're more they're learning constantly they're constantly learning\nSo one of the questions that I've been interested in my own research is there are there some children who are more cut out for self directed education than for others and this is many people think well some people are sort of self motivated they can take control of their own life and so on\nMy experience has been that little children are all self motivated and that doesn't end if we allow to continue it does not end if we allow it to continue\nI think the I think the important thing to ask for anybody who wants to take this route is am I capable of trusting my child am I capable of allowing my child to learn what my child wants to learn even if it's not\nWhat I think my child should be learning at this point you have to give up a certain amount of sense of control [noise] now the truth of the matter\nAiling terror and my heart and let her as there's this guy\nTo give up a certain amount of sense of control you have to trust the nature of children I have learned over the years to do that because of my research that just because of my own experience with my own child but because of my research with many children [noise]\nAnd because of my research into the history of humanity throughout\nAlmost all of human history children always self educated we never had schools we never had [noise]\nThree of humanity throughout almost all of human history children always self educated we never had schools we never had\nHas so children come into the world burning to educate themselves we can't stop them from it unless we lock them away and closets and so on\nBut here's what we have to understand we are now living in a world where there's way more knowledge out there that any of us can possibly learn and who's to decide what's most important for any given child\nWe want people to grow up learning different aspects of that now why should everybody learn the same little slice of all the knowledge and skills and information\nThat schools have decided that the slice everybody should learn yeah you have to trust your child your child may not study physics maybe your child will study art history or whatever else maybe\nWe'll never learn how the gator I mean isn't that a lot of the matter\nIs that your child will have a job and the reason your child will have a job is because your child has learned to take control of his or her own life my what my research shows is that the graduate so self directed education are doing very well\nIn adult life there and not having difficulty getting child let me get a response you Michael Apple what do you think\nOh first START I appreciate what's been said that I Want to ask what are the characteristics not have children but if the parents do we really want a society which we say that children are simply the property of their parents\nWhen there's a growing movement in the United states for instance of anti Semitism of\nAnti of you know clearly racist kinds of things and I don't want to romanticize parents at all I Want to be very cautious about this because again I think parents have an ethical responsibility to be the best for their children but I Do think we want to look around us right now\nAnd ask very serious questions about what is being taught are there any any limits are we romanticize situations that are that we're putting parents and so that's my first my first response the second is\nUm we have to ask do you want a simply to have a society in which her children\nFrench second is um we have to ask do we want a simply to society and which children are simply\nTyrants no responsibility whatsoever [noise] larger society what can we do to make it more certain that the vast majority of children will go to schools actually get the kind of education that as many of the characteristics that movie trend 'cause you're wanting\nTo write well Michael let me let that Peter Graham illegal respond to that but Peter go\nI I think that's a wonderful point Michael that you've made and it's something that I've given a lot of thought to and concern to let me be clear I Do not think that home based on schooling is the solution to our national educational problems\nI think it's a great solution for many many families it's clearly a great solution as far as I can tell for for a ... and her daughter is is clearly a great solution for the many families that I have studied it works very well for them and it works very well for their children [noise]\nBut I don't think is the solution for everybody I think is probably even a minority of parents who should be doing this but what is happening and what is I think going to be that eventually the educational solution\nIs we're developing more and more learning centers and schools for self directed education is not happening within the public school system", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "30"}
