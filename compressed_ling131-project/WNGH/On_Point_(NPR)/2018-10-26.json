at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string obituary for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon don't pose though the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a cheap to oppose it you've called this one of the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nOne of the things we realized right away the mayor and eyes that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why chief of police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most\nAmerican cities um don't have a department of health right where either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide is the number one source of accidental death in our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with is that although it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine other drugs\nThere are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and the urges the human body for heroin and fentanyl are that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said you've been orphaned methadone there's a lot of stigma around um [noise]\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable and otherwise I won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower the mortality rate we can take a deep breath and we could move forward so\nAh what the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at\nOur needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment but you wanted to try some of the medication or you'll get a prescription for it and that prescription is written by a doctor or a doctor who lost a son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose instead of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America you can get a prescription\nMake conscious again and being kicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America you can get a prescription for buprenorphine\nAnd uh Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot and we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Merle Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place\nThat mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner or in our prison system who needs it and I'll say briefly that if you look at that a model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needs it the right medication the right time\nThey reduced post in car sort of overdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact they're down and Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of the ... percent eight percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things ah and hopefully it will turn the tide\nUm king O'Neill with this of helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean I Believe it would ... than incarcerated multiple times they never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think Burlington is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issue so if if it's if it's being ... you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and from our again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue and a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an abstinence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that [noise]\nBurlington and you know um kicked up ... will be leading that's and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about absence base which is another way of describing some of things like twelve steps you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean 'cause in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's gonna thirds its it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know\nRight I mean because in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to ... it's it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know I'm brand and just referred to this there's a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family when ... was first starting to get clean had the idea well if you're taking methadone or if you're taking to print our family you're not really create clean or not so far right\nAnd we can just you know there's so much evidence that show that these treatments are the most effective way to treat\nThis disease and sell denying people access are making it difficult for them to have access to it you know I'm\nI think you know if you if you have an issue\nWhere you have diabetes we don't say people you know like you can't have this drought it would help you get better and we make it difficult for people to get this drug on that would make them get better and there's stigma around that within the recovery community which I think it's hard to\n[laughter] it it was like if you please please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what Kate is saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of the opioid crisis we are headed\nFor or mitigate a disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically if you look at that public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIt's the medicines that we have available to us that reduce or the these bad outcomes I have a friend of my old town in the Hudson Valley who I did not know for years was a a recovering heroin addict\nI used to play with his kids we used to go to social events together and when I started doing this line of work you said Brandon\nI've been on ... for a decade now\nAnd it's the only reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an anecdote but um\nIf you just look at the success rates if anybody's spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine when it comes to addiction there is no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality\nIs a losing proposition and we need to make these medicines available and we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking a medicine to\nWrite yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we give someone the AIDS cocktail we don't have that stigma as Kate said when somebody has to take diabetes medicine for the rest of their life you know we've been getting fascinating\nAnd stronger response from listeners or as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not\n[noise] you know we've been getting fasting and strong response from listeners or as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not she used to have

great for me um I went from\nI hated pain medicine and so I had um oral surgery and they gave me ... and all of a sudden I was in love I thought this was happening I kidneys and then they gave me I think drugs um and\nThat was even better I was like God heaven on earth you know and then they and they turn English back out into the prescription and then that's it you know and then you're you're

you'll do just about anything you can to get what you need\nMhm thank you for that change that we've also call from Boston, Massachusetts Tom you're on the air go ahead\n[noise] hey how you're doing okay I think the police chief from\nVermont is right on but I I got to tell you if the drug companies that were providing the medicated assisted medication or pushing that drug as hot as\nPurdue chemicals pushed the uh actually caught and we wouldn't have a problem right now and because the medication is a fact of I I'm a recovering addict and I'm also a treatment provider and I've been doing it for twenty eight years\nAnd I've never seen anything like what I've seen over the last ten years\nYou know the the pharmaceuticals were bad enough but now that they're pulling back from the pharmaceutical ... as being a flooded throughout the addiction a heroin belt and Massachusetts anyway and so what I'm seeing I'm seeing people\nThat are stabilized on a on a medication and then what happens is they are off and then they relapse and die because there's no just plain relapses anymore it's just a\nGreat big it a shot up front and all of a they get the uh the uh her thirties that are that are really a crushed fat and all and they got a couple of them and they die now my history I was incarcerated because of my opiate a defendant's\nAnd er I relapsed that day I got out\nHad been read today I'd be dead\nBecause of twenty percent of the population that Iraq is living proven that have a addictive um a heroin histories die within the first ah two weeks because of an overdose so\nWe're ... let me let me let the folks here here weigh in on this but thank you for sharing boost your personal experience and also your expertise on this that makes you want to let you weigh in on a couple of things first you heard the statement a few minutes ago that I read a from Purdue Pharma talking about how they are a an\nActive part of the solution constructively engaging to find ways to remedy this and not currently part of the problem or how does that that seat in with your reporting on this [laughter] well um\nSits in in that um you know they just uh that have plans to create a new buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make a difference in America they could do as chief don't pose a another\nNew buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make a difference in America they could do as chief don't pose a and others and some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose deaths rates by a very little bit\nAnd make it widely available or the things I wanted to point out by what about the cheap and what's happening in Vermont\nIs that's really unusual I mean my hat is just off to him\nBut in states where are we were very slow to pass Medicaid we just passed it in Virginia became the thirty third recently\nI mean we have we have a ... talking forget that you're talking about Medicaid expansion right yeah I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion I mean we have waiting lists that range from three weeks to two years to get into MIT program we have no funneling from our ERs into MIT programs\nI'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against syringe exchange so\nNowhere for somebody to go we don't have any treatment in our jails and\nUm you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live uh whether you get this lifesaving\nTreatment or not but we we have a a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis reflection of American culture it's a disease of despair our cultures money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans in your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the\nConstruction of opportunities for Americans particularly in the rust belt in Appalachia\nA you know stretching from the American\nSouth east up to the northeast a ... in industries where they could rely on study jobs\nExactly and that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distress rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is a bit by Edelstein was being pushed to well what we really need or policies to address the root causes which are mental health issues and\nSo ... socio economic despair I mean there's a kid in my book who's interviewed a or one of his teachers asked them in middle school when you want to be when he grows when you grow up\nAnd he says I Want to be a draw or she goes oh you want to be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a drawer and want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around him in Lee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard it's hard to central at ... opioids were prescribe three hundred six hundred percent the the\n... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of ...\nThe hardest central at ... opioids were prescribe three hundred six hundred percent that the ... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of men who are working age there who are unemployed\nAnd recently the president has talked about the mobilization of the federal government to address the crisis on Tuesday health and Human Services secretary Alex aides are said to us is starting to turn the corner on this epidemic or she cited figure showing a to point eight percent dip in over deaths from September twenty Seventeen to march twenty Eighteen\nAccording to provisional data from the CDC the seemingly relentless trend of rising overdose deaths seems to finally be benefiting in the right direction [noise]\nTelling it such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory but the concerted efforts of communities across America are beginning to turn the tide\nBryn ... pose a you know the number of Americans dying from a ... a related deaths appears to be a ... the number of Americans in total who died in the Vietnam War but it's the secretary right are we turning the corner of it on this\nWell first of all there that's every year right so the Vietnam War was the ten year war and to you know this is every year we're losing the entire Vietnam War a and so I think it's it's such an unmitigated disaster at this point that um he's right to point at a at a potato but um if we're waiting for\nAmerica to fix it spiritual Malaysia's before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we're being derelict in our duty is and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders they want to wrestle with\nUnemployment and people's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like mayor Weinberger here in Burlington or a a chief of police um you know get down to brass tacks there are things we can do today right now besides lowering the unemployment rate that will save lives and", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018",
