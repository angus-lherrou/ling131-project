a huge turnout for early voting so what do you think that means we want to hear from you or what are you seeing from campaigns and from candidates in your state in in your district in what do you hope\nNow for early voting so what do you think that means\nWe want to hear from you or what are you seeing from campaigns in from candidates in your state in in your district in what do you hope for the outcome\nIn these midterm elections were at one eight hundred forty three eight to five five and I'm joined today by Janet Hook\nNational political reporter for the wall Street Journal and they think it's all his editor and publisher of inside elections and Nathan before the break Janet was talking about how in Florida that gubernatorial race um is garnering a lot of attention and potentially pulling a lot of people to the polls and we heard a caller say exactly that\nSo I was wondering if Florida serves as an example there are a couple of key states where\nGubernatorial races maybe yeah sort of more of the political center of gravity and who might that attracted to the polls [noise]\nYeah I think is a specifically to Florida in specifically with Gillum I mean I think his ability if he can turn out a younger voters and African American voters in the mid term the way the ... ... ... in times when Democrats have struggled to turn out those voters in midterm elections I think you can have an impact\nOf further down the ballot you know when we zooming out when we have multiple house and Senate\nYou know when we have multiple competitive races on the ballot sometimes I'm not sure which which raised with driving what but what I think it was interesting about the house in the Senate maps going back to that to America's is that there's\nActually not a ton of overlap between the competitive U.S House races and uh in the Senate map now Florida is Florida is one of the the exceptions to that where there are at least a handful of competitive house races but elsewhere\nYou know the the pockets of the places where Democrats can make big house gain such as um New York and California I mean they have ... races but they're not they're not particularly competitive\nI see well let's take a quick call here and Gary is calling from Clarkson Michigan get you're on the air\nThank you for having me on magnet thank you a panel or taking time from each day and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously what trap for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and\nNeighbor one of the counties that Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well you know one thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be\nThis consensus of white is Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously the heavy manufacturing state\nThis is a state that kinda gone through with a lot of it that deregulation that Donald Trump has gone through the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump\nAnd the state that kind of gone through with a lot of the the deregulation that Donald Trump it gone through the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so progressive guy who was in office there but I Want to ask you this question in terms of\nYou know what does potentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a blue wave coming in or what the impact and what that leads on the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in Michigan and twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the guy that lived over others proposal ballot your that will potentially\nUm you know changed the district the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats I guess in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very perplexing yea which you know not many people seem to you know talk about when it comes to a battleground\nState Garrett ... thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty\nOh for sure and actually there if there's one state of consequences that that seems poised to have a blue wave it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which were Widmer seems to have a pretty sizable um stance leading the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot\nThe incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as in the other Midwestern states that gave Trump is Marge and it was by such a narrow margin read it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm\nUp against President Trump and twenty twenty\nYeah and and as Garrett was asking uh it seems a question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what are we going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy and the next two years now that might that have an impact on uh on on Michigan an on Michigan in Michigan workers\nWell it depends a lot on what happens with the terrorists that he proposed and imposed because it's just it it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertain and he alternates between\nA talking about imposing more ... more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it probably um help stabilize the the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement\nBut um if there's one thing about Donald Trump and his policy that's safe to say it's I kinda don't know what's next for or I'm not sure I'm not sure\nNAFTA style agreement but um if there's one thing about Donald Trump and his policy that's safe to say it's I kinda don't know what's next\nFor or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think\nIf it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of if something's not working you can just turn to do one eighty and say All right we're going to we're going to do something else and when it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race the twenty twenty race in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and what is it the contrast\nBetween approaches and styles and in their view on the economy as well as how people feel like the the country's headed in the right direction when we get that far right\nYou know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races are happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting at one point radio dot org seeming welcome to the program Hi Meg Meg thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling shows how close is this race\nWell it's a very close race there's also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we could be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counts and by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election day okay\nSo this is then one of the reasons why I'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging\nVoters from the rules has become a such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned Brian ... is the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from\nLast Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta uh first of all we are going to hear from democratic candidate Stacey Abrams really a roof feuding uh Brian ... statement that he has not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rolls\nThis is a man who had someone arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot he raided the office\nIt may be some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rolls\nThis is a man who had someone who arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot he raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of oppression feed the narrative because that or suppression isn't only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worry that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidates that day state Brian Kemp said that he has quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters\nVoters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from ... rooms extreme agenda that she has for a government takeover of healthcare wanting to get a scholarship to those that are here illegally in many many other radicalization\nAs current secretary of state for Georgia Brian Kemp Steven Fowler ... give us take a

he's editor and publisher of inside elections that provides nonpartisan campaign analysis Janet Hook is also with us She's national political reporter\nFor the wall Street Journal and let's go straight to our callers that a lot of them so Leo calling from Akron, Ohio Leo you're on the air\nIf I make no thanks for taking my call [noise] um we're healthcare voters and I'm among other big top big issues I'm leading up to this election\nAnd it it's just so early ridiculous to hear these claims that these GOP lawmakers or protecting people with preexisting conditions when their votes have said just the opposite I Know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeds leading up to the election [noise]\nBut I mean you have do you have to be off the grid to not know that these people are attacking people with preexisting condition [noise]\n... thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what we said\nWell if a NATO was right in talking about how central the issue health care issue is for the Democrats and if every wondered whether or not it was an important in a winning issue there is nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue um\nIn past for the past I don't know six elections the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't come through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and\nTo the extent that there's one issue that has really broad residents for people it's the protections for people with pre existing condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided yeah the Democrats realize that and now\nThe protections for people with preexisting condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seem to be realizing it too well\nThis is playing out in so many different races across the country let's go to Nevada here where it in a debate between the candidates for Senate in Nevada uh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there\nAnd you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen a asking senator Heller to tell the Nevada family and their son whose name was dean why Heller quote broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions\nAnd he's promising to protect their health care and that what you would protect our protections for\nPre existing condition\nSo I Want to tell you what can the camera\nAnd what they want me to ask you have to look him in the eyes\nAbout why you broke his promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why you want to hurt their sons and\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against and Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions at that debate\nYou can see it in times you can say to under tribes do consider it a thousand times it's just not true I wrote I wrote the replacement bill for the Republican Florida I knew exactly what you're below what that bill includes preexisting\nCan measure how old are you are very well we'll talk in the eye and tell them to try to minimize the bond\nThat is at a debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is Megan ... she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't play radio dot org\nMegan welcome to the program Hi thanks for having me so how much is healthcare factoring into this race between senator Heller and representative Rosen\nAs you just heard during that back but but it's been a huge focal point of the race um you know like like you all are talking about earlier that something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic a first term congresswoman has been really making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down\nWe're talking about earlier this is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic or a first term congresswoman has been\nReally making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to is the fact that there was this sort of now infamous press conference that happened last summer where a Dean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressed and if it can concerns about\nThe first ... wrote peeling replace proposal that Senate Republicans have brought forward\nBut then he ended up actually voting in favor of of you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the the repeal bills and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she's run numerous ads against him accusing him of flip flopping on the Affordable CARE Act she has this as sort of memorable ad\nAttacking Heller as senator spineless featuring one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him of sort of blowing in the wind when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act so it's it's been a it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the ... and this late stage telling you\nWrite this race is still really close and you know if you if you listen to folks talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jacky Rosen should've been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was considered going into this cycle you know the most\nVulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing re election on you know facing reelection and a state that Hillary Clinton won a\nIn twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the old um but most of them within the margin of error so\nYou know everyone is expecting this to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wire so I think you know the big question and and what remains to be seeing as how this message resonates with Nevada's nonpartisan are independent voters here um you know whether they do have a significant concerns about health care and and from what we've seen health care really is a top issue\nFor voters here and about it now like all\nOf the nation Gonzales a little earlier in the air you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking for someone vulnerable so what are you seeing in Nevada\nI think I'm One of the reasons why people do have a chance to gain seats is I'm not convinced would be going to lose you began to look for much of a cold I really you know we had it as a toss we I think we've as opposed to for the whole the whole reason we're we're probably G but there are ... in the back and when my like I said you still going\nReally you know we had it as a toss we've I think we've as opposed to for the whole the whole race will probably keep it there but in in the back of my mind like you know I think he's still going to I think it's going to lose and so that matters of math but\nIf he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to Jeff Flake so open seat in Arizona\nAnd then you know that increases their ability to actually gain seats with no matter has been interesting and and plug all plugged in Nevada independent from Megan in in her boss John and in the show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone what's what struck me is how Nevada has been more of a slog for Democrats than what I expected\nYou just like well it's a Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller as a chance to be reelected there's two competitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending a Jackie raisins third district\nAnd the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats have had to spend more time and energy than moving money than they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think we are this is mid term Nevada enough presidential in mid to Nevada tends to be more Republican\nThan maybe what do you think about that\nI think that the exactly right and that's one of the interesting thing lately when sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was in twenty fourteen and which we saw\nA complete Red Wings in Nevada and Republicans swept at you know controlled all of the state's constitutional out of the legislature on the competitive how the I truly was you know a red wave which which stands in such a stark contrast to what happened in twenty sixteen um but but that point of the ...\nYou know Democrats traditionally don't perform as well", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "29"}
