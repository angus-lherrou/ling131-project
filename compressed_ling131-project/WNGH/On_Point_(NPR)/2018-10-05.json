I think that she was floral shirt she wears jewelry that says Kenny she's a she's a very very girlish person and at at the same time she is this fierce\nTenacious warrior who has been through something unacceptable and\nShe's a she's a very very girlish person and at at the same time she is this fierce tenacious warrior who has been through something ... think of all and\nI'm so difficult that I Can't actually imagine what that must have been like and get she continues\nTo choose to think the best in people and that it's mysterious to me I don't know if you're born with that sort of tenacity uh or or if you have a forced to develop it during you know at a test\nLike the one she was put through but um I think it's I think it's remarkable and and she's such she's an admirable beyond admirable person\nAlso very childish yeah uh you know in the way she deals with people in season one of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are ... and friend Titus a tries to give her a good by hug on the first day of school\nAnd best if you're a tie it is I think the\nUp some day when you're gay black man you have a candidate received like this [noise]\n[laughter]\nTruly truly funny a and\nEnduring and loving the same time there's an undercurrent oblique it in all this stuff how do you how do you look at this rather dark comedy with ...\nI ... I don't I was very concerned about that because you ... the last thing you want to do is treat is a subject as as very serious as the one\nUm that can eat the the the torture that she has undergone you don't want to treat that in any way lightly because there's nothing about it but you have to deal with it because of bad stuff happens in the world so I think it is so much of it is in the writing so the writers take care of Ninety nine percent of the work for us and\nI think it's ... it's about um in the show I I Do think there are sharp turns where you'll be making a joke about something and then\nAnd then Ninety degree turn and you're you know back to talking about the bunker and I think that's just [noise]\nI don't know I think that that that's how life is something can be a you know that fine and sunny one moment and horrible and a kind of hellish the next and and you have to navigate those times so that I went abroad answer I'm like a lot of it reflects life but it does\nWill so you ... show created by Tina Fey moved on initially for NBC and leave it was as a Robert Greenwald who's the head of entertainment I guess she was like this is great I Love it I Love your team wonderful let's sell this to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about that so\nI Do and I I think really don't know the conversations that took place\nAnd her ... let's sell this to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about\nThis right I Do and I I thankfully don't know the conversations that took place so I I get to plead ignorance but um yes it was originally slated to be on NBC and again it you know I I think it speaks to the\nDiscomfort of hey we're doing a comedy about a girl who's been underground and so you know in that clip that you heard were Titus is sending her off to school because she didn't get to complete high school friend there's something very adolescent or immature about her I mean what where would you be if you'd been held up until the age of twelve or something you know\nI'm alarmed because sometimes when McCain doesn't understand pop culture reference or doesn't understand you know the way people in two thousand Eighteen to have I'm like oh I didn't know that either and I'm I'm worried because I was not only was not in a bunker for Fifteen Years I think I'm just a little out of it\nBut I don't know what I was doing when I have gone on Instagram before you honestly honestly where I'm just like like trailing behind but um yeah I think that she is necessarily naive because about certain things because she has been her her adolescence stunted it's it's Arrested Development and she's coming out um as it [noise]\nTwenty nine year old even though I'm thirty eight in real life I never really done I think you are but she is she's you know\nI she she missed out on a lot of stuff that she's only seen for the first time now\nIn a lot of ways you guys sort of ...

I Would no I I think it's too crazy it time to avoid that\nWe played a little bit earlier a clip from bridesmaids yourself was really funny and at Times Square raunchy yeah and it ... ... uh apparently you said you shared\nA clip from bridesmaids yourself was really funny and at times quite raunchy yeah and it\n... ... uh apparently you said you shared a questions about women and comedy you gave a talk in St Louis arch way text talk and yet when he fourteen you took on the question that you'd said that you'd been asked not just by fans by reporters and the question was are women funny\nFunny yes\nSome women are funny\nIt's it's hard to have some women are tall\nSelling our shorts\nIt's like has been like to ride the train well others prefer to take the we are different [laughter]\nThey are apparently there were different from one another as what you're saying as well as from from the\nRight I think I Know women are different from one in that in that I ... I Am talking about women are all sorts of different things and and no not one group of of people is always going to be funny or not funny\nToo but I mean you you actually were inspired to give a talk on the basis of you know a meta question from Puerto Rico's yet you know on these tours I assume you have to have a lot of questions right so hopefully saw them less meat than others\nBut I I think that is that when bridesmaids came out I think okay well that is I don't know for reporters have a conference of what happens but the fact is like okay we're going to talk about the fact that they made a movie that was successful and yet it's still just women and I think that was so that was the question that was in the water okay we are so women can be funny but\nI have to be honest\nI never had a thought that women weren't funny I ... I think it was based on the box office success and bridesmaids that that uh it demonstrated studios you can make\nA a very funny comedy starting all women and they don't make money so on that side of course it's great that that was successful financially but this idea and it's and it's asked by men and women that um you know are women funny is so stupid because it what are you talking about yeah they always been funny\nAnd he went after a delay Christopher Hitchens who knows the noted British an intentional controversial as he actually wrote this thing for Vanity Fair saying essentially obviously women are not funding they don't need to be a ... that's something that you encountered when you were trying now for for things I mean in in two thousand so that's still a thing\nI never encountered that and I know some women have an ... an improv\nWe're trying now for for things I mean in in two thousand so that's still a thing\nI never encountered that and I know some women have an ... in improv I think and I said at the last of it are citizens brigade theater and the people's improv theater I never ever encountered any unfairness or hostility because I was a woman I think that a lot of that stuff comes from when I have encountered it it's from um [noise]\nListen if the white guys in other industries [laughter] who are seen support like I got a lot of emails from uh some people I went to college with who who work maybe in the financial sector who who were impressed at the movie it was funny I thought get out of my inbox because what's funny and they were the fact that they were surprised\nMany furious because I you know it but it also reminded me that not everyone\nThinks the way my my uh comedy friends and I think [laughter] which is that there's it's not an issue that someone is in a sketch or is in a movie or is in a TV show because they're either funny or they're not\nUnder bucks and congrats on the fact that apparently white guys can sometimes make money back that yes [laughter] sometime you work with some real giants here as we mentioned you work with Tina Fey admitted killing a Christian wig a\nOh what did you what did you what do you take from working with somebody like Tina Fey who really has sort of I think public we tried to articulate how she's tried to model things for women comedians would be like you know you got to be tough and you got to stand up for what you believe what did you take from working with her\nThat what you just said which is on most of my um most of the I guess I Would say lessons I learned from Santa Fe or just by watching her because that woman lead by example and she doesn't complain and she works tirelessly and and and she treats everyone fairly and kindly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "05"}
