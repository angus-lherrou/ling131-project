welcome back to a point things haven't they you know I think this movie because it's\nWilkinson film critic for vox illicit will come back to a point thanks for having me\nYou know I think this movie because it's a depicting such a momentous momentous period in American and human history people are reading all sorts of things into it so I mean what's your take on it it is it a good movie\nAnd walk on July twenty Nineteen sixty nine and now there's a new movie out of that largely focused on Neil Armstrong and it's based on the book first man the life of Neil Armstrong which has been written by James Hansen he's a former NASA historian and professor emeritus of history at Auburn\nUniversity a professor hands and I just want to hear a little bit from Neil Armstrong himself here because it back in two thousand five\nHe gave an interview to sixty minutes I spoke with reporter at Bradley and Bradley had asked Armstrong at one point of this interview about the confidence that Armstrong portrayed when he gave a big thumbs up to assigned to the media shortly before um the Saturn five and the Apollo eleven mission took off\n[noise] yeah but it's a little bit of a sham I've unless you know the reality is a lot of times you get up in the cockpit says something was wrong somewhere to go back down actually asked you to lift off to truly replace [laughter]\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand and five a Jim Hansen you eat when you're writing your book in the movie explores again who Neil Armstrong was as a man his character his demeanor and there's a ... in the book where\nYou write about why Armstrong was picked to be the first man to step on them and and not Buzz Aldrin and and if I got to have to ask if I had this right Chris craft to is the chief of flight operations in Houston said\nUh that Neal was Neal calm quiet and absolute confidence we all knew he was the Lindbergh type he had no ego meaning what\nWill they knew that [noise] that the the person who are not just commanded the Apollo and mission but more importantly in the sense of who was going to become this global like on the one who stepped out and represent demanded to use the first step onto another heavenly body\nBut this was going to be a big deal to him they imagined that correctly and uh there was a private meeting between Chris craft and ... ... strong core and torch low who was a one of the big officials in the manned space program ... who was the director down in Houston\nIt was a very private conversation in fact it's this is you don't find isn't any records only an oral history coming from Kraft\nUm and and that was that they were having a discussion they they knew that this was going to be\nA big deal and uh you know to the public what they said was that the person going out first asked Ron going out first would be based on really be interior way out of the ... the way the hatch opened waved to asked Ross\nThe person going out for the aspirin going out first would be based on really the interior lay out of the limb to weigh the hatch opened the way the two astronauts were position inside the ...\nAnd that always was what NASA told the public and even told the astronaut says to the reason why they had ... and you'll go out for us because we had to open it would be difficult proposed to be the first one out\nBut in truth this you know this meeting was really what the decision was based on and that was\nA they knew that Neal was the type of personality that they felt would actually um you know because it could serve as this icon I mean there was a lot of public public relations in a sense to what a you know NASA was doing with the Apollo program and they wanted the right kind of representative for\nFor this and so it was not just a statement about Armstrong a\nBut it was also kind of a comment on buses I mean they knew Buzz Aldrin quite well and they knew he was a very very professional astronaut\nBut they also knew that personality wise you know bus was quite a bit different than the all he was very extroverted he was\nYou know if he were there was an element of narcissism and buzz honestly\nUh and they are some commanders in fact when I interviewed Frank Borman who's the commander of Apollo aid\nForm and made it very clear to me that he had told 'em ... that he would not accept those on his crew and it wasn't because he wasn't again on a professional astronaut they were just elements of buzz personality which were a little difficult\nAnd Neal could handle them a man and buzz and he worked together quite well but they just felt that if you know between these two men there was no question in their mind that Armstrong ... would be the perfect next ... a loon bird and buzz would be much more problematic\nAnxious think well let's step back in time considerably if we could uh I mean tell us about a Neil Armstrong's younger years they hear that did you first start flying at the age of six\nAnd he took his at first airplane ride laid right okay I was sick I ain't got his pilot's license on his sixteenth birthday before he even\nTried to drive an automobile he had little interest in automobiles to\nWhich is kind of surprising for a boy back in that era but he had become very passionate about airplanes as a small boy he bought he had his mommy saved every penny from everything you did to buy a model airplanes that he built in in flight magazines of various kinds and uh\nAnd so it was really the passion for airplanes and flying you know in later after he becomes first man and becomes this iconic figure um some biographers\nLater after he becomes first man and becomes this iconic figure um some biographers or you can read this and a lot of the children's books that have been written about him suggested Neal was\nYou know looked at the stars and big into telescopes and read science fiction and all that really none of that's true I mean you don't need to get interested in that until much later he was really all about airplanes and what happened was his career\nYou know he may as a pilot going to Purdue University just to become an aircraft designer\nUm you know becoming a naval aviator the flu and Korea than becoming a test pilot he really led him to space was really not any you know terminal passion on his part as a as a boy but really just sort of the\nThe wave of technology at in in flight as was progressing from jets to rockets and right out of the atmosphere and he just went with it\nWell in your book you write about how um he loved flying so much I think he told you that when he was a young boy he would dream about it at night that he had this recurring dream of holding his breath and hovering over the ground that he was either and they're flying or or or didn't fall but he was just hovering in history\nHe he did have that story and what was really a interesting about it was he was very reluctant to tell it to me because he didn't you know he was not the sort of person who really you know um [noise] I mean there was a spiritual side to him but he wasn't the sort of person who\nWho would emphasize you know the element of dreams for example in who he was or what he became and so he had this recurring dream and so he admitted to it but it was it was almost embarrassed to do it because he you know I think he ended the story to me by saying well I I don't think you want to make too much of that you know\nUh so he was a very practical minded guy and and and even as a boy was type of type of proto engineer looked at things\nThat he was saying like profoundly go a goal oriented very ambitious because\nYou write about how you were saying they said a minute ago but it wasn't necessarily some sort of a passion for space in space exploration ... drove him but that all the great aviation accomplishments had already been done any kind of resented that and it was space that was the next step\nYeah that was a you know he'd growing up in the thirties and they were still lots of first that were happening in terms of violating an aviation and of course reading all those um flight magazines as a boy and and building all those models he was aware of the great\nPioneering flights of that era of the post or the pre World War two era\nBuilding all those models he was aware of the great pioneering flight so bad ear of the post or the pre World War two era any kind of thought as a boy well everybody's got those done and and now what's next [laughter] of course he didn't realize that there are all sorts of things yet to come\nAnd well so campaigns and I want to talk with you in some detail about an area of Neil Armstrong's life that the movie focuses on quite a bit and that's the death of\nHis two year old daughter Karen I'm so first of all let's let's just play

book upon which the new movie starring Ryan Gosling is based in that movie is also called first man and just before the break Jim Hansen was reminding us of of course those immortal words one small step for man one giant leap for mankind it that Neil Armstrong said when he first step foot on the moon\nIn two thousand five to sixty minutes Armstrong explained what was going through his mind at the moment\nHe said that those words\nI thought well when I step off I'm just going to be a little steps as we step they're founded there but then I thought about all those four hundred thousand people that are given me the opportunity to make that staff at the [noise]\nGoing to be a big something for all those folks and then the a lot of others that even were involved in the projects so it was a kind of a simple correlation thoughts\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand and five and how remarkably understated is he James Hansen's saying yeah I kinda thought it was going to be something big for people who weren't even involved in that kind of a simple correlation saving is he really ...\nYou love that phrase simple correlation I mean that that that comes from an engineer I think it is\nBut uh yeah I mean as I said and one thing that I I get this question a lot you know did he come up with that phrase long before they landed meals answer always was that he you know there was some chance they weren't going to land I mean there were lots of things that had to go right before they actually could\nLand in why think about what you're going to say when you step out if you're not even going to do it so he you know he told me and he's told everyone you told everyone is whenever he was asked if he didn't really come up with the phrase until after they had landed and they had a few you know there were a few hours before they to get ready ensued up and it meant that he can\nHe was asked that he didn't really come up with the phrase until after they had landed and they had a few you know there were a few hours before they try to get ready ensued up and then if that he composed it in his head while you know after the landing yeah very close\nTo say I mean it was he supposed to say one small step for man\nWell that's what he thought he did say into you know to his dying day that's what he thought and there's actually been a lot of the ... been done by different experts to see and I I was actually at a Smithsonian demonstration were NASA officials are and they knew back in two thousand four I think it was\nAnd then there was an Australian acoustics a guy who played uh and and he had evidence he thought\nThat in the electronic register of the the sound waves or that you could you saw something there that was apparently an attempt to make the aid but it was an audible so I don't know I mean there's no way really I don't think to resolve this completely Neal\nNeal in the middle way told me said well just put the AM parentheses\nWell Jim Hansen hold on here for just a second because I have to say this this moment\nAh for those people who witnessed the launching of the Saturn ... rocket who saw those grainy TV images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon and also by the way we should note Michael collins as well\nUh orbiting around the moon alone has Armstrong and Aldrin were on the lunar surface it really left a as just a lasting impact on the millions of people\nWho remember it because something totally delightful happened to us this morning we uh got an email out of the blue from Maria lanes she's in Watertown, Massachusetts 'cause she had heard of one of our our little promos that we were going to talk to you today about Neil Armstrong says Maria send us email out of the blue\nAnd along with some pictures that she took in Hawaii when um\nWhen the Apollo eleven crew returned to earth and it's just such a wonderful story at that we've invited Murray to be on the show with us as she joins us now real welcome to on point\nI'm magnet thank you so much it's it's my great pleasure it'd be with you\nIt is wonderful to have you and I want everyone to go to on point radio dot org and check out these photographs that Maria sent us because there are these beautiful black and white pictures\nOf the what the air stream of a light a vehicle that uh Armstrong an older than Collins we're in after they came back to earth what were you doing in Hawaii first of all what happened on that day\nA vehicle that uh Armstrong an older than college were in after they came back to earth what were you doing in in Hawaii first of all what happened on that day\nWell I was visiting my uncle Frank uh who and his family we were very close and um I was Thirteen and he was on heck um air force base is commander of a large see one twenty four cargo plane and that was during Vietnam of course\nThe Vietnam War yeah ah so um we were we got word that the NASA mobile quarantine facility a streamlined trailer a would be traveling behind my uncle's house with the astronauts after they touched down in the ocean and were picked up by a ship\nUh-huh I see the pictures that you sent us a there's one in particular we we see you and your uncle standing there with with the uh the streamlined trailer going by and there's another photograph were Buzz Aldrin is in the window and kinda waving at\nYou yes yes [laughter] and the\nFeeling was you know that he was just overjoyed to be home I mean yeah it was a giant step for mankind and they actually returned from the moon\nYeah well so all these years later a Maria ... why is it to that you still feel such like a powerful residents to to that moment [noise]\nWell uh you know I'm Still astonished at the courage of the astronaut their families the ingenuity of the enormous team that made it all happened\nA and there was some discussion about the movie and uh the book um and that they went up in this space capsule that looks like you know maybe a little bit rickety compared to that today's sophisticated spaceships\nIt looked like a tin can be perfectly honest [laughter] exactly exactly yeah so it's\nStill so so moving and I'm so astonishing\nWell Maria lean from Watertown, Massachusetts a thank you so much for getting on the phone with us and thank you for sending us those remarkable photographs were going to share them with everyone who wants to see them on point radio dot org\nAgain it's images that Maria took in Hawaii of the mass NASA mobile quarantine unit the streamlined trailer with Buzz Aldrin waste from the window after you'd returned from the moon Maria thank you so much\nOh thank you I'm so thrilled well let's go now to Margot who's calling from Portland Maine Margot you're on the air\nI ...
