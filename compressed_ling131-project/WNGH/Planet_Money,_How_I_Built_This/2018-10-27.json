a podcast called twenty\nRaw foods are kind of amazing and it just never had occurred to me and then I went back to Colorado over Memorial Day weekend to visit one of my dearest and all his friends and um [noise] I went hiking and\nI was just kind of eating a trail mix and thinking of food and raw foods and thinking about moving to Seattle and all of a sudden I'm On this mountain in this label goes off for me and I think\nWhy isn't somebody made something of fruit that some spices like\nSomething very just pure simple real foods but it's portable inconvenient but it tastes indulgent like shouldn't be eating it like don't junk food I mean I don't know that day at that moment\nWas like this surge of energy I got I could feel this excitement over an idea it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around every day with ideas for whatever reason and bad day and that time and all those little experience\nIt did it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around every day with ideas for whatever reason and bad day in that time and all those little experiences that built tough I I just felt did\nWhat you do did you like run home and and and in certain like writing things down or drawing pictures or or did you just kind of model referral for a while so\nI ran down the mountain I got it a new book and I started writing\nDown ideas and then when we got back to Denver to spot and how can they take for not some spices and turn them into something really exciting and I would get ideas from pies and cookies and cakes and I think okay how\nDo I take in cherry pie and make it just in my quiz and art and basically a raw raw and processed food and\nMake it tastes like cherry pie or apple pie or banana bread or what have you\nKnow I'm just imagining this because I Do a lot of cooking and you're in your kitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like nuts in there and it's going to get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like between like ... all of a mass\nAnd then you would like take it out with your hands and be like a roll it out with a rolling ten and then\nUm I got to cut her and they would like to cut her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean a batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own mature many cash digital sort of ask you parse to help you out in a year while you were not you know we're getting a salary how did you pay your bills\nUm within about a week I realized\nOh I I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought I mean to start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know\nSo whole foods opened their first store in Denver at exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and the and in the neighborhood I grew up and actually and I thought\nI'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work in their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out that this is how it works\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the ...\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself is really going to be the big deal like this people walk by these\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression so I first got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say\nI Would buy those and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world I mean to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or she's going to work for a whole foods they don't just do that\n[noise] and just just to clarify again our you just like sort of funding\nThis and it's like finding greens and stuff and and this was when using your own money [noise] you know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious little I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really\nGung ho and I would get all kinds of grain information in a month would go by and I would find out about a piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things\nAnd I would be motivated and somebody want to buy bars and I make them at a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags and a little Chinese takeout box\nAnd and I would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box of bars and I would think wow and then another month ago by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and\nThen I Would just get really I'm motivated and nothing happened and this went on for the three year period between my idea phase and when I actually launched\nI Am trying to figure out how you uh maintained your uh your optimism and confidence about all this 'cause I mean you're thirty two you're divorced\nAnd I imagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of this plan and I don't well I was part of you I mean did you ever get the feeling that people like you and I think I had Laura she's got the kind of weird ... project\nA lot of people thought that I mean I Would see people I went to high school with and they would\nYou uncover think I had like Laura she's got the kind of weird side project a lot of people thought that I mean\nI Would see people I went to high school with and they would come into whole foods and you know they had their dirty climbing the ladder big jobs in finance and all kinds of things and they say oh\nI didn't know you worked here and and people would see me and even if I had those moments where people were ... I Would notice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life and you have to go for it and embrace it and make it happen [noise]\nWhen we come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen project into a business [noise]\nStay with us I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR in [noise]\nIn less than two weeks is deeply divided nation is heading to the polls to vote in the battleground state of Pennsylvania residents of Gettysburg say it's time to remember\nHistory and we don't focus more on civility in this day in time we're moving closer and closer toward another civil war if we're not careful\nWhere in Pennsylvania to hear what on voters' minds next time on all things considered from NPR News joined us for all things considered this afternoon it by ... an online a gp news dot org\nIs diamond was Papadopoulos I'm the medical director of metro term Metrodome is a dermatology slash terminal logic surgical practice in Atlanta with your team providers I wanted to participate and underwriting for public radio\nThe integrity of what I was listening to made me feel like I wanted to be part of a message and that represented us\nAnd there was something very positive about going\nTo find out more about becoming a corporate sponsor emails sponsorship at gp dot org\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial well being first learn more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from Tara data working to transform how businesses work through the power of data using pervasive data intelligence Tara data leverage is all relevant data to deliver answers to complex business issues Tara data dot com\nWill come back to how I built this from NPR\nSullivan data to deliver answers to complex business issues Tara data dot com\nWill come back to how I built this from NPR I'm Kyrah so it's two thousand one large American is working at whole foods in Denver and she's trying to figure out how to start a company but she doesn't have a whole lot of money and she doesn't have any professional equipment\nOr even a way to process and package her energy bars so eventually I went to a packaging company in Denver and they weren't even taken me seriously and later saying to them he said hey how do I make this them in a bigger scale I said I Need packaging and then they they look at me and go huh\nI mean they couldn't take me seriously didn't even have a business you want it you were looking for somebody to ... who had food grade packaging that package or bar shifts and and meanwhile back at home you're you're still using a Cuisinart\nYes she's in the ... I was trying to find a giant Cuisinart I was trying to ... I didn't even know what that was called is called the vertical cutter mixture I learned and\nAnd then that led to some guy that had a piece of manufacturing equipment that low and behold was the exact thing that I needed the the the queen ... and that's how it all kind of piece together yeah\nAnd and by the un raise some money now and raised in resenting okay I wrote a story I wrote a business plan my dad helped me write a business plan [noise] I had a few friends and family interested and\nI was going to launch in fall of two thousand two [noise] and that got delayed until April of two thousand three and during that time all of my interested friends and family backed out\nLike because they got called the face it was yeah it was just getting to late so would you do well I had to had to raise the money and my dad had decided he would lead he wanted to get involved in the company", "show_name": "Planet Money, How I Built This", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "27"}
