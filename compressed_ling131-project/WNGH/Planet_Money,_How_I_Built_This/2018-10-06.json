Georgia Public broadcasting\nYou're listening to Planet Money so so you know how to milk the cow by hand oh yeah oh yeah you know\n... spent his summers as a kid working on his grandparents dairy farm in Wisconsin\nAnd do you still in the dairy world he is now a dairy economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably or you know close to a hundred percent are able to Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have before we started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rest and Andy had a ringside seats to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away it was\nNineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started floating this idea\nOf a bomb on them\nWhen I was\nOne of the ways Carter proposed giving farmers in equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nYeah it certainly was on the edge of that there was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect that it would actually fulfill\nSo a campaign promise that's what we call those yeah there you go\nThis was not just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own food because they are farmers go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food then that is a kind of national security risk\nIs our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what any of its new is it it's one thing to provide stability is another to step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk is going up more than six cents a gallon so it's going up because the government\nYou you hear of it and he likes back your forehead oh boy here we go it was pretty ...\nIn six cents a gallon to just going up because the government and you you hear of it and he likes back your forehead oh boy here we go it was pretty hard to predict that it would just as bad as it got much every instinct I had said oh the ... going to work out so well\nExactly so the thing that the government was concerned about is what's called commercial displacement\nAgain economist Andy ... and he says the government could not just released a flood of surplus cheese onto the market because it would crush she's producers\nYou can imagine the the cheese company that's in the business selling shoes is going to say there was a deal here you took away my customers is important to me\nSo that leaves a couple of options you could destroy the surplus but that looks pretty bad\nOr you can try to get your surplus goods to people who were not going to buy it anyway and that you won't be flooding anyone's markets when we have a surplus of grain or Sawyer even powdered milk\nWe can send that stuff overseas as part of foreign aid but she's just doesn't travel well so the government gave a bunch to schools than to the army but this was not putting even a dent in the surplus so they created a brand new special program to give the cheese away through food bank\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much\nBut the problem Andy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound ... so\nYou can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose what you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like bricks\nAnd this is what people will remember as government cheese [laughter] because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese\nBricks and this is what people will remember as a government cheese because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThing great changed giveaway began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus\nThis footage one is amazing style massive crowds of people being handed the rec than at times with the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard some black USDA stamps or\nState official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nThis moment that governments she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the caves full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food bank and schools military medals\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became\nWe're ready for you many listeners may remember Saturday Night live match fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nHere I'm not getting any government cheese\nGovernments she starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture a short story by Junot Diaz clear the government chief from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of songs\nWe bought\nGet we get like a lot of them was something that she\nMay be government cheese that most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook stuff with\nFather had if I\nWould change is all government\nShe became a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair was process cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than belt I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're here to not ... but I'll tell you the the government process move was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed\nIt was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat boards trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it at one\nPoint Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nParents doing the dance ... doing the\nDance strain but here is why government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nWay\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough\n[noise] well I think there's there's two basic lessons again economist Andy ... which one is it's really hard to balance\nWhat you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that off the record\nVery very expensive she's been to the government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nThe thing about price controls is that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we get this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nIs a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk one part of the solution then was to gently get that milk supply down to persuade farmers\nAnd so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk one part of the solution then was two jet Li get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk like hey people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk [laughter]\nWe took a a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... years old and we've created the national dairy board but this was what gave us a you know the got milk and the ... mustache and all those kind of conduct programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension for these days if the government wants to help farmers what you'll generally here about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the the government has\nTended to stay away from buying cheese of pollution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the eight of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies that Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again and then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like schools and food\nBanks got to be fair that's probably not enough to start filling caves with again but they're given a chance to government maybe in the business of government [noise]\nOkay [noise]\nEpisode is produced by electing where we've got the big mountain and rain and going back to providing producer is Alex told mark ... editor is brand or is that\nI'm Karen Duffin I'm Kenny Malone\nOkay rise with coming up next time you're out there today I had built this really mad at the guy who founded the company\nNext on your show today I've had built is really the magic the guy who founded the company which\nI have heard of it yeah I see his shoes everywhere right but even when\nHe was a household name Steve Madden what convinced that he made the cut I'm not one of those odd to print or is that thought he was going to be super successful you know I was just try to survive and I'm very negative very pessimistic unlike maybe some of the guys that you've done\nYou know the shows yet total I'm sure they got that you know that they're going to give me down to me I have gone out of business every other day [noise]\nInnovators entrepreneur\nOn guy ... show\nTry and design them low in prices\nAttorney's name three billion dollars ... [noise]\n[noise] All right so you've got this pretty good business going in year one what do you think you know you're thinking okay I mean did you have ambitions at that point all ready to make this into something here\nSo when I'm Out as I started the business and do you not just that really don't have much money I'm just sort of working hand to mouth and a friend of mine who I grew up with went to work for this brokerage firm and they were raising money for small companies\nTo says Donnie ... Danny ... yeah\nAnd uh you know we're going to race you are going to get you\nWill raise you six hundred grand and to and he said to you hey you need to expand your line really talented I've known you my whole life you know what would you do if you got six hundred thousand yeah and you know hundred thousand it was like six hundred million to me and then he said well not only will I get your six hundred grand\nYou know what would you do if you got six hundred thousand yeah and you know hundred thousand was like six hundred million to me yeah and then he said well not only will I get your six hundred grand but I'm going to get your six million dollars when I take your book and I laugh get him you know because I thought he had thirty thousand dollars in my to my ...\nAnd so of course you're like what thirty three thirty something like that yeah and you're thinking you can raise me six hundred thousand bucks that's right so the right and so so so Danny ... help you go yeah and he helped me go public and his bottom\nWas called strap no mine a very famous same for anybody who's seen the little philosophy ring yeah [noise]\nJordan fell for the year I turned twenty six I'm forty nine million dollars would\nFive million a week [noise]\nActually should explains friend of mine was just like a cul de dum dum for yeah they used to call them ... and they were basically hell he would tell really crappy companies they would ... get subsidized jacked up later so all the shares make tons of money I Would lose their stress and so they\nBasically were wanting to do this with Steve Martin right they want it to do it with the managers of the perfect guy for them because because you don't have a company and it was small and they could do their thing with it you know it fit the profile\nThough if\nYou don't know me ah\nAnd we know you are as far as that scene and\nWith me talking in front of the ... it was very accurate we should explain for people who haven't seen it you you go up in front of all these um these like traitors and this ... year I started talking about my shoes thinking that they would really be interested really weren't I was just a piece of it was just a piece of paper and a piece of meat marry they could sell which is really\nWant to digress for [noise] people\nFor this budding entrepreneurs I'm not one of those entrepreneur is that that thought he was going to be\nSuper successful you know I was just trying to survive and I'm very negative very pessimistic unlike maybe some of the guys that you've done you know the show yet total I'm sure they got that you know they're they're gonna be I can get me down to me I think I'm going out of business every other day\nThe strengthened sail goes the company goes public ... public yeah all of a sudden it raises how much\nYeah I think I'm going out of business every other day\n... sales go to the company goes public ... public yeah all of a sudden it raises how much money for you I think the public offering was about seven million bucks wow so\nWe use it I I took it and then very short period of time from a half a million bucks I was doing forty million a year fifty million and and what is it that way there within thirty six months\nCredible so okay you get all this cash from from the initial public offering yeah\nA ... and in fact I mean did you ask any questions I mean\nThese guys were uh they were totally breaking the law I mean there at that point they were artificially inflate in your stocks did you like like where you suspicious at all about Danny and about Stratton I mean did you did you think hey you know one of these guys do it\nI knew it was too good to be true yeah I Know and so I was greedy and foolish\nYears I'm trying to figure out you are just creative guy create choose you design issues\nAnd you've got a really successful and grilling business and then on the side you're doing this these weird stock trades that you are shady and only lady ultimately not illegal why would you even do that stuff on the side you know already have the creativity in and out because you just [noise]\nYou just get caught up\nBut it is a certain point it can't be about money it has to be about fulfillment and and\nWeren't you fulfilled by just the creation of your shoes and and seeing their shoes out in the world [noise]\nWell that's a very heavy question [noise]\nOne gets fulfilled [noise]\nWe're still grappling with that today you know so there are moments\nWhere I'm very fulfilled you know and there are moments when I'm not I was raised to think that money was everything you know money is the center of the universe\nAnd if that's what your core beliefs days you know you'll do anything and you break the law you know if I could money's like a drug\nTesty
