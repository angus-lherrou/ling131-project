B. and the service we provide every day\nYou're listening to Planet Money the other day I had an early morning interview and I ran downstairs to get a cup of coffee and ran into the guest so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of started her\nMaybe we should say uh where are you\nHot cats I'm Sorry I don't know mine you wanting to get my name is yeah [laughter]\nThe easy question I'm Catherine Rampell him at home instead of watching\nThe typically captured writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect place to show this thing that he was furious [noise]\nSo you're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nI can see\nOn the board\nA little misleading\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it\nWith Catherine sees here is one price on the board\nAnd then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it and it's not just taxes sometimes it's bees and service charges\nThat seemed to appear out of thin air at checkout and drive us all crazy\nLooking rental cars buying concert tickets for like have you looked at a hotel room recently sometimes\nThere's an Internet the symptoms of the parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that is not a resort hit by the way anyway Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompany should be competing based on price and quality and not up to station a and the fact that companies to compete on opposition is not create a better economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that are buying stuff that they don't want\nEveryone has a used car salesman [laughter]\nGot better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that are buying stuff that they don't want if everyone has a used car sales are very good friend who's a used car sales so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nMajor league baseball knows that it's games are a little too long and so they've been trying their own tweaks to speed up the game little things like limiting the number of warm up pitch is making the commercial breaks between innings shorter and that's all fine but if they really wanted to speed the game up\nThey would be a little more serious about listening to tweak proposed by this man\nUh my name is David ... professor of politics at New York university you like baseball fan a rapid fan [noise] no\nNot one who is willing to blindly follow all rules of baseball I suppose yeah\nI Know I propose some reforms\nSteve and some colleagues have proposed what is now known as the catch up rule yeah light guy you want to catch up on my stood on that guy is not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up Steve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catch a pro\nBaseball it works is follows that if you're the team ahead in ing and urine bat then you get only two outs rather than three out in that inning\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances Steve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nLooked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand\nWe went back to Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyze a each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the catch ... been in place how things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter with these games are dead the average game which now has three hours and five\nThings have changed as an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter with these games are better than the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost half an hour from a game one hour he was the\nGame yes and not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance so\nHow have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime [noise] well a critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there had been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest\nIn fact he tells us he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nSo yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd be them only Eighteen seconds at the end of a game home\nLike how you are a true iconoclast wear out [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much and don't go to any baseball games anytime soon you might get better yeah long odds thrown at you\nIs there a tweak that you would like to the\nYou can email it to us we're Planet Money at\nDust or gee we're also at Planet Money on the twitters and instead you're so have\nAlex ... is our supervising producer Ryan or set is our\nChief episode tweezers I'm Kenny Malone and I'm ...\nAnd\nWe have one more extra special guest joining us

got\nNever say no to a hostage taker manual eliminates opposite the only option that leads to shoot someone understands it gets that sort of makes sense\nEver say no to a hostage taker it's been the

amazingly resilient businessmen who's organic yogurt company had its share of near death experiences on many occasions\nI Would tip toe over to the office to call my mother in law to have a chance to

I think it's a fairly safe to say that stony field yogurt and has had more ups and downs and really more down then just about any other ... and it's pretty unlikely tail to be you know in ...\nTo ... hippie farmers with no real desire to build a company wind up building a company\nThey start small milking their own cows making their own yogurt selling locally to nuns and then eventually spreading themselves way too thin and sliding into deep dad you know over the years don't he killed his headache laws slew of near death experiences\nBut it never quite guided in fact it grew it grew into one of the most popular yogurt brand in the United states\nAnd one thing about starting killed cofounder of Gary ... is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company he knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire his dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days there were probably fifty shoe manufactures and New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont\nAnd so how many people did your dad's company employs several\nInsurers and New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so how many people did your dad's company employ\nSeveral thousand I think at their peak they were twenty eight hundred\nWow he's are true company towns of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in the region in the country were were built on things that we made\nThe dark side of that is that when they think because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed you know all these communities did as well [noise]\nAnd what happened to your family [noise]\nUh well it was really a three a free for the family's business uh went bankrupt or my parents got divorced\nAnd my uh\nSort of childhood role model a died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a\nIt was a wake up here ... yeah I um my father I got a began drinking um [noise] and so I had to sort of confront all of that and yeah you know my mom became a single mom with five kids I was the oldest so dislike\nAnd then I went out to our lenders\nHave the hundred and twenty five gay\nI said look I'm Will you take stock in this company and we did our first private placement [noise]\nYou know through a dart at the wall figured out the value of the business for ... what is your value but at the time\n[laughter] well we thought we were going to evaluate it at a million dollars but then in Nineteen eighty four our sales were up to around two hundred fifty thousand a year and this is just in in New Hampshire or all over New England well\nBy eighty four we were starting to push the boundaries were selling to about twenty stores and eventually we started selling to a an independent grocers seven stores and uh\nThis will give you the real flavor for this uh what was going on just a one Sunday night were having dinner at the Caymans after ... and the phone rings and a ... the nephew of the owner of the ... market basket chained ... calls and says ...\nAnd the phone rings and a ... the nephew of the\nOwner of the militias market basket and chained calls and says Samuel or why are you telling them my competitors not to me that he had thirty four stores at the time is up and say well to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cows East that will get some more\nCows than he slammed the phone down and we took that as very good business advice\nSo we went out and grew are hurt even further and then so we\nNow realize we needed to get serious about this and so we managed\nTo lease a small refrigerator truck and started\nDelivering actually to the market basket where warehouse how much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing now about Mm three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt and a case of like twenty four cups six ... six packs of court and so by the end of eighty four\nWe were are run rate was headed\nIn the sort of half a million dollar range but you were\nProbably spending more money than you are bringing in right\nOh my God you have no idea yeah we were burning I mean I kept not weekly cash was not daily casualty I kept hourly cash plus yeah I knew on a Wednesday morning how much money had to come in that afternoon in order for us because by then the guy had figured out\nWho you know send me I wasn't paying them so now we're on very short terms with everybody I mean my fundraising skills turn out to be you know I mean we'd be nowhere without Samuels yogurt making skills and his family's unbelievable\nAttention to detail they were perfectionist but we were also we would also be nowhere without my ability to keep getting credit and cash because it was burning [noise] I mean we were on him [noise]\nWhen we come back in just a moment out Gary and Daniel bags and borrowed to keep stony field going and how they almost lost it anyway again\nAnd again and again I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I felt this from NPR [noise]\nThis week on the Georgia health report we take a look at access to mental health services and how does

NPR I'm Guy Raj so in the summer of Nineteen eighty four Gary and Samuel ends stony field are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nIn those days a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little pre store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part a hopeless and they had one store in Cambridge prospects drink and you know we were selling now to Melissa market basket this is now I'm Talking July of eighty four\nAnd um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we can crack\nBread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to ... in the TPP with their ... do you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in a hamster [laughter]\nWhat did you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate\nOrganic yogurt from some crazy people in the hamster\n[laughter] to what you guys do\nSo in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at the farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus I'm prospects in Cambridge and asked for my yogurt that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Merrick Harold Skinner the buyer bread and circus called is that Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof\nWere getting all kinds of requests for yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first delivery that afternoon I'm about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circus and awfully went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles as last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get people's miles and then they're going to ask\nFor it and and this is running around the time you meet Meg he would become your wife right yeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no sometime for northeast organic farming association conference and I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and uh right after I finished my speech this very\nAdorable or organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there I waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg\nAnd her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state so she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter]\nI started raising and I I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later ... well I think we can increase so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm as because they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some harbored MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money huh yeah yeah and so\nMight just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money huh yeah yeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful oh yeah you know what happened\nIn this farm house I always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAt and but at this point I was a half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking ... was a sleep in our bedroom which was about fifty feet from my office I Would\nOn many occasions tip toe over to the office to call my mother in law\nTo have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty five hundred to make ends meet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law is on and make was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because I was because she didn't have confidence and then they will look she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires\nWe had the well pump would go out the the power would I mean we are on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere was make things do you listen to ditch the thing that's bag\nIt I mean or or did she gives it sounds like she maybe he didn't believe in it [noise]\nWell she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in and did you think you are what two three years into this thing\nAnd not only are you not making money you are in debt big ... big time\nYeah [noise] well I'll say this I'm Meg or you know fortunately loved me even more forcefully probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere else to go [noise]\nYou know she had given up for a job down on her farm in New Jersey has signed on to this crazy them enterprise but here's where the story is I Know that you think it couldn't get worse but as as a Lily Tomlin
