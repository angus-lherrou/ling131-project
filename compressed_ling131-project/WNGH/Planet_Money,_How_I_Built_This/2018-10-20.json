Malone and um he'll ... he'll showman journalism professor at NYU documentary filmmaker and uh we've asked you here to join us today because I feel like it's fair to see become mildly obsessed with the topic of today's show\nThat might be some truth to that um look I'm a journalism professor I think a lot about a worry a lot about fake news and my generally I'm really concerned about trust on the Internet and it came to us and said uh before\nThere was fake news before there was a possibility of like fake video and fake audio\nThe world was dealing with a different fake problem yes fake online reviews people have been posting dishonest online fake reviews for years yeah and and this is becoming such a huge problem because like you know I go on line to\nBuy a hover board and I don't know if this report has five stars because it is awesome and I'm On a cruise around town looking cool or if it has five stars because someone is making up those reviews and in fact when I take it home it's going to set my house on fire [noise]\n... is here with a glimmer of hope for us [noise]\nAnd the glimmer of hope it's coming from it totally unexpected place\nOnline body building community today on the\nShow the story of one weightlifter battling fake reviews on his own website and what happened when he took on Amazon dot com [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Charles Schwab when it comes to wealth management Schwab believes in asking questions and being engaged so investors can better own there tomorrow learn more at Schwab dot com and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nA couple of things to know about Tommy Noonan he lives in Reno nevada he likes to juggle weird things\nSo just you know I'll be like in the grocery store and I'll have like an avocado and de onion and a a bottle of water\nThat's high stakes dropping off Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah the story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews against around two thousand six Tommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen\nYeah yeah the story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews against around two thousand six\nTommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen and it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty\nPounds Monday Tommy was hanging out with a friend when he says hey you want the rest of this pre workout pre workout it's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and that just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um [noise] you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid in case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those\nGot it so you got to Amazon and you put in iPhone cables [noise] um yes so we had ... over twenty thousand is I'll Try and chaos that's allowed yet we're the anxiety starts so we're going to click on the one that we like\nAll right so this one has a hundred and Seventy seven reviews for stars like that which is great on the surface\nAnd then you take the URL copy it and then you pasted into vehement okay and then I hit my report and events that were part right and it's a show\nComputing computing bleep bleep bleep bleep whatever it's going to take a wild reading like a hundred and Seventy seven reviews would take me like five hours\nAny rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noonan on the line to walk us through a few of the things his website flags about these iPhone cable reviews\nOf him so for this product we see that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average these\nReviews of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average views they weigh more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it\nSo the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the phrases that are used in the reviews that or you know free words or more um and then we\nAfter them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example\nHe uses that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo ... of them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the courts do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews\nAnd end in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and to use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that way [laughter] well seven\nPeople also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect there is the correct for hours [laughter] yeah\nSo Tommy software ran about a dozen different tests than a iPhone cable reviews and his reports it out and adjusted invading a so\nIt went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on reviews ... is one point seven stars after Ken reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy side only trust at six percent of the reviews and that trust way they view say actually these cables that crap\nTommy says generally speaking cables like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm like what yeah yeah I phoned cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills to stop we of\nCourse reached out to Amazon and about this and they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy's website they sent us an extensive statement about it have you met itself admits that they do not have the fifty states you could do this when I was like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even the with high confidence whether a review with fake according to what\nAmazon saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural fire Amazon that as a problem\nWe have hundreds of millions of views on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in it\nAmazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and all of that total less than one percent or an authentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake with yours\nIn other words the Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust the big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSo it's complicated right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review it someone buys a product that's good for the site\nBut that that might come a time where there was just too many fake they'd be sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up yes on the Internet shopping\nAnd we'll go back to find time for him to leave and go back to Iran has primarily my friend [laughter] right [laughter] well there is a point where it's just that all of that and we have to go back to talking to her friends again but you have to call your mom\nShopping advice at yes what you pay your news [noise]\nToday's show was produced by next mountain editor is Bryant or

in fact if you invested the seven thousand dollars in Paris stock in Nineteen Ninety nine\nYou'd be sitting on more than half a million dollars by two thousand Seventeen\nNow the thing is if you met Ron shake say in high school this is not the pad and you'd have predicted foreign Ron wasn't even interested in business his passion was politics his parents were ranging liberals and Ron grew up

to notice about run shake and the story of how he eventually build an Arab red is just how\nMany times along the way he sees new opportunities or best to improvise and adapt again and again and again Ron comes to a point where he has to make a big pivot and transformed his business and in Nineteen eighty five three years after\nIran acquires a small fringe bakery in Boston called along than a business that's really struggling he manages to turn things around with his partner Luke came but it's still a small business in fact Ron himself works at the sales counter during the day [noise]\nLike doing that actually helps them figure out almost by accident his next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five I Would be in a restaurant working [noise] and I have a customer walk up to me going to have a good issue or a new slice it I'd have to ... and they pull out a fair from the local\nSupermarket from local stop and\nAnd what I have that bad guy I said sure and they say slice it I'd hand in the ... and they pull out effect from the local\nSupermarket from a local stop and shop and they put roasted turkey and maybe\nAnd you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA to say wow\nThe real thing here is that the ...\nIs not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the purse French bakery cafe in the Copley Place mall in Boston he decided that you were going to make this a new experience a new open pen experience where people could come and\nEat lunch and buy bread\nYeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right and almost instantly is broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened in Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we opened the doors\nAnd what were you surprised they're\nWe were serving sandwiches\nAnd some soups made on our Britain costs on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on on real French back at it would be a\nRoasted turkey brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing and I don't think we had the language for back then but what the big recap I was [noise] was an altar of between down and dirty fast food yeah and find yeah and for\nPeople who were working in white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings\nThis was the first example of what we later came to cough fashion casual\nThis was an attempt to do something that was better but in a quick service mode [noise]\nSo so once you know surf stones idea of creating\nCafes and bakeries it was up to the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin a pretty rapid expansion\nWell guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a bakery cafe we saw all kinds of interest in that we became hot you know every major office building one French crickets and we found we developed big competitors [noise]\nAll right so something exciting happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is a long panic choirs is a small chain of St Louis based sandwich shops called the same\nEarly in this period as shortly after you go public which is a long ten acquires this a small chain of St Louis based sandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy a dislike small chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn it into a ...\n[noise] no I you know I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from that I was asked by an investment bank to me several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis doing ... homeless as much as we did with old bones pet\nBut doing so in suburban St Louis and it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis for a company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in suburban marketplace while oh bump him was our urban stress\nSo in November Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nYou choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing\nWe rename than concept [noise]\nAn air bread in all markets others in St Louis but we renamed it their bread because as we went to new markets people often thought St Louis was more associated with Clydesdale horses now than it was breath right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight mirror you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where we could you expand beyond those original Nineteen\nYeah by Nineteen Ninety eight we roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I
