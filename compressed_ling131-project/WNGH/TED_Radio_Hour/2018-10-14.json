[noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons big it is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing\n[noise] even live in these recent changes as a status\nIn force in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing [noise]\nEven live in these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals are guys he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation that Peter Singer ... ... you\nKnow I read Peter Singer spoken Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defenseless and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer\nAnd my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals is that your side is trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal per se is\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially\nChanged the designation of non human animals from legal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Stephen ... was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nChange summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from\nOf course at versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia about Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London\nAnd after he got there James decided he was going to escape\nOf the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because when they see a century slave one of the major responsibility Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London signed him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were Jan's was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is Scott and parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law ... corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd he does have these corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and get a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat\nBecause James Somerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a right of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that\nHe would assume without deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person that he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as long as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your game summers of course a non human version of James numbers and [noise]\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find\nJames Summers that of course a non human version of James numbers and [noise]\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far are chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous bangs that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed a hundred and sixty pages of half a day that we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge to allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against every idea of justice and\nOn the show today are hacking the law I'm Guy rise and

Adams saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of stuff's election if it's ... you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years of that kind of income\nI Would of course probably\nWant to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change as one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first uh comedy in the world to instigate a one day like the chamber in one solution chamber once will titian buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians\nBusily back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for about a produces a pass to old is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course some very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these parliaments tried to say to your friend I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nAnd we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling thoughts the surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question is not\nWould be the perfect of course not painful a fellow human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nRealistically is if I can really spread out on a global scale in your lifetime\nWe have out strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government\nYeah and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the average citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to\nA sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddy selected by selfish and that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle is to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try to\nYes ah yeah it ... it I'm not ... I think it will be easy to political changes every easy or especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate on to try something new I think half systems ... noticed a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n[noise]\nOn the show today ideas that hacking of the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is\nThis is ...
