concerned that you are to states symbol even though it had a Confederate emblem well\nFirst I Want to say thank you to the Atlanta press club for having me and I want to say that I'm a very proud Georgia and I graduated from our public high schools I went to Spelman College here in Atlanta I left for graduate school in law school but came back as soon as I could I came back because I wanted to help build my state making a stronger place\nAnd twenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial divisiveness that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol I took an action of peaceful protest I said that that was wrong and ten years later my opponent\nBrian Kemp actually voted to remove that symbol when I'm fighting for now there was more of a door devalue making sure that we expand Medicaid so everyone has access to health insurance ensuring that all of our children get educated at strong schools to understand their needs and making certain that we create\nGood prosperous jobs across the state of Georgia all one hundred and fifty thousand counties that would that's what I Want to do because I'm proud of Georgia and proud to be a Georgian\nThank you moving on great boosting please ask a question of Mr kept\nSecretary ... ... ... dollars have repeatedly called on you to resign as the state's top election official rejected those calls to part question for you one do you believe you can in partially oversee the state's elections while also running for governor and to your office was required by law to direct it recounts when you were to yourself a recount is necessary\nThank you so much for having me this evening appreciate the question I took the oath of office to ... we would amount to continue to do is anyone knows about elections in Georgia\nAnd I appreciate that question I took the oath of office to service sector state and that's exactly what I'm going to continue to do\nIs anyone that knows about elections in George's County elections officials that are actually holding the election which is going on right now and will be on election day their local bipartisan election boards tallies the votes in the election they're certified at the\nLocal level and then hand delivered to our office so I'm doing the exact same thing that Democrat Kathy Cox was doing when she was running for governor you know if we had the instance of a recount no that's automated automatic by state law or lower than one percent that again is something that the county's do\nAnd we've got a very confident elections teamed oversee that process and I'm certain that there would be a lot of people watching that\nAnd I had steak mind tiger did my whole career on the duty that I have is secretary of state I've always ... and follow the laws of our state and I'll continue to do that through the tenure of my service to describe state bank you\nMr Kemp thank you for that opening remarks they're a\nGreat lifting we go back to you to pet met Mr best for your promise to cut spending by slash and when you called obsolete inefficient unnecessary and unconstitutional agencies what typically what'd you unlimited what do you think the Georgians who to who might depend on their services get another job\n\nThat they are here and\nFire alarm here to do\n\nI Try\nTake a break because there is a debate here the better candidate they say they want to see the audience is like she was like\nThe debate\n\nI think his record as one that causes great concern to me and to others I'm running for governor because I have a proven track record of leadership\nI have comprehensive plans for the future of Georgia and I have a record I'm happy to stand on and stand beside we have to have proven leadership and the state of Georgia that will hold self accountable and we'll never have to be taken to court to do its job is to have a rebuttal\n... rooms you sort of have similar management problems with your own check books you know you're turning fifty thousand dollar iris the\nNew Thirteen thousand dollars in business ... unemployment insurance contributions and you're curious as to well making hundreds of thousands of dollars annually and even when you're campaigning fifty thousand dollars if if you can't manage your own finances and pay your own creditors can it'd be trusted to manage the state budget\nGiven that he invoked me in his battle if I may run\nBy very proudly take care of my parents my niece and my grandmother\nI Know that you can do for your taxes but you cannot differ cancer treatment payments for your father I owe taxes to the federal government and I pay those taxes I'm On a payment plan I'm current and I never walked away from my responsibilities\nMore than that every time I found out that there is a challenge I quickly responded I've never had to be sued to do my job and so I Would say that my responses and this is proof that I Am not only a strong leader but I have the right priorities Georgia values that said put family first and take care of all of your obligations I'd never served my responsibilities at I never will\nOr ms Abrams thank you so much of it is your turn to ask a question do you don't mind Ryan kid it's if you don't mind staying here has a flow you name in the original question that I never got to rub rub up too because he also nine lives as a room so\nShe she had a chance to respond directly to we'll give you a twenty seconds Mr Taylor I don't like that is correct for you to do that you are you need to moving Stacey Abrams has still for right now we're giving you twenty seconds to respond okay\nThat's correct for you to do that you are you need it\nMoving to Stacey Abrams hassle for right now we're giving you twenty seconds to respond\nOkay we'll both for all of these things that I said are not true I Would encourage Georgia's to look at the record we have more voters on the role of the one I took office are created\nThe process for overseas military ballots to be delivered electronically ah we have made it easier to vote in hard to cheat and just because Mr Abrams ... faults lawsuit or the New Georgia project it doesn't mean it's right and we defeated that in two thousand and fourteen out of\nTime now and you will have time to responding or closing arguments as well as a friend who have the floor you are to ask a Mr Kemp a question\nCertainly Mr Kemp you has placed fighting drug trafficking gangs\nAnd narrow communities as one of your top priority we know now that more than three thousand local law enforcement are on food stamps due to low paying their communities when asked about taking action as governor he refused to take responsibility saying that it is not a state issue that it should be left to the county and local government\nMy question is is why is it not the governor's responsibility to ensure that law enforcement officers protecting our state are paid a living wage\nWell thank you for that costs and I'm Glad to respond to the state government has responded under governors deal leaders governor deals leadership and I'm proud to have their support in this campaign is increased a state patrol play pay other state law enforcement folks including\nA individuals and the secretary of state's office and that is the duty of the state not of the county government\nUnlike my opponent who has been using the same pot of money to pay everybody everything your taxes will go up Thirteen thousand dollars per person to pay for that that is irresponsible and as governor I wouldn't take part in that in that as well I've got a plan to\nImplement a spending cap so we can continue to low taxes have low taxes no good paying jobs in our state that is what will increase pay at the county level and for local law enforcement\nAbrams would you like to respond once again my opponent Mr camp is being misleading and using cherry picked information local law enforcement does indeed held responsibility it's our county sheriff's that are pulling over these folks in rural counties it's our local police officers who are on food stamps because they don't have access to what they need\nAnd no one in the state is more outraged by drug trafficking than I Am my younger brother fights daily and its\nLocal police officers who are on food stamps because they don't have access to what they need\nAnd no one in the state is more outraged by drug trafficking that I Am my younger brother fights daily an addiction that is fed by these traffickers but I Will never ask law enforcement to do something without standing with them and making sure they can put food on their tables well we asked them to protect our families thank you ... are we not go back to Mr cab\nTo ask Stacey Abrams the question\nWill ... as you know a in a recent video you called them illegals\nTo a vote for you in this election I was actually shocked that had to watch that video twice or it clearly shows that you were asking for undocumented and documented folks to be part of your winning strategy so my question is why are you encouraging people to break the law for you in this election\nMr Kemp you are very aware that I Know the laws of Georgia when it comes to voting and in fact I Am one of the foremost experts in the state and expansion of voting rights and I have never in my life asked for anyone who was not legally eligible to vote to be able to cast a ballot\nBut I'd asked for that you allow those who are legally eligible to vote to allow them to cast their ballots and in fact we took you to court in two thousand and sixteen and a federal judge said that you wouldn't legally canceled\nThirty four thousand registration you use the exact same system the exact about system that is under dispute right now now I realize that in the next response you're going to say that it's a function of my organization because your tendency is to blame everyone else for the mistakes that you make\nMy responsibility as a leader is to see a problem and try to solve it when I saw that we had eight hundred thousand unregistered people of color in the state of Georgia\nI started an organization that has reached into every county and increase those registrations when I saw the people were being unlawfully denied the right to vote I work to make certain that we hold you accountable and as a next governor of Georgia I Will continue to do my job to make certain that every legally eligible vote it gets cast gets counted ... thank\nYou Mr Kemp would you like to respond well thankfully the truth here is very simple Georgian says simply Google that clip watch what she says you'll know that she's talking about this election and talking about the illegals voting for her\nIn this election they filed the lawsuit to do that which she which she mentioned but even the ice enforcement director under the Obama administration said that she should\nDrop out of this race because of encouraging illegals to vote in this election not as outrageous she knows that that is criminal if you watch the videos a yourself you will see it\nThis race because of encouraging illegals to vote in this election that is outrageous she knows that that is criminal if you watch the videos a yourself you will see it first hand would you like to weigh in here out of all fairness\nWell out of all fairness I Would like to say that no Stacey Abrams\nTakes money from donors for the third sector development on the New Georgia project to do function that essentially anyone else to do in the people themselves could go\nOn line to register to vote they could get a ride to go and register to vote but the thing is you know she also uses that influence with other five oh one C. three organizations to actually do phone banking and voter drives really and\nI'm specifically for her campaign and that's a violation of five oh one C. three charters\nExcuse me I have to end your thought there was a friends would you like to respond and unfortunately my opponent Mr ... is very confused about what is at stake\nMy campaign the ... campaign operates as a set print organization I'm no longer responsible for or involved in the New Georgia project I have never failed to meet my responsibility as a tax attorney with the federal tax exempt organization law\nI very carefully followed the law and ensure that we never crossed any lines and we only work for the public good\nI'm running for governor because I recognize that that public that has to happen with public and private partnership and I've worked hard to make certain that the nonprofit sector the public sector and the private sector I worked in next door to door there and we're all you're at a time would you like to end up with a rebuttal Mr cap [noise] well\nI mean I think I've already been voted the question I asked her um but I don't believe living on a tablet\nOr at least ask you a question of where I guess\nAll came Mr Kemp an independent watchdog group has documented overturned serious ethical concerns against representative Abrams and they filed to ethics complaints these includes issues such as using campaign were resources to sell her books\nFor personal profit reimbursing yourself eighty four thousand dollars in campaign funds without disclosing where the money went and an accurate financial disclosures should someone that of of that ethical\nQualification really be elected as governor [laughter] well\nI certainly have serious concerns on the things that you mentioned appreciate that question I Would say was more concerning uh is miss Abrams being a tax attorney is her not paying her taxes while she took the opportunity to lung her campaign fifty thousand dollars um instead of doing that\nThe attorney is her not paying her taxes while she\nTook the opportunity to lung her campaign fifty thousand dollars um instead of doing that I don't think I could get away with that I don't think Mr Mets can get away with that and the people of Georgia couldn't get away with that and when you're putting politics overpaying\nOr the government the taxes you oh I I think that does make you a unfit to be governor nuts why\nOr even in tough times battling the recession and invested in a in a tough business deal where the company owes someone some money my wife and I have always paid our taxes that's what we do is Jordan and that's the kind of governor I'll be staying with integrity and the people of the state\nOr to honor the good money that they're sending us to spend it wisely budget conservatively to cut taxes in the future not raise them like ...\nLet's get less Abrams had a chance to respond to once again ... they're being very misleading\nAnd substance abuse treatment which can only be done through the expansion of Medicaid especially in a rural communities that needed desperately\nThank you so much Greg you've been waiting patiently over here and do you have a loaded question [laughter] it is they're starting to have to question their criminal\nJustice really the question was Abrams the city of Atlanta recently eliminated the cash bond requirement for some offenders as a result of the large increase in the number of people failing to appear in there for the court did call for a similar statewide measure of Atlanta struggles to implement this policy why is it a good idea for the state and\nI've worked for the last eight years with Governor Nathan Deal on criminal justice reform and in fact in twenty Eighteen he signed legislation to help reduce cash bail because we recognize that it criminalize of being poor\nI think using it land as an example is a poor example because at the same time that land and put the program in place their cyber security was hijacked\nWe do not know if it's a challenge that's based on failure to appear because of lack of information because they are not able to work their systems or if it's directly related to the cash bill system but I Will tell you that across the country in states that have imposed the system they have seen a return rate they're equal to those who are on that have access to cash bail they're also saying that\nBut I Will tell you that across the country in states that have imposed a system they've seen returned rates that are equal to those who are on they had access to cash bail they're also saying that poor people are losing their jobs and being forced out of the economy because of crimes that they may or may not have committed\nCriminal justice reform ... cannot stop and twenty Eighteen we must continue to fight for it and I look forward to continuing nascent deals like I say this is one area where we have reduced cost we've increased productivity and we made our streets safer he wants to help reduce crime let's make certain recidivism is a part of the issue\nThank him and say from the focus of a tonight's debate as to tackle the issues and concerns of the people here in Georgia the issue regarding voter suppression\nHas created this astronomical sidebar to this election and we've touched on it earlier tonight but I think we need to delve into it a little more and I have questions for all three of you\nMr cap that our secretary of state since ...\nCan you stand here tonight and say as overseer of our states elections there is no attempt on your part or your campaigns part to suppress the minority vote that would likely benefit a minority candidate who you are in a statistical dead heat according to recent polls\nAbsolutely not and and voters should look at the numbers and know that this was all a distraction to take away from ... rooms extreme agenda that she has for a government takeover of healthcare wanting to get a scholarship to those that are here\nIllegally in many many other radicalization timing to raise taxes for Thirteen thousand dollars per person in our state to pay for all of this if you look at the numbers minority participation\nIn Georgia is a twenty three percent we have a million more people on our voter rolls today than we had when I took office we've had record turnouts in our last presidential election and we're having record turnouts right now\nIn this farce about voter suppression and\nPeople being held up from being on the rolls and being able to vote is absolutely not true\nAnyone who is meet the requirements that it's on the pending list all they have to do is do the same thing that you are not home I have to do go to your polling location show your government id and you can vote was Seventy five percent of those individuals missed the\nSocialist Saturday to Toronto you are at an all time the savings would you like to risk thought\nI Would indeed the right to say right I grew up in a family that fought for the right to vote before they\nSo you are at an all time the savings would you like\nTo risk thought I Would indeed the right to the same rights I grew up in a family that fought for the right to vote before they were old enough to do so my father was arrested helping people register and so I take the right to that very seriously\nI only believe that those who have the legal eligibility to vote should cast a ballot but I also understand that under ... under secretary camp\nMore people have lost the right to vote in the state of Georgia they've been purged they've been suppressed and they've been scared\nThis is a man who had someone arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot he raided the offices\nOf organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of voters oppression feed the narrative because that is the president isn't only about blocking the vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count as an ex governor of Georgia I Will work with the secretary of state to ensure that there is no question that the right to vote in Georgia is not a privilege\nIs indeed a right that belongs to those who are Georgia citizens and I will work hard to make it so\nMuch for camp would you like to do is just factually not true\nSeventy five percent of the people after you take out people that were pending like my Seventeen and a half year old daughter was pinned the only pending list when she turned Eighteen she came off when you take off people that had registered that had a potential double nine or when you count people like Jesus\nFrom heaven street that are on these list there on the pending lists no one's keeping them from voting\nSeventy five percent of the people are being held because of something that was pre cleared blew the Obama Justice department because their Social Security number didn't match it later used to own line system\nThat miss Abrams voted against they would not be having this issue she's blaming me for a problem this her grown to create\nThe savings will give you a chance to respond if we do want to get Mr Mets involved here you can expand on the initial question or I have a a particular question for you you represent the Libertarian Party your polling far behind a year or two front runners here\nDoes the issue of possible voter suppression striking a nerve with you and when you go as far as justify the concerns of a lot of people out there that this race is being rigged\nI feel as if it's a much ado about nothing the real issue here is if you look at the voter turnout for past elections\nLess than sixty percent of the voters ever actually turn out the ... most recent Pew nationwide survey showed that forty percent of people identified\nSixty percent of the voters ever actually turn out\nThe ... most recent Pew nationwide survey showed that forty percent of people identified as independence\nLess than thirty percent of people identified as Republicans in less than thirty percent\nOf identified as Democrats the problem is that we don't have a third voice in government for independence to actually listen to and to vote for so the whole thing about voter suppression those are not you know they're they're trying to\nPull apart and vote for one of the two teams there are more people that are more interested in her hearing your third voice been voting for\nThe murder team blue so again I don't think there's those large urban issues as being blown up to be\nLastly I promise to questions for all of you miss Abrams this one is for you and you can expand on that while you're answering this but the pending applicants that fifty three thousand still have an opportunity to develop by law once their information as clear\nDo you trust that process and if not how we think immediate intervention since your campaign stands to lose the low\nI Begin by saying this I Believe anyone who has submitted an eligible registration form should try to vote if you're on the pending list absolutely go and cast a ballot\nBut the reality is voter suppression is not simply about being told no it's about being told it's going to be hard to cast a ballot and that's the deeper concern that I have because under his eight years of leadership Mr Kemp has created an atmosphere of fear around the right to that in the state of Georgia\nI've worked hard as a leader in the state I did not vote against online registration I voted against hiding our judicial elections in primaries which is what Republicans were doing\nTo reduce turned out I have voted for absolutely protecting the right to vote and expanding that right to that I did it not only as a legislator I did it as a private citizen\nWho raised money to make certain that the least\nLikely voters would have an opportunity to have their voices heard\nAnd I stand by that work in a federal judge held Mr Kemp accountable for the exact match system in two thousand and sixteen that is the same system we're just debating today whether it's fifty three thousand or five thousand a sad or five Abrams I saw in five ... are being denied the right to vote are afraid of the right to the\nThe moderate on the ... party and says the public trust their chance thirty seconds\nNo one's been denied the right in the book it's never been easier to register in our state is ... rooms folks that she's registering with paper applications who used to own lines system and we're using their state issued\nIn our state is miss Abrams folks that she's registering with paper applications had used to own lines system and we're using their state issued id or their uh\nGeorgia id they would not be having these problems the reason they're having these problems is because her canvassers didn't fill the form out correctly they couldn't get the last four digits of the Social Security right\nIssue was pre cleared by the Obama Justice department if you want to blame somebody bright buying ... President Obama\nWe're following the law in Georgia this has been going on for fifty years and that is why we have a record number of people on the rules are seven million people that have correctly filled the form out and sees blaming me for ... that didn't couldn't do that or\nThey they simply don't exist fourteen percent of these people are held over\nFrom two thousand and fourteen when she accused me of doing something we went to court and we won on all ten camped\nOut of fairness or the panelists they have questions as well we're glad you asked me he did or second politically\nFirst and foremost and twenty fourteen with the judge said was not that he acquitted\nMr Ken what he said is that there was no legal basis because he had no obligation to actually do his job in a timely fashion as because in the state of Georgia you are not required\nTo finally pastas applications and it's a very misleading to suggest otherwise but the larger issue is that online voter registration works in communities that have broadband going back to Mr mulloy question one of the things I Would do is expand access rural broadband because you can't do online voting in communities where you can't get access to a cell phone or to look into cuter\nThank you very much will ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "23"}
