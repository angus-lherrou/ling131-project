um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating from law school\nAnd what was what was the idea behind it you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise] that's right\nAnd I like lots of people had no idea what was going on number legal system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense clinic at NYU and step into Manhattan criminal court and never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg\nWhat I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes for justice [noise]\nAnd I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is\nWe defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts is deeply deeply defined by climbing by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities [noise]\nHere's more from Robin divergent on the ...\nRate um themselves\nFundamental to the American vacation editors enshrined in our constitution and yet in America

Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like eight years even wise\nLike that you look at the pencil [noise] it's a it's a legal thing [noise]\nIt's so rare books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] they rate age that you'll stay behind me they too are legal things\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book out almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person\nWell since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nBut a person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman or persons\nBut slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be ... [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons but it is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain\nHow that works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing\n[noise] even live in these recent changes as staff or broadening the definition of legal person to include animals [noise]\nOr even live in these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person to include animals or cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer ... ... [noise]\nNow my red Peter Singer spoken Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defenseless and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer\nAnd my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals is that your side is trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal per se is\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially ...\nChanged the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first lawsuits\nAnd that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Stephen ... was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nChange summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa have survived the middle passage and he was sold\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia about Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape\nOf the first things he did was to get himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because when Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibilities Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one change Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London signed him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were Jan's was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is Scott and parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law ... corpus on behalf of James Somerset and I have to pay this corpus it's meant to protect\nAny of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for I read the papers corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that's a common law would not support in the order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal\nTrans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find who James ... we began with those non human animals who\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find her James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far are chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on we filed a hundred and sixty pages of half a day that we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge to allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against every idea of justice

about hacking the law and we were just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out\nTen thousand lettuce to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that my uh increase you would then\nFor those who wish to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some pilot population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John out of some people\nI'm not I'm Sorry I'm Talking to scratch the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams ducked with settlers [laughter] yeah this is famous got diagnosed Adams saying are the people who want political power I specifically the people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if its\nWe want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power um by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also propose that if you pay these people to all three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income\nI Would of course probably\nWant to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change his one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to\nInstigate a one like the chamber in one solution chamber once once you shouldn't buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians\nBusy back stabbing each other and engaging in a typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a produces a path to old is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course some very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these parliaments tried to say to your friends I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nAnd we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling thoughts the surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act\nResponsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question is not\nWould be the perfect of costs not painful fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nRealistically if you can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have our strategy and that is yet to to get the ... assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds\nTo a sponsor\nWhich seems to be happening now after the average citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to\nA sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddies slipped to ... that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle to try to convince\nPeople and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah I'm not going to be easy out into political changes every easy\nOr especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate on to try something new I think half system's broken hadn't noticed a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy can find his full
