responsible drinking and from the any each case the foundation\n\nIt's the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and I'll show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking to a biochemist Sam stern bird who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine\nCould make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like super heroes write a perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right those are the other I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nSuperhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I that I think that's that's the science fiction association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or\nLeader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that\nCould in theory [noise] allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that technologies are promising like if there was a in a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely\nBecause we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside so what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child\nEven though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity we might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just selected traits still inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention\nSee they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nBest disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wanders\nSweeping during that you know you know what I mean like raise the price that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and make that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years that we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this\nVery radio issue of directing future evolution [noise] you know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it in embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] ... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the I think of all power to control an illusion [noise] you can check out his attack at ... dot com [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nToday show or asking a very important question is who are we\n... do you have the answer dino who we are a ...\nWe're asking a very important question which is [noise] who are we\nDo have the answer do you know who we are\nA number I Am [laughter] but\nAh every year I ever had a an area where we are\nAs Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nSo what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell ... there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection better equipped us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just said and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with us okay I'll do my best\n[noise] [noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from the historian who they are ... you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist actually Mountain View the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J go without\nWhy should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people have found congenial foremost is that if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut or something is written on the slate and some people could have more of a others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nBut if something is written on the slate and some people could have more\nOthers and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political sphere of human nature is that\nIf we were blind way we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect the of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instinct and perhaps some of them can damage to selflessness prejudice and violence [laughter] first of all there\nOf reasons to go for the human mind here's a blank slate just come from a common saying as many people have told me over the years anyone who's had\nThan one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and power doesn't all come from the outside and anyone who\nI'm Guy rise and you're listening to the Ted radio hour from NPR\nOn the next step laying on\nMy told Michelle I was turning forty age you're claiming
