New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and I didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable\nWith me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I Move on and a strong funny ... way people are able to move on\nWith me because I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think so\nBecause I mean disability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television this really has made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being monster bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pain don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my father's ... you can do it yes you can can [noise]\nIf my three older sisters we're mopping I was not but if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went through the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aid we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he used this he wouldn't dangle adults\nYeah I mean I Walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking I Know they tactic that he uses his he wouldn't dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me have my inner stripper was very strong and\n[laughter]\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a chance to weigh in on one too many times [noise] [noise]\nSo when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\n\nWhen did you realize that you were funny [noise] [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York\nCity started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior you know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were\nNot typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his daring [laughter]\nYou know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their ... their challenges to humor right [laughter]\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or for Arabs and and and\nYou see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven\nIn New York City my friend and I found that the New York are marking comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happen to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just wanted to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nOh about guys are talking about several probably talked about you know like I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having\nCutting it as contentious mid term election there's increased attention on Georgia's voting system pending voter registrations absentee\nBallot requests

life\nThere were just hearing from comedian again for ... and she had a group of Muslim comedians\nTraveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patience [laughter]\nYeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more bees without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nThat trip and again took was the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called\nThe Muslims are coming in too long after it came up something happened back in New York a place where the game usually felt welcomed and accepted\nGroup spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be bigoted you might as well use a better find but\nDid

approved and we're supposed to go up\nA the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content was about a couple of those posters here one of the Muslim Muslims\nOr what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe\nFor us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters cat fighting bigotry with a delightful\nLawsuit campaign\nBasically what I'm saying as a couple of dirt comedians took on a major in New York City agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWeird feeling I was like no longer feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that I continue telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changed all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\nWhen you talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of the film I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was\nPretty successful yeah so I mean you know one of our stopped with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called name that religion we're going to read a

touched me\nTo do we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stopping them so why would we hold Islam to separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh\nYou know a lot of difference of three of them do\n[noise]\nThat I mean that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nThe American people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim\nDoing very publicly Muslim thing little performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found [noise] the way I like to look at it as you get one person to live in a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and does chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shift in perception\nIs social change [noise] but it takes time and it takes like millions of these\nChuckle [noise]\nComedian again first she's the author of how to make white people laugh

for you know [noise]\nSo I'm usually being funny is like Kevin does for a living but being funny\nIs also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation\nOr a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\n\nBut I also think that humor can be the invitation into ideas thoughts and stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable in heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time and in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Chatsworth", "day": "30"}
