the audience was like\nKind of uncomfortable right because you you were talking about how you shake like she cure and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire you know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially\nWhen I Do naturally because I've been stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was doing New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and I didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable\nWith me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of all the way people are able to move on with me\nBecause I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you\nThink so because I mean this really has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television this really has made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been ... because like\nEven someone

walking like a chance to I'd been sworn into any time [noise]\n\nTo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk at five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\n\nWhen did you realize that you were funny [noise] [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning\nRealize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior you know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were\nNot typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an author and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his\n[laughter] you know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their dean is right or or their challenges their humor right and do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy\nComedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons writer or their challenges humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy in the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and

comedians\nTraveled around the country doing what they call social justice county and they were trying to open up a conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patience [laughter]\nYeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes but when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah\nAnd what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip and again took was the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after it came out something happened back in New York a place where again usually felt welcomed than accepted\nGroup spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the NCAA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly

the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign\nBasically what I'm saying is a couple of dirt comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWeird feeling I was like as a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nWork is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that I continue telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nChanged all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\nReally took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nSo I mean

was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh\nYou know a lot of ... three of them do\nThat means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nThe American people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get love in return

humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas and thoughts and stories that\nMight otherwise be too uncomfortable in heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time
