freedom and justice\nCNN blog\nI'm always supported Amnesty International but they picked the wrong case to showcase their opposition to capital punishment which I share\nThey had that much of the facts no physical evidence from seven nine recorded both claim phone\nWas encountered of all the gene Woodford retired warden\nWe write to us former wardens who have had direct involvement in executions\nSome of us have executed prisoners who maintain their innocence until the end it is those cases that are most haunting to an executioner we write to you with the overwhelming concern that in innocent person could be executed and night and the case of Troy Anthony Davis\nAbout his guilt remains we urge you to ask the Georgia board of pardons and Paroles do we consider that decision said that fail we are Jews and burning staff\nFrom the pain of participating in such a questionable execution\nFrom the website for regular dot coms what really bothers me is the utter and complete lack of acknowledgement of the genuine possibility that Troy really did kill a police officer in cold blood and there's a lot about it ever since\nA sociopath will never ever admit the truth of his crimes you all seem to be forget it is that there is only one party to this affair that can truly be said to be innocent beyond any doubt and that is the murdered officer and his family who are still suffering with every person you cast upon the years of hearings\nInnocent beyond any doubt and that is the murdered officer and his family who are still suffering\nWith every Persian you cast upon the years of

that he's an African American man\nAccused of killing a white police officer and savannah and he's maintained his innocence for Twenty years yes I Know it's really terrible I just he was convicted on eyewitness testimony\nOut of nine witnesses who identified Troy as the shooter have recanted their\nDNA linking him to the crime they never even found a weapon so no physical evidence no DNA and the eye witnesses have recanted I Know I read about this case I Believe he's innocent it's just I Witness testimony is unreliable the police were in a hurry and they chose the wrong man\nNow he's about to be executed for crime he didn't\nWell you've signed the petition it only takes a second\n[noise]\nMm Spencer Lawson district attorney ends up purpose of the law did was for the call to impaneled affair an impartial jury to trial the issues between the state of Georgia and Troy Anthony Davis the whole process that we have in this country is to have a fair and impartial jury to try the issues before the court\nThat is the purpose of having the jury selection and we are not try to pry that much into your personal life it's just that we have a short period of time and what we can find the

him [noise] and you know you also indicated on the questionnaire that you heard those express opinions about the case what was that opinion\nCNN and the New York times and you remember Samantha at

for very long time I know it all started over Twenty years ago I'm aware multiple hearing every time the Troy Davis guilty why do you think that is\nBecause the legal system is racist try doing\nFine you want to get technical the first case in Nineteen Ninety One found him guilty the burden of proof required to prove yourself innocent after a guilty verdict is extraordinary that burden of proof is a weak spot and the law is that what they told you\nYeah but they're not the only ones saying gee su law review the AJC people are really talking about it ironically that burden of proof was put into law by Bill Clinton to try to expedite terrorism trials which disturbs me because I Know I loved Clinton the burden of proof is ridiculously unfair\n\nLosers in the middle of the jury we will continue a raw deal from yesterday the first question is is any culture and it's just the food is the capital punishment [noise]\nSo you indicated on the questionnaire that you knew something about this case yes and did you view people did you talk to other people about the case of ... so the first\nAre you indicated on the questionnaire that you knew something about this case yes and did you hear people

I went to law school yeah you understand and my partner in the for my understand that and you understand the amnesty is not a law firm during advocacy organization I'm sure that they have lawyers that work with them I'm sure that you're right\nThat they're being armchair lawyers and so are you this very dangerous [noise] you're passing judgment about him and citizens based on a few soundbites without having any law background a real knowledge about the\nCase I Know that seven out of nine witnesses recanted or did you read that in the trial transcripts no I read it and the New York times and and the packet amnesty gave me we live in the\nAge of the soundbite Allison people are on the edge of their seats every day just waiting to be outraged about something\nAnd something like this comes up and they are outraged to what I understand that I have to tell you that there's a reason to legal system exist there's a need to protect the accused from the outrage of the moms there has to be room there has to be law and I happen\nTo be one of the people that are charged with keeping the law\nBut I'm Glad that you've ventured out of the house but I don't think you should get involved
