just before the break we were hearing from architect ... ... says design could be part of the solution but it's largely depends on how we use technology\nTechnology was a big part of the problem in the twentieth century when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention\n... and we recreated our landscape around in the twenty first century [noise] technology can be part of the solution is it bends\nTo the needs of the world [noise] and so what do I mean by that take the economist vehicle I don't think the economists vehicle is exciting because it's a driverless car I think what's exciting about the autonomous vehicle is the promise that we have these small urban vehicles that could safely coal mingle\nWith ... and bicycle\nThat would enable us to design two main streets the gang streets without curves maybe streets like wouldn't walkway is on fire island\n[noise] or maybe we can design streets with the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melting snow helps you with your fitness when you walk [noise]\nRemember those big ladder fire trucks what if we could replace them and all the asphalt that comes with them when drones and robots that can rescue people from burning buildings and if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity\nBut now it like you to really manage and with me\nImagine if we could design the hover craft wheelchair [noise]\nInvention that would not only allow equal access [noise]\nWhat would enable us to build the Italian hill town\n[noise] right [noise] an invention that would not only allow\nEqual access [noise]\nWhat would enable us to build the Italian hill town of\nThe twenty first century [noise] I think you'd be amazed to know that it's just a few of these adventures responsive\nTo human need would completely transformed the way we could build our city [noise]\nThing is right let's say we to transform cities into into the more humane places like with the help of technology or whatever [noise] I mean there will still be [noise] some level of inhumanity in them right in the right not is it possible to have no social scored at all\nYou know part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technologists and the room and technology can be wonderful people but they can also be a bit a historical and what I was hoping to convey to a room full of technologists is we need them to invent stuff\nThat helps us bill more humane cities right firefighting drones and the and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and so forth so we can look at all those codes and standards so we have to build with\nAnd change them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first twenty second century because technology is allowed us to change those standards [noise] um\nBut that's not the goal the goal is those standards are changing so we can design this infrastructure so we create some more social friction\nCities at their best our engines of social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring and you saw what was happening interior square we saw what it was happening in Tunisia is because cities tend to be the platform\nFor social change in nation [noise] and social friction requires a kind of lay in my book I call it an infrastructure of opportunity this idea that you're building public\nSpaces subway system [noise]\nThe farmers market or places where people who are from different\nWalks of life meat eyeball to eyeball as social

I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff and I said listen I saw a gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different\n[noise] why don't we make government less complicated rather than more complicated why don't we take this man at his word and I grew up in ... in Nebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people putting my grandparents and my parents work hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning\nAnd accomplish something that's been in green to me since I was a child\nAnd so we just wanted to take that in present an opportunity\nTo worry about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up through the dignity of work\nHere's more from Richard bury on the stage\nBecause there is a better way because\nI Believe there's a better way to get the money then panhandling on the corner I Believe there's a better way to help your

wired to be kind and compassionate it always feels good to have a couple of dollars to someone that is neat but if you talk to panhandlers and many of them will tell you\nThey are a few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body that go towards feeding addiction\nIs Albuquerque the beautiful place or a mile high the Sandia Mountains on the east the Rio Grande runs through the center of

is there anything left to do in your city they know the answer is no would you please give me or mayors phone number because I Need some advice [noise]\nBut the second question you have to ask is this are you supposed to panhandling working if you're taking a punitive approach ominous ingest there solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting\nTo the root of the problem in your city so if you have something to do ... ... people that need something to do\nIt again it is is not that complicated and [noise]\nThe silk so would you do we took an old van from our motor pool a old dodge van
