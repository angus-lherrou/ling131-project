E. S. A. is covering this tragedy and she is with us now Kathleen thank you so much for talking to us what do we know about the identity of the victims so far we do know the police officers were among the wounded\nSure so as victims of the ones who have unfortunately died I have not been identified so far there is a press conference tomorrow morning at nine at eastern time where a an official from the coroner's office is expected to speak so we're expecting that there will be a little bit more information about um\nThat the victim here uh but as you said a six people and have a or were injured in in the shooting four of them police officers and ah they were all taken to hospitals and two of them are are said to be in critical condition but the other for a seem to be doing OK\nAnd can you tell us any more about the alleged gunman Robert Bauer as I understand he was taken into custody alive\nYeah so I'm not a whole lot is being said about vow or it's a official did say today that they are investigating this crime as a hate crime and so it falls under the jurisdiction of the FBI and besides that we don't know a whole lot about him\nCan you tell us any more about what type of weapon or weapons were used and how long it took to subdue him\nShirt so at the scene there were three handguns and one assault rifle recovered a officials said they they weren't sure if all of those were used in the shooting but they they were recovered at the scene and the whole uh the whole situation seem to have lasted about twenty minutes\nOr hours entered the synagogue and uh that is where uh\nThe the shooting happened and then a officials say he walked out of the synagogue and was engaged by a police officer and uh there was a bit of a a ... a shooting exchange there and then ... hours went back

NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling\nAnd talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of the blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night now though Democrats are banking on a ...\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nTalking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them and they're on what's on their minds this election year had help us understand what we've been hearing we ask WHYY states Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered us pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and allies say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state me and for the last six years Pennsylvania's have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shaved and generally acknowledge to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year and a lawsuit that was aimed not in federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state's Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map a a an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion as controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big theme is playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist or do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can say that naming off\nWho will spend and recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the reasons that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country and a lot of that has to do\nWith the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but was also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott ... who's never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary you're not just the policies that are being twisted around and then turned toward the one percent of them the corporations\nAnd away from the Ninety nine percent but just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids uh to raise a kid in this atmosphere this influence coming from the White House\nIs destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America and destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assault on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI or intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and ...\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety twenty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nOn a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue that ties all of us together as money in politics\nMy opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money on this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and I think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending\nWhen you want gun control the amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests stops every single thing that the people want\nYou know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district done uh expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that tells the candidate votes\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voice is going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in your campaign\nIs he's huge I mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just hate the tone still he's\nNot on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming and largely through his own urging he goes around the country singer vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election and of course interest is much higher and presidential elections and\nThe reality is this is the first chance the voters in this district on everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing and the last thing I think anybody wants to see is Trump doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things have got lost just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that well\nScott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help such Patrick does he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative asked most of it\nAnd what about the Trump factor we talked about that as it is that the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talked to butters and ask them what are they thinking about I might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump or the feeling that that Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose\nDreaming on W.

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the\nFBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas who's here with us now to tell us more hello Ryan ... first of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point\nUh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today or here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd or the next several days and weeks we will look at everything and the suspects life is home his vehicle your social media and his movements over the last several days\nUh Jones says officers were covered in assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are gonna searches home they say that they'll take precautions that case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point or the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but that of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has call this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off us attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges or in this case he says that there's no place for hatred of violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\nAnd could you tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight and in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular ...\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nTells me that is likely wouldn't change that much because this sort of crime with eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been used and in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting in prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him a and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just as briefly as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there uh there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts for reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiments\nA and the alleged shooter in this case was of course eleven in custody so possibly uh looking to question him\nThat if NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to us thank you\nAnd once again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this in a week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race\nAnd pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility\nThey told us they hope for more unity and that is the message that might have special residents in Gettysburg the site of an epic civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three wonder if this country's bloody is within fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days\nBut now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there have been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics fact and civility Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy my are also a Democrat joined a group through her friendship with Tom sent and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty sixteen in previous years before that was very politically involved I was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally during the twenty sixth in campaign a saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways and\nUh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the aisle\nSounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had it interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who have been calling for something like this is John Case in Ohio or maybe Joe Biden you could you know the same argument ... former governor of Pennsylvania for sixty of homeland security\nBut you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car came up with a structure for that Darcy what about you is this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now now I really I um I\nFried was slow free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOr I've pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive I never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved\nI think that realizing that that there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find is has just been a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish\nI was hoping that we could come to understand each other more\nAnd I I'm very convinced as Darcy just said\nThat there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue voter but I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of
