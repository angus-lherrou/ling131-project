normal for us to start in the segment by talking about USA Gymnastics but these are not normal times we're going to take this week's developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday as Steve Penny the organization's former presidents did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common that we start to segment we both argument using and for all the wrong reasons this\nGuy's on both the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy rant on sports organization right and he's gotten the lamb and they have to track them down to ...\nBurger and that that bring him back ... taxes\nA grand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing documentary about you\nAs does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either at this guy's trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against USA Gymnastics or to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[noise] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was an which I never thought I Would do it again [laughter]\nRight right well she was announced last friday as USA Gymnastics new interim president\nBy Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first stop\nDoes the fact that ... bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right and that question [laughter] the second issue to me is a bit more complicated\nIn September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker to blackout this swoosh on her Gulf shoes\nAnd as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame\nI might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the memo in which Mary Bono became qualified to run usa [laughter] that's true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you have alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what's the USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states in God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help itself\n[noise] Charlie you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised\nNo because we're smart Karen and the more people to listen to it [laughter] no I mean the basic problem the NFL had with the whole anthrax thing was they had three or four owners who were off the reservation out of Jerry Jones\nBombing mayor down in Houston a church singing and kill and those guys have been pretty much marginalized if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches and was cooler heads prevail\nOr they realize that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer

E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt CMU dot edu slash I I I\nBut but football I can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been to suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football and said that they don't really need to\nTell 'em in there with that yeah and I'm totally ... yeah yeah yeah and\nYou know Tom Brady and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football flag football like with with the with the community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for a risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution pay to\nThe that the G League is a now offer an alternative to the issues one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WMBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the G League it's going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness are but a sign with an agent\nAnd but there is a risk to this one being you're planning and ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself\nFrom the steel perspective as you say in college when you're playing against God's your own age also the G League is not provide the platform that ... billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players by just allowing them to have the ability of the hiring agent to sell their lightness and assign shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the end of all ages\nSort of one day waking up and just dying like oh we're going to do the right thing\nCool fat said probably the best possible outcome from this right or at least as I see it would be that the threat of\nElite high school players going to the G League instead of being one and done would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it I mean I think the only way it works and miss seems like a an uphill battle is is\nThe alternative is a good enough one that can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there is an alternative that's been able to do that\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think I could work but Michael you promised that we could talk about the WNBA issue so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these have high schoolers wed I didn't immediately make that connection like hey this is\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nIngrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players you know what I Do you know the bird has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players and leave that hasn't even like they don't they're not even on but not on the Indian\nAnd and the fact that they would\nMaybe Maureen has a better TV do is really\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one a minute [laughter]\nI totally agree I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite\nBasketball player like male or female like I Love seeing her play and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we we reward mill um athletes much more significant than we do females\nWell we I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WNBA is significantly lower wanting to twenty five percent right and ... percent so as it is only a game tradition we save our most important topic for last nor do you\nYeah I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am just say is from a column for the spotlight investigative team I wrote a piece recently about\nTouchdown and big play celebrations and it was kind of a something that the NFL's than letting players do a little bit more\nI Love when guys get really creative about it I went around and and did a little digging in the patriots locker room and pulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system ah her how to look at a celebration and decide if it's up to snuff\nAnd I have a confession for you guys because\nWhat all the patriots players said was that you just can't celebrate when you're losing and this that actually have a cold it's got an interception a couple of weeks ago in a game and they were down by two scores and they started celebrating\nDuring this dad there you know plus the ads on cameras got them and obviously on TV you see the score\n[noise] more than a week after what are the
