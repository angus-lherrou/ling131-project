Sports has also said that they're monitoring the situation very closely Jessica this is the area that you trafficking when you saw Addison Russell get forty games were major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving and so you know I always described us as like\nA giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult but you know for someone like me who studies college football and sexual violence in particular it wasn't much but urban Meyer he got a little bit of punishment but it it's going to take a long time and a lot of work to get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so in the last few weeks one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammates or greed was originally signed by the Carolina Panthers read isn't all pro level almost all world levels safety at this point and was one of the main people who kneeled next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of massage knee and also sexism and also racism and also everything bad in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David Pepper has said that he sides of the protests that being said\nIt doesn't feel as if the Panthers have done anything monumental by hiring a dissenter hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL\nThey've done nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the cap on the air are finding their way back into the league for us then\nYeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you is that what we do here just to get my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism\nIn met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric read that collusion lawsuit that he's got currently against the NFL now goes away\n... does it get a question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player\nI'm going back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought this up um if we want to talk about the impact on me to on sports the fact that Richard since out there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his new thought any and races out of the threat that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do\n[laughter] I don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that read it back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job got one and also having skepticism that it took this long for it to happen in the entire NFC outhouse needed\nSo they never happened in the first place why why are we waiting until October for this\nExactly every was not on a preseason roster every was on a training camp roster it took multiple mental fall and the gridiron for ... to even get proposed that he should have a job or the general manager Marty hardly ... strictly a football decision and that's when they start to feel duplicitous but we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I always want to point out that it has presser which by the way it's a yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be using classrooms and he's been very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nEric and I talked about this at links that are in their twenties Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to happen\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nViolent I always want to point out that it has presser which by the way the yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be using classrooms and he's been very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nA Eric and I talked about this at a lengthy during the twenty Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to have to go head first on\nShaping your message on what this is all about stay on target if you don't stay on target them they're going to shape it for you and you're going to lose so what he did to me was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filtered through the following one's white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough the lens players perform a service for the owners and the entertainment fan base they have no other rights or concerns they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful\nBut it'll Thomas the safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract and everyone knows the dangers of football the injury risk the short window of opportunity and the fans called him selfish\nAnd he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being carted off the field he flip the middle finger to his ending sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction wasn't to burnish Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\n[laughter] who got your Jersey money though [laughter] you know if\nThere's some way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about this story with JR Smith they came up recently in the NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and then all of this question about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns and putting that in quotes like who owns\nThe ... and when did they do ... sometimes ... refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah you're talking about them is owners the language of sports is very specific right\nI think the anger that comes at a hearing some some of these issues with the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right you belong to the people who pay your paycheck and that's wrong at the basis of it right\nSo the NBA says dearest with actually we do on your skin mhm he has one of two choices he says the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand do my leg\nOr he says the money is more important to my kids but she did say I'm just going to keep pushing and so I think it's powerful that people like Earl Thomas and St GR Smith are standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is if there's a lady on building a field as we've seen with the Steelers office\n\nOn Saturday and weekend edition twists and turns of the Supreme Court shock and what it means

Thirteen ... weird season on Sunday they started the day with the best record in the national league forty eight hours later after two games at home they're finished\nYeah I mean we went home game though you know I mean you know when it's gonna run exactly right you know they kind of weird team all year though yeah you know they went through these spells of what looked like the chimney yeah unfortunately one of those hit at the wrong time\nMobs of lately they scored one run or fewer forty times this year and still one Ninety five game so I guess they should get a medal for that\nOutside of the red Sox winning a hundred and eight games with that Bolton that sat on the top of his most ... second tier\nIt's incredible the only team to score one runner fewer more times than the cubs was the Orioles and they lost a hundred and fifty in game winning and winning Ninety five with that sort of me and my coffins is doing something there is news this week in a novel move tennis channel will begin showing wait for it tennis\nMore specifically the women's tennis tour which went out on its own and the disastrous venture would be in sports for the last two years women's tennis outside of the grand slams has been virtually invisible meanwhile for the past five years many Los Angeles Dodgers fans haven't been able to watch the games and bear market because some cable networks won't carry sports Mitt LA\nWith the combination of court cutting in contempt you think people are realizing that life goes on or if you're just a die hard sports fan do you just wait forever until these corporations figure it out\nYeah I think both are true but I also think there is another phenomenon going on and that is the phenomenon of finding a way to be a fan without attending games that without necessarily watching on TV [laughter] I mean we all have to be a financial betting\nBut now you can be a fan through fantasy sports you can be a financial memorabilia all kinds of ways to do what you can be a fan through media nostalgia yep what this thing with the women's tennis thing reminds me most stuff\nIs a phenomenally to stash decision that the NHL made years ago to get off ESPN and not just for showing us right when they went to ... but they got a spike TV for the playoffs remember that it was just like if he turns ... before that they went to sports channel\nYou know they were ESPN's only professional league you have to sign an ESPN did them up you know they did a mafia than they did what ESPN does which is a high the moon and then they moved on to sports you know that's what this reminds me also\nNow they made a big mistake and I think the good news is at least if you're a fan of WTO tennis and I am 'cause I watched the women as much as I watch them and I'm happy that they're back it'd be an actually watch them for the season\nAnd you know finally Charlie you know no show would be complete without at least some discussion of the Cleveland Browns but here's a story about a different team a barn Iowa has a lot cooler full of Budweiser not Bud Light but Budweiser that it will open\nWhen the corn ... when its first football game of the season great idea right\nYeah I don't know I I don't know if someone bar and I was doing this but okay they're just making philosophers that cooler is likely going to stay close for at least a week\nBut here's my question what happened to Nebraska football if you are of a certain generation\nDon't my late mother in law was from certain Nebraska her brother and her father and grandfather all played football for
