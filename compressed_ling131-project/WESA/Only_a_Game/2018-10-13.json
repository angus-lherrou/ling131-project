most WNBA stars where men signature shoes what gifts but now it's time for the week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie hold\nYour women you all you want to talk about his shoe\nSeeking a shoot out the Seventy Sixers energy oil and beat has signed a five year deal with Under Armour\nIt'll make in the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote there's a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that because she's look really weird and a size Seventeen\nYes I mean speaking as someone who bought at a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on which I Believe we're using as a car for [laughter]\nThe problem with with the they looked fine on the big men right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey look like art auctions but if anybody can do it it's Joelle NBA who has charisma beyond belief um so I mean you've got to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway he thinks of itself a guard I mean you might think of his own to the Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is\nYeah I mean he said he I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but he says he can do at all which I guess means you can shoot\nWeapons will I mean the couch except for the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers to just add a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked few\nYes what shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm of the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bride big enough\nTo make me care about this bribery trial it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is just silly the players are the ones that are going to get hurt most and the NC double a which was on the ropes and staggering has now found its way back to what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking of the players are the ones that get hurt the New York times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutors say the victim is the university's\nFans might say at us but the New York times suggests that it Brian tags spelling whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia\nWill do something wrong with playing in Australia has a really nice place but it's also not national television you know I think Brian Bull is going to be fine I

Australia has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian Bull in going to be fine I think he's going to do as a friendship and Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high\nBut again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized by these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on the show we learned that the woman who is accusing event it's dark Christiana ... of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document in which we're now although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow or no lawyer is saying that document with acquired in a computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the eight thousand reasons why I didn't go to law school I think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove the thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden\nOtherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr Ronaldo who is capable of buying a lot of forensics\nYou've written a lot and your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is to figure out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I really get confused\nAbout what can we ... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instincts and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just banning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nInstead they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our diversity officers understanding what you did wrong and this time isn't going to be spent in a classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with the black people their insulting\nIt's a good idea you know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson explains put up I like inventive thinking on this sort of thing going on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what with mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe wasn't in\nOrder but it'd be Wyoming by the way in this game Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald he had some sort of injury that they did not want to disclose somebody came out onto the field warmed up wearing a Jersey [laughter]\nYou know throwing the throwing the potato to throw the guy out is or what did he does is a real throwback to the the wild west days of sports and I love it I think it's probably something you can only use wants though [laughter] you\nCan find that's

keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like their new and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nWe never satisfy Erin Hatton the time I go you\nRealize care and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox play a more if I was just it's it may have waited long enough\nOf the children All right so I Want to move us out of New England and talk about chimney butler he had an exciting return to minute it's her whole practice on Wednesday\nButler's looking for a trade and to facilitate a trade he reportedly played brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no but I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me and my finest numerous sure that's what you're going to do and saw the lines\nAnd either they is it not the right way for it to come to think it was the wrong thing to do and we don't know what to do I think\nThat I was honest\nOkay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do\nWhat I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes but has frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids are going to do what you do so it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK\nCharlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when\nThe NBA ventures into WWE or you know I'm not going to let you go to Mars you know we do a little concerned\nAbout ... about my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler new exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like\nMan but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on to rules campus for this melt down with advanced warning was somehow a bit of choreography on team bottlers part\nI don't want to say I said that but I didn't\nCare and also I have seen you walk into the studio saying you bleep and uh I don't know if you are one of the cats dogs\nYou know this is where the NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like

not well in Tuscaloosa because those ... good for nothing Alabama students are getting increasingly ambivalent about attending one sided football games once more\nNick Saban is on a war against his own student body we're talking friendly fire for their paltry attendance at Crimson Tide football games\nHis poor Crimson Tide players look up in the stands in the middle of games and it looks like a Miami Marlins game up there but here is a thought for Alabama\nPlay some exciting football games that begin at reasonable times Nick Saban actually got himself worked up about the student crowd at a football game that began at eleven am Charlotte on a Saturday\nSo they realize that it's legal for a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter]\nAlso Alabama was playing Louisiana Lafayette me no no disrespect to Louisiana Lafayette but you know what the score was at halftime what was the score it was seven hundred and Ninety five thousand dollars [laughter] okay forty nine to
