steel and aluminum\nUs so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrible for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just is it worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America in our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrative cost and

year that it wasn't even ready to has the children nor did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department's internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general its findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel hey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but why isn't new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that the age as held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border\nUntil the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds couldn't find any child in our care for any parent\nHGH asked by the way cared for children after they were separated while da Jess had custody of their parents and at the time just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nInspector general found no evidence that

name\nDidn't even show up to my freelance or nothing to get postponed led to three times but\nBird was ultimately acquitted of firearms related charges in that case but his experience echoes those of clients who sued the Allegheny county public defender's office in Nineteen Ninety six\nThe suit described an environment of severe dysfunction clients often didn't meet their lawyer until just minutes before appearing in court the lawsuits that attorneys were saddled with such overwhelming caseloads and denied so many resources that they often cut an advocate effectively\n... the ACLU was one of the attorneys who brought this suit\nWhat that lawsuit did was to pretty much double the resources of that agency so both financially in terms of budget in terms of staffing should they got a bump in ways that\nMost of the other counties Pennsylvania have not\nBut just how much progress the office has actually made in the last two decades is being debated by the chief public defender and a former attorney in his office named Joe Ozzie Ozzie says before he resigned in June defenders had too many cases\nOffice data show trial attorneys like audio were assigned to an average of about sixty cases at any given time over the last year and a half\nBut as Audi notes and the office confirms that number has risen above eighty at times\nAnd if you have an eighty you're juggling and some people are getting the attention and some people are getting great representation but\nI can say at least for me personally\nI felt that there were deficiencies and my representation and it started to weigh on me\nThat Allegheny county public defender's office typically ran surpluses of more than four hundred thousand dollars each year from twenty Thirteen to twenty sixteen that bothered Audi far more than his caseload\nThe solutions to hire more attorney solution was to hire more investigators we had the ability to do that\nChief public defender Elliot how the doesn't see a problem he says his office has simply become better managed\nIn terms of resources in terms of our ability to effectively represent our clients wherever we need\nHere just across the street from the Allegheny county courthouse is devoting more resources than ever before to its clients [noise]\nHe says the office gets clients out of jail before trial three quarters of the time\nAnd that it's getting record numbers of cases

of the complaints would be that I haven't removed turning I don't know what's going on now but the letters are geared more towards information you know what should I expect next you know can you uh expedite my my court hearing you know can you believe contact the family members things like that\nAudi agrees the office has made strides but he says those improvements aren't sustainable without more attorneys and that current public defenders are being asked to do more for low salaries that aren't keeping pace with inflation\nAnd it creates a situation in which there was high turnover there's\nOften dissatisfaction with the work environment\nTo claim it that's not going to have any bad effect on representation I think it's fanciful\nChief defender how's he acknowledges turnover is a challenge and says recruitment and retention our priorities he says three to five attorney positions are vacant at any given time but how's he says public defenders today have far fewer cases than they used to\nHe says in twenty eleven and attorney could be assigned more than a hundred fifty cases [noise]\nRegardless some say staffing and resources alone can't solve the fundamental issues that came to light in the Nineteen Ninety six lawsuit here is a big ball check of ACLU\nStick to progress that we had hoped for never materialized but at some point the litigation can't do it all it really requires leadership within the office and when you don't get that you don't get the progress of the reforms that are needed\nAnd ... there was another limitation ... now again in county\n... county by county approaches are sixty seven counties in Pennsylvania what we truly need is leadership and the general assembly and the governor's office and we need a state wide six\nHarrisburg haven't made the issue a priority and ball checked out that will change\nIf you think about the\nPublic defenders clients these are not exactly the the wealthy the powerful the movers and shakers in society I'm really

seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years that doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service

the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat cares to me that the state

taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do\nBut the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question

NPR News the sound of a free press\nFeared and will soon as senior vice president of the motor and equipment manufacturers\nAssociation which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us or on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding our breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum\nA so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before the finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be tariffs for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just is worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral looming them that's from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrative cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge

toxins for years this put the public fears to rest then amid news of the cancer cluster and twenty six teen\nWorkers made an alarming discovery high levels of pee fast chemicals and surface waters around the landfill\nSince then traces of these industrial toxins have also turned up in nearby wells\nOfficials are still working to pinpoint where the chemicals come from and they may never be sure what caused the cancer cluster but pee fast chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer so neighbors like Jillian lane are still terrified\nRight and so were drinking the water and wear bathing in it were brush her teeth in it and we have no idea that we're living with this potential\nProblem lanes family spent thousands of dollars on high tech water filters and
