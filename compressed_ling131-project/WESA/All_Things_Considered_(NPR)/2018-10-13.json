women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you embody whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself in that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\n... can you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my as these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places that are lots of conversations about sex ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India\nAnd we said very good cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really\nTry to vet my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white him on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both
