all things considered from NPR News I'm Audie Cornish in Washington\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turnaround here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest land under one roof and it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten\nIt's outstanding see most\nScreaming on WGN it's imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nLike when you hear today a sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed dumps Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last\nPeople to leave it was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs\nBeautiful here yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty see you again\nToday Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing the Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back\nTo school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field grew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um\nI at that point was used to being independent he used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once doesn't that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle that\nSo when you think about the word family that you had at willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position you're in today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them in and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when he retired he retired in\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety twenty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... found a free press\nSo that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift\nAt willow run when he was Eighteen [noise] do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a cheese really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me a cycle hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just living normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain low back\nPain has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\n...
