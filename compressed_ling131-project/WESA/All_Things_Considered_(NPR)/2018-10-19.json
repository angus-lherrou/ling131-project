good to be her\nWalk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate could showcased disappearance and perhaps murder\nKnow it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before we've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nHas and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly\nI think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people\n[noise] I'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work ... she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence\nAgencies you're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happens\nAt the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis\nAre there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think\nIs a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but\nAs it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody in in the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not a that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around that the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution\nThat was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for

reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her Vero if he thinks the Republican Party position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position and that's a vision is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the ... elections which Doug ... on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who the former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt wouldn't be as you approach juicy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a\nLot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for the is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am vouch for Doug juice\nBut under that logic\nIf Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way cheetah\nThey see what's going on they see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to ... vote and they said that we were but we're ready to go over there\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in

know very little tasked by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick rocks\nAnd so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me is the only people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people having Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people open the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energize he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now or ... some of the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up that sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them in prison in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda\nA hospital in Ireland near schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and ... communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to say that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and that all you know when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taking it and if they have I felt a little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly
