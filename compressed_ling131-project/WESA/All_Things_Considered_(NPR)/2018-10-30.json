been taken for granted um I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTwo Michelle nearly is underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it
