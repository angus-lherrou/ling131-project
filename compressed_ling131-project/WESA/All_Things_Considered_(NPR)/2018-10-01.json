S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deals ever negotiate it but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump's celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal from called it a positive step for both the country and the world\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country where the most advanced protections for workers\nEver developed in signing on to the deal Canada agreed to open up this long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream\nTo name a few I Want to be very specific\nCanada is still expected by more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the us views as artificially low prices\nIn exchange for these concessions the U.

energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story is pretty much the same what happened\nWhat happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time creating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments\nWith the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in\nAnd get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they

News station the sound of a free press\nOn how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about\nSo the department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they have the stockpile is overseen in the department of energy [noise]\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election noon shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy in climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside the apartment\nBut they the people the outgoing people\nGenerally had the impression that\nHey there's ... from it especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example or inside the department commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it\nThis is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path of dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an up\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nMake more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path of dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investments in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps nuts to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing\nBecause you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme and his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who have made a career out of those are people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a grain of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that no well\nFirst let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this ... active destruction would come and kind of ease or paying she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her barn is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\n... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure\nOf the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us\nTomorrow on MORNING edition California Governor Jerry Brown\nAssigned top net neutrality regulations into law\nDreaming on W.
