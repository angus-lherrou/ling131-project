heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the rest of the Yankees that's how far back\n... this go okay well yeah\nAnd they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's a historic match up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team somehow they miss each other when they both and in the world series was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back and starkly but also it brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how does this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case the Dodgers got torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games that I went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the scene in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire to get back\nIn when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they wouldn't got many Machado I mean this could have been there all kinds of or eat or he's at shortstop they lock Corey seeker during the season so now they have a ... and then\nReally is there a I don't it's not Clinton ... its Walker bealer so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest and one of the best picture that we've seen in the national ... they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what do they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series and Thirty years you know the red Sox have had that highly Boston is that a lot of reasons to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this she is an argument and one of the best\nRegular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's

children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU had been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first said that the vast majority of these children\nStreaming on W E n J pointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in captivity\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring a child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite fee but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThe ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights

with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty word for word from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with a caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nOr there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism
