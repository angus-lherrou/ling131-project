make an informed decision with all\nThe facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted\nThey did not interview many many many witnesses who were identified both by Dr Ford bunnies Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties I made it there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that [noise]\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it

McDonald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are there people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was eventually responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing actively if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWhat would you say some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologists the defense team put on this\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program at\n... dot edu slash I I I\nOf course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that day started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting your day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologists the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officer said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in fact the practices reported on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues to have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigate it CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say\nThis is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what is reform look like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different handled for them to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so\nWhat's going to happen from here [noise]\nShe's the host of sixteen shots at a pod cast WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van Dyke
