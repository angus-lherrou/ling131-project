been following all of these developments and joins us now have rained hell other\nOK so a lot of moving parts here all day where do things stand now what do we now\nAt this point in time authorities are talking about uh six suspicious packages and total a one was addressed to Clinton at her home in New York another to Obama here in Washington DC the secret service intercepted both of those during routine screening overnight they were identified as time has\nPotential explosive devices are and then this morning a third suspicious package was sent to CNN's office in New York City right or on the border of Central Park\nThat one was addressed to Brennan who of course was Obama's CIA director and a CNN evacuated the building a NYPD take off the streets called in the bomb squad and the package was contained in taking away\nRight okay so those packages you can't describe it the winds grabbing the headlines but there were more packages that we know about tell us about\nThat was well another suspicious package was sent to Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder at his law firm here in Washington the address was wrong a package bounce back to the return address which was for democratic

a senior law enforcement official in New York described the devices pipe bombs I said that they a device to Soros was nearly identical to the one cent to Clinton and Obama are we know the most at this point about the package that was sent to CNN officials say\nIt contained a potential explosive device and a a suspicious white powder that hasn't been identified young law enforcement officials that

the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert made says and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen years\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nThe surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza his battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide what stigmatized and this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a player bootstraps mentality Kathy evil\nHas worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think\nOf mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about that suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nWell she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the two sides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nThe classrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nFortune

help others she says that's what her friends did\nFor her actually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nTo share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps people hope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in\nThinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote\nUpstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband to suicide\nThe idea of of having 'em up here or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think is incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad a competitive bike racer he was a community leader seen as a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or lily leaves dad and uncle and this ... a national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nAre really the bulk and focus of a lot of the

those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for

when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not juniors psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the two sides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth

have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who
