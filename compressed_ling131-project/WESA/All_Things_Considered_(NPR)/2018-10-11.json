to order some gear for the for the new year absolutely we very badly need five new a digital recorders and five microphones okay we're going with a shotgun makes that we usually buy from you know\nThe

use the gear as much as we wanted for weeks or months on and maybe even using it every day every day and then at some point if we feel like it\nWe pay you whatever we feel like paying you based partly
