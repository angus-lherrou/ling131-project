unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that\nThe president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents\nAre and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a standard is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is like your show whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar and cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he said something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have it in this book I Am more than she does and I have no\n... and since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy other people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him a thief without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that well\nYou mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the metro what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nYou really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really

president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as a country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all those hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership or here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media uh\nAnd she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so if there's something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console learning cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he said something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after that synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nThe job [noise] I guess she does\nFree
