out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's

businesses he says even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with at this point\nKenya estimates over half of the state small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise the New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including lived trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd requires feedback from the police about the training\nAnd the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York state you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one day that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is in New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nAnd he went after reading that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protected category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but ... he says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if employers not doing as an employee can report it this is something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are going to read about and people are going to do something about\nUnder the new laws existing employees in New York state must undergo training by October of next year ...

schooling has been free there are about to initiate a modest tuition for the upper grades from that I was building an additional campus a few miles away the work is being done by a team of seven teenagers all of whom are wild boys from the streets\nThere now learning about construction and horticulture the vegetables they're growing and the rich volcanic soil will be sold in town and served in the student run cafe with the proceeds plowed back into the school\nIdeas for six additional campuses across Guatemala or swimming around his head\nWe're we're not just educating kids but also even all the resources to do is to make their business so I'm not afraid of being cold [noise] got paid all this and I don't care I Need to pay the bill\nFor years ago the Guatemalan education ministry recognized last but do host and began accepting it's diplomas the school there's only a dozen years old so there haven't been many graduates ten kids have left but does and moved into the workplace many more are in the pipeline\nIn Guatemala the Maya built pyramids invented a writing system and developed a calendar on Pablo Romero believes the seeds of genius are still here they just need watering\nJohn Burnett NPR News will go to the NGO Guatemala\nTake heart the universe is full of good news starting right here on earth in fact it is there like literally start that is what astrophysicist Adam Frank says and I'm going to let him explain\nDirt and by dirt I mean soil is always around to remind us that the world is one giant interconnected Claude of wonder [noise]\nSee if you can just open your science eyes when you look at a handful of soil suddenly you're going to see not just dirt but a seamless and essential network binding together matter energy and life\nWhat do I mean well like a cake batter soils are a mix of ingredients they're made of crushed up rocks sticky clays and a whole lot of organic stuff decaying leaves bacteria worm poop all mixed together\nLet's start with the organic stuff pick up a handful of dirt from a field or a forest floor and you'll be holding more microbes in your hand then there are stars and the galaxy\nBut those billions of microbes don't just live in the soil they make the soil alive if you could zoom in on your hand full of dirt you'd see it was built from countless tiny clumps of rock and play and like a box full\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nDirt from a field or a forest floor and you'll be holding more microbes in your hand then there are stars and the galaxy\nBut those billions of microbes don't just live in the soil they make the soil alive if you could zoom in on your hand full of dirt you'd see it was built from countless tiny clumps of rock and play\nAnd like a box full of different size balls there are a lot of gas in pathways between those clumps that's where the microbes live and they use those gaps took full advantage turning the soil into both hyper complicated network of subway tunnels and the churning chemical reactor\nIt's this chemistry party in a sponge architecture that makes soil the foundation for all the rest of life around you\nSee those busy microbes metabolizing along in their tunnels or what led soil filter rainwater keeping it clean for us to drink\nAnd see elements in the rocks and clay that helped the microbes move nutrients around to underground roots letting acorns turned into giant oaks and wheat seeds turned to the bread you eat for lunch it's not the microbes alone network these miracles and it's not the minerals and plays by themselves that let acorns become oaks\nSoils are a dynamic pulsing tightly woven fabric with Adams constantly being shuffled from non living forms over to the living and back to the non living again\nThrough soils we can see how our bodies and our lives are also a tightly woven tapestry of living and non living world it's not just us over here in the world over there each of us as part of the cosmic fabric of matter energy and change strands can never be separated\nEach of us is an ongoing expression of this
