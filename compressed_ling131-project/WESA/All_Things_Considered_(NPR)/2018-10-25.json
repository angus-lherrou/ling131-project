Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and insurance partly because\nScreaming on W. E. N. imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on the master's program\nAt the end means dot edu flash I I I\nWill and grace system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nAnd Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president's incidents\n[noise] well I I I Know they call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and our family units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows him to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de the northern Arab countries would have been southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was there that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now through for you it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds as opposed to we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute\nOf course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I've had I\nI Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check I have a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravan they liked the care of as a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the laws so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from there to ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison hand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest German

report out this month from the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change paints a dire picture by twenty forty there's a strong risk of crisis including food shortages wildfires and amassed die off of coral reefs unless greenhouse gas emissions are sharply cut\nThe report is aimed directly at policymakers the world has a little more than a decade\nTo reduce the amount of carbon

summer when a young woman at a campaign event asked him about climate change he called her young and naive and was criticized for being both sexist and dismissive of an important issue the wolf campaign immediately jumped on the gaffe handing out bumper stickers that red young and naive voter\nWagner walked back those comments in August when he acknowledged climate change exists but said he couldn't do much about it\n[noise] which\nAlthough ... campaign has seized on minors climate comments\nThe governor has not taken a prominent role in addressing the issue he has taken steps to curb

targets\nFor fool you the requirements for him if there's more that I can do 'em over who's who just as you can do this\nActually he's already pledged to do more in twenty fourteen well said he'd introduced legislation during his first year in office that would set higher clean energy target for the state but he didn't follow through\nThe existing law known as the alternative energy portfolio standard requires utilities to buy eight percent of their power from clean sources like wind and solar the law was considered cutting edge when it passed in two thousand four but since then many other
