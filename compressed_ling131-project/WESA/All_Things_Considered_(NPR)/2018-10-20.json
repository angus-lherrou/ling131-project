earlier this month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the consulate and that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him an unnamed people inside the consulate\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman they note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day to show you arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body\nPresident Trump said he found the Saudi account of what happened credible he also said the fight and accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and

lawmaker who's trying to address it by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first you want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office today to Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times Mr Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss\nThank you so much for having me no I I have to ask do you think that race with a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother as he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrests for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of sort of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to rabbits someone wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as these latest Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm [noise] it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person has a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nDreaming on W E n J imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nWas connected um to issue the poverty that aren't as connected as she does mental health in certain areas and connected to it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I had been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I had the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result as colleagues as Facebook who thought this is an important story and who I'm saddened by other means houses in story they needed to be told\nThat have been a a cookie sheets the sister she naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being paid by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and I put these to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life than happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course apple ... is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't like\nWhy are you know obviously all

with this idea\nFrankly we're having over episodes version of African Americans and Latinos that it up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement door traffic stop I guess ... is kind of tipping

fire the baby\nRight traditions of citizens and police officers ship which last year is that people are thinking the legislation just focus on citizens will it showed\nThat it doesn't just focus on the video is really kind of stage for additional core Scott tip for both the citizen and also polish ...\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to fight the objectives of a what we want\nPolice officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of course is a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of a sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to text to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nLegislators the purpose of the video is as a primer Europe we need to go back and mix it

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society is role in doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and signed something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now I don't think so much for joining us as going to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nSo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts\nFree with law freedom for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThat this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve\nAnd something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nAll kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose I think tanks in Washington DC to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um the Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at that [noise]\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program has been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges\nAnd to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not fine\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey had been very close mouthed about it I tried them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to say who is paying for it\nYou know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who those donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was uh\nScreaming on W E n J it's appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation pertinent
