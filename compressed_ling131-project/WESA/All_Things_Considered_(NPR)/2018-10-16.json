W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nAmericans most of whom were rural farmers access to goods on an equal basis as whites in faraway cities at reasonable prices was a godsend and that's what the catalog was\nI mean from a practical point of view of what had happened previously was they would show up and they would be asked to go to the back of the line behind the white customers and if you're shopping back catalog nobody knows what color you are\nNobody knows who you are and in the era of Jim Crow there was a constant active differences your block you had to wait until all the white customers were served you had to wait until the white store owner let you buy whatever you want it and he may or may not have let you 'cause it was largely on credit [noise]\nSo the Sears catalog appears people could read it at home that could decide what they wanted to order but there were still challenges right I'm In southern store owners fought back\nOh definitely because if you were an African American and he wanted to shop and some other way you were contesting their power and not just the power of the store owner and the power the landlord but basically the power of white supremacy of Jim Crow itself\nAnd so you had lots of store owners pushing back you know burning catalogs and the street very publicly from Sears catalog and burning Sears catalogs and bond fires in the streets all kinds of incentives to destroy these catalogues [laughter]\nSo what did you do to keep all their customers are able to order their products\nWell he published instructions in the catalog how to simply give the requirements to the postman so you didn't have to go through the story and a lot of places the post office was also the general store so it was pretty complicated to even get your\nOrder submitted to the catalog but they found lots of ways to do this for rural African Americans as well as immigrants people who didn't even speak English they had all kinds of clerks available to take your order and nearly any town\nSo your take away is what that this is a reflection on on buying power on retail as as resistance\nYeah I think it's a story of a deep contradiction between Jim Crow and consumer capitalism that you can see in lots of places particularly in this moment in near around Nineteen hundred but also later in the Nineteen fifties and sixties as African Americans acquire were buying power\nThis is part of the demand for civil rights that African Americans could use buses and restaurants and toilets in\nTheaters and everything else that's part of consumer capitalism that this is one of the essential writes a very conservative right of American Capitalism [noise]\nWho Simon he teaches history at Cornell University's School of industrial and labor relations both time and thanks so much pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\nIt's the W E S a full member Dr you're on Ninety point five W E essays or even a pause we're here for these few days to read some money to keep the news and information service that you have come to trust on the air\nThe phone number for one to six nine seven to nine five five or you can reach us on line to W.
