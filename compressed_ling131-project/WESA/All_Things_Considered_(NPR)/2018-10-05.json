[noise]\nBack in July when Kavanaugh was named as the nominee among people gathered at the White House for the big announcement was John Malcolm Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington\nA think tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees Joe Malcolm joins me now welcome it's a pleasure to be with you\nAnd my writing thinking your pal used with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow but it is now looking you recently likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate just some Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there hey I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the things that the judge and he should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings draws me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she quit she said questions there that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what time it on I had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic ...\nI think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if you did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople weighing and I'm continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice while I forward sure one\nBrett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of

say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remark that and he went on to say that the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf several members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad\nCory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his uh the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to center a ... a for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that she was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who hit when you choose to spiking

Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this

Koran McDonald sixteen times\nIt was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon how this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell back because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with eight second degree murder charge\nThis is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists it's feeling like a moment of celebration we've also heard from representative for police like the policing and they're of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did he say\nWell he described require McDonald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes is blank um he said that the\nThat that was ... raised in life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking at the Baskin video of this and said that so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here have been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there's another trial of laid it to the shootings there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald a present it that night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community field but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial and how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shot six soon made a big difference\nThis case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the climate Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that wasn't going to a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke so\nGuilty today of second
