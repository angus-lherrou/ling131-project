American society right now even for people who very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's a hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been\nExtremely ... paid food Trump supporters as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and then they'll site North Korea is an example of that the tariff war with China on the other side of the coin it's division aids the shouting\nScreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation [noise] the town on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\n... and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYeah I mean that trade weren't terrorists that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we're just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conducted little ... primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though China is not buying their crops the down by about twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then which makes ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem at really soon we got to have another hobby snakes human not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to all cause can out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride but usually ... people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in as strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and it usually comes with people who once calling the shots in a society where they feel that they're being left out left behind\nAnd I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had a woman called polling Hansen she's still around and she ran a particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and Asian tourists to strike but people in tourist dependent electric was voting for her and say yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once and it said was to take ... votes of Thanksgiving sometimes that just happens to\nThe question though I think that we're going to have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance to see how you guys and that's my main that the cycle blue why that's coming might just be more of a trickle\nHow much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region [noise]\nWell it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue and people of color they were very very distressed they\nFelt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and\nSort it has roar us and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view\nComing from a president does somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary [noise] Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nTo stray away of compulsory ... statement that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fine if we die hard but a science take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout and that of course changes the nature of politics\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nSanta rather than having to energize the base all the time\nIf you're ... you're a politician and a strike you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that I'm the pain the major political parties for example\nA you know we have a national health scale which would never be touched by either of the major parties I don't think in my lifetime it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to the pot from that that would be the end of their prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMassively more motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from journalist Saddam has that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides were saying this remarkable energizing I'd be very surprised if we can say ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's allegations of suppression\nThat that has had to resist effect and that there has been a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things would be doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump and the priorities that he has and I basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational dead but they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I wouldn't be around to see the worst effects of climate change but I Will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBruce Walker is an Australian political strategists he's been filming a documentary called a hard road travels and Trump's America we'll speak with them again after the midterms\nAre the way if you're a new U.S citizen are voting for the first time here in America we want to hear from you what does voting mean to you and how does it compare with voting in another country\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as later because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to massage all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when the war began\nIs that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success of policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point an news story came out are a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins and the idea that we're going to be decisive flipper really defending what we ought to do is put drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it before it gets close but\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThan there were even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nSo I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue because the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and then America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those\nAnd it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid out for me what is your take on the on the tone things up by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expand it beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's a ... to the rhetoric now and this gets back to what we talked about earlier and values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror\nAnd we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be what I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says well I Need to be a little more patient I lead to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate\nI expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAnd does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWhen I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm I'm at all when you dizzy reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to but I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other\nGeneral Stanley
