report that Russia has been killing dissidents on foreign soil incidents like that which speak the freedoms that we have stalled on the foreign stage for years I mean we need to change our foreign policy toward these countries what should we do\nTerry that's a great question I Want to thank the audience for joining us tonight that's very important debate but that's a very serious issue\nUnited States should be projecting on moral authority across the planet are these are fundamental freedoms that we come to cherish in our country and we should be advocating around the world and when countries\nTake action and it's like this and we'll let this investigation go forward and see who was responsible for Saudi Arabia there needs to be sanctions there needs to be accountability just as there would need to be with Russia and I've advocated for increased sanctions on Russia because we see them doing things that they shouldn't be doing\nA um they have been an aggressor or the ... you look at what they've done in the Ukraine what they've done going back eight ten years ago even in Georgia\nOr to hold these countries accountable or we need to use our moral authority to do that\nMr let me have sixty seconds\nI agree about the importance of moral authority I also agree that we need to let the investigation this particular case because there is on shore classified intelligence they have enormous being in our intelligence agencies to get to the bottom of this sort of we know what really happy\nWhen it comes to moral authority do we do need to be concerned about when the president stood with Vladimir food and you think he'd ah many people felt like he did not help them in that situation so I Hope that's experienced he'll learn from enough of heat\nI'm also very concerned about the ability of our state department to respond in these situations we have seen large numbers of people leaving government service and it makes it really difficult for them diplomats responder situations like these overseas whether in Saudi Arabia\nScreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu last I I I\nWant to serve our country overseas\nPart thank you or next question is from Paul then asked all forms their land\nHealthcare is a big issue for voters and it has been a focus of both of your campaigns this land your ads accused Mr Roth for voting to eliminate insurance protections for people with preexisting conditions\nAnd cut Medicare my hundreds of billions of dollars which are authors you're accusing Mr lamb and wanted to cut Medicare by eight hundred billion and also keep people from trying experimental drugs\nI Would like each of you to defend your claims and respond to your opponents accusations sightings specific votes started with you Mr left\nThe thank you Paul I'm Glad you asked about this uh because they're the ads have been misleading uh I think what's important here is it it's not so important what we say on screen now or what matters is how we vote\nI have never voted and we'll never vote to cut Medicare uh my opponent can't say the same thing Keith on October fifth twenty Seventeen you voted to cut Medicare by over four hundred billion dollars\nOn march twenty first two thousand Thirteen you voted to cut Medicare about three hundred and fifty billion dollars the leader of your party Paul Ryan has made clear\nThat he intends to pay for the one point five trillion dollar tax cut by coming after Social Security and Medicare my opponent has also voted against the AC a a dozen times that law protects people with preexisting conditions and we need to make sure that that last days on the books or Mr off the sixty seconds\nFirst off power I never said he was going to go after Social Security and Medicare and these are programs that my parents to fend on a you take a look at what the Affordable Care act did the raid on eight hundred billion dollars\nOn Medicare Conor Lamb supports this program and it is he supports fine but I understand what that program did\nThey rated Medicare eight hundred billion dollars to fund a new entitlement program and to expand Medicaid and actually treat people living above the poverty line in that new expansion more favorably than people living below the poverty line\nMr lamb has voted against direct to try to this is a piece of legislation that every single Democrat in the state house in Harrisburg voted for\nIf you and your doctor decided that there is a treatment that you want to try\nAnd and the providers are are in it the government should not be told that\nWe have to grow this economy you tickle if you look at the votes that we had where we have to look for our changes make note of our votes may no changes for him but anybody in or near retirement I Am committed to saving Medicare\nWas lumped you have anything else to say he's the only rate on Medicare is the one you have voted for time and time again hundreds of billions of dollars you have voted to confirm that system what he's talking about is how the Affordable CARE Act\nWould have saved money in the long run by getting people healthcare earlier in their lives that's a good thing again I have not and will not vote to cut Medicare\nWas so kind of you were saying that you're a supporter of the eight hundred billion dollar Medicare cuts is somehow okay\nWe did not cut current recipients or people near retirement\nWe're looking at reforming Medicare long term for nobody who is in retirement now or in your retirement if you like the prescription drug plan that Medicare has right now part the that is a premium support model that actually came in under budget because of the competitive aspects that were built in the party\nSo we're talking to your program that we have a moral obligation to protect\nI Will stand by that program my parents used that program and the number one way to help Medicare is happy thriving growing economy we just learned from the congressional budget office that because of the tax cuts and job that we have actually\nScreaming on W. E. N. imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nPower of economic growth if you want to pay for Social Security and Medicare is the first thing you do as a healthy growing dynamic economy that's what we're delivering and that's what you would not\nGive us the jumping right now and move on to the next question is Elaine effort for Mr office\nMr off is the national debt tops Twenty one trillion dollars for the first time ever\nPresident Trump says he's open to eliminating the debt ceiling and thereby having no limits on federal spending how concerned are you about the national debt and would you support eliminating the debt ceiling\nI Would not support eliminating the debt ceiling I'm always very concerned gonorrhea debt ceiling votes a we have a debt problem in this country and people would have criticized the tax cutting JOBS Act as at into that at the facts matter is if you're really just a half percent more we're going to more than make up\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News ... found as a free rent\nTo community legal services and civil legal assistance for people who are suffering from housing discrimination I got a little experience myself\nDoing that in law school these are agencies that are partially funded by the government and we didn't and make sure that they have the resources they need many of them have told me that they've been strapped for resources in recent years and they can't take on as many clients so I think that's one place we can start thank you Jim anything additional yeah I I\nI guess you can look at housing and understand that the big government regulations that trickled down under the prior administration had a negative impact on minorities seeking to borrow a for a home or as qualified mortgage real or they were just proportionately impacted by that rule so like I remember ...\nYears ago a advocating at actually at polling places or this was on the two thousand for a lecture and we just had to help America vote act and people were showing up and stop they should have been on the rolls and they weren't\nAnd I advocated for people who felt that they were being denied the franchise the right to vote if sacrosanct in this country and we will defend it for everybody Hart thank\nYou were going to move on to our next question this is from Paul then also to congressman laugh\n[noise] feature views accusing your opponent of the in the pocket of special interests or Keith Rothfus campaign ancestral land to twenty five thousand dollars in campaign contributions from corporate executives in a big bank were Mr lambs father as a lobbyist\nA campaign and by Mr lamb accuses Mr office of working for special interest in helping big drug companies going to Fifteen billion dollar tax break all like each of you to respond to these accusations these allegations that you're being overly influenced by special interests started with the ... [noise]\nI accepted contributions from individual people that worked at that back\nAnd they were willing to disclose their identity and they were subject to the same limits as any other citizen of our country I think that's really how they should work\nUh this is a perfect illustration of the difference between the way to keep an eye on our campaigns we both got a similar amount of money from individuals at that back I think I got\nTwenty five thousand and I think he got twenty nine thousand\nThe differences that he also has gotten almost fifty thousand dollars in additional contributions\nFrom the political action committee of that back it's the second fight at the apple\nSo he's a refusal to take corporate pac money and the only solution we need in campaign finance reform no but one thing that if they'll do is it prevents the wealthy from getting these two bites at the apple through their own contributions and then through their second political action committee that's what's different about our campaigns disruptive shift sixty seconds\nI think it shows the hypocrisy here because the facts about her is and you can talk about over six years we see those contributions\nBut the fact the matter is the maximum amount of money somebody can get from like a corporate pack is five thousand dollars from a single individual you're gonna get fifty four hundred dollars and when you combine all the executives together it can be far in excess of that\nSo that the ad that Mr lamb was running was implicated ... somehow take a corporate pack checked ... or you don't have integrity\nAnd so the idea is that look you can get far more money from from any number of sources than a simple five thousand dollar corporate packed contribution for foreign elections or\nLook we need to to understand that when you get a contribution it may or may not affect you vote for me it doesn't you know people support me because of my positions I have actually voted against pieces of legislation that people who did give me a contribution to want to read about this I take that some of these major spending bills\nThis Ross Suffolk follow one of the allegations when Mr lambs ad has to do with you\nScreaming on W. E. N. imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nFor the tax cuts in JOBS Act to actually uh um because I there was never any specific legislation that was designed to benefit a drug company has amazing Mr land can educate on us on that\nAnd that is the case or the tax cuts that they passed last year gave huge advantages to drug companies that are already making killer plot profits in this economy they're charging people way too much but I think the difference here is simple we found our campaigns very differently but we need to be talking about is how over the course of the past year\nOur campaign has raised over seven million dollars and the average contribution\nIs twenty eight dollars these contributions are coming from individual citizens ah were subject to limits we're giving in small amounts as they can afford it\nKeeps us taking more money from that back then me he and I voted the same way on the bill that he talks about a ... it's it's not a different the difference is cooler we reaching too for support in my case it's real people giving their hard earned money for him move onto the next question from Elaine effort for Mr ... the current\nFederal minimum wage to seven dollars and twenty five cents per hour and has not increased since July twenty nine\nGiven a growing number of people working two jobs to make ends meet and the widening gap between the haves and the have nots what do you think about raising the federal minimum wage\nUh you got to be very careful before you're one size fits all your parts of uh the district were actually the natural minimum wages wages already\nRising but because of this healthy economy we have seen because of the tax cuts and jobs many local companies on their own\nWays their minimum wage and so you got to be very careful depending on the community where you are what are you an assault off that bottom rung on the ladder you don't want to do that in a healthy growing economy is lifting wages already we're seeing first real wage growth\nAnd if you talk about people who are having to work two jobs part of that is actually the function of the Affordable CARE Act\nThat limited uh twenty nine and a half or so the people who only work twenty nine and a half hours because the employer mandate that once you hit thirty hours\nBut you have to buy health insurance for that person and so you have people working multiple part time jobs rather than working in a single part time job or or a single fulltime job because of the negative consequences of what the AC aided\nViscerally [noise] just to answer your question directly seven dollars and twenty five cents is a poverty wage the minimum wage absolutely have to go up it should get to Fifteen dollars an hour I don't believe it can or should get their overnight especially not everywhere but we need to design the policy to get there\nAnd once it's there I think that the minimum wage should be indexed to inflation so that we don't get so far behind again ah one of the problems with the economy that congressman Rob this keeps talking about ... uh tonight is sure it's growing\nBut the number of people who are earning twelve dollars an hour is growing too\nThe number of people who are on earning Fifteen dollars an hour is growing and their wages are not going up at least they're not going up as fast as the cost of health care of childcare of housing and so we need a whole set of policies that will help people in that position and we have not gotten that in the last two years apart thank you both our next question from Chris Potter for Mr lamb\nYes you have both in the past expressed wariness about impeaching president Donald Trump at least based on what we know now that I'm sure I don't have to tell you that a key function of Congress has to provide some check and balance some oversight of the executive branch\nAre there areas other than the Russian collusion investigation where you think more congressional scrutiny and legislative push back his ...\nScreaming on WGN recorded by Nike Mellon University integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu last I I I\nListened to pursue these investigations what should people kept\nMy do Chris I think any Congress no matter which party is in charge and has the job of overseeing the executive branch is our duty soldier speak from my own experience among two committees in Washington one of the science committee and once the veterans committee on science committee I absolutely think we have to investigate what's been happening at the EPA\nThey are chasing out career scientist and I don't think there is a good reason for it\nOn the veterans committee or we're going to have bipartisan oversight of a huge contract that was awarded to do with electronic medical records in the VA system largest project of its time or if it goes well it will be a model for the rest of the nation if it goes poorly there are a lot of taxpayer dollars at risk and veterans will not be taken care of\nSo I guess this is my way of saying\nAre frame of mind needs to be about protecting the people under our jurisdiction protecting the veterans have thought about which parties in charge was throughout this\nAbsolutely wherever constitutional software to conduct oversight of the administration we continue to conduct oversight about the department of justice\nI'd ask for the de classification of documents related to that Pfizer application\nUh but you take a look at other agencies federal Housing Administration and under the tenure of Mr walk\nWe have to hold a agencies accountable I think we can ask a lot of questions about what's going on for example in Afghanistan we've been there for Seventeen years now and it's seems to progress is awfully slow I was able to visit Afghanistan last year on two occasions\nAnd it'd be a blast so it was hard questions so I think no matter who it is in the ... who is in the Congress or the executive branch what should be healthy tension\nBetween those branches unfortunately we know that if the Democrats take over the house of representatives they will grind everything to a halt Maxine Waters is the ranking member of the financial services committee if the Democrats take over she will lead and patron central on the financial services committee\nFor hunting all kinds of ... of document questions subpoenas to the administration that withdrawing the economy to a halt\nPart that you were going to hear from our viewers now through social media our first question from Facebook tonight is this something near and dear to the hearts of every one of the district some veterans continue to have issues with the VA what will you do to help improve the care and consistency of the VHS here in Pennsylvania Mr Mr Ross this your first\nSo again I I think in this very polarized environment\nIt was not a helpful for the president to have made those comments didn't you didn't believe Ford\nThought I I Believe something happened I don't believe what judge Kavanaugh\nSorry thank you our next question from Chris Potter for just a ... [noise]\nYes this is a question about immigration a threat to really to both of you know I'm just throughout this I think in the last the previous debate you spoke warmly about the power of immigration to grow the economy and to shore up for a tax revenues for Social Security [noise]\nBut I'm not so much mistaken you have also voted to a voted in favor of a hard line immigration bill that failed in the house I'm In part because moderate\nOr Republicans were in favor of it but certainly I'm On the other hand uh I Know angered some Democrats um by voting in favor of a resolution praising ah immigrations and Customs Enforcement which is an agency that has been the subject of a lot of complaints about heavy handed tactics so I'm Wondering how you to feel about the the the country's current\nUh immigration policy whether it's working under this administration and how you would change it\nAt all the duck me first well I might disagree with the characterization of that piece of legislation as hard line or it's a number of things I'm On it secured or border\nBeen increased a capacity at our ports of entry I've been to the border I obscene spots where there needs to be a barrier where there is no barrier right now\nAre we know that Ninety percent of the heroin that is coming into this country is coming soon back from Mexico courtesy of the cartels which we must have been much more aggressive\nAbout going after a but we asked for an e verify system into legislation where employers would take a look\nAnd make sure that somebody is eligible we actually gave a legal status to DACA kids ... those who came here\nAs minor as and find themselves in this country uh this is the only country they knew we gave them a legal status that's the first time I really you know here's somebody calling us a hard line bill we're we're we're doing something legally that President Obama said twenty times he didn't have the authority to do\nAnd so you look at the various aspects of this piece of legislation that was a very good starting point\nMr lamb I I think that this bill perfectly illustrates what's wrong in Washington right now immigration is a major problem we need to do some things to fix it top but the Republican majority could not even get together and they would not come to the Democratic party for votes or to work with us\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News the sound of a free rent\nThe policy of separating children from their families at the border and instead it would have authorized families to be detained together on military bases I mean we don't need more of that\nUh that was a hard line bill and that's why so many Republicans not Keith Rothfus but so many other Republicans voted against it and it failed uh my sense from campaigning last year is that people overwhelmingly support to things better border security we agree on that\nAh and giving the DACA kids a path to citizenship these are kids who were brought here through no fault of their own\nThey pay taxes they've gone to school they're doing their living successful lives are contributing to this growing economy are we need to finally give them a path the path that was in that bill was long and it was unrealistic it was not necessary to do what they did we could have a simple built to fix this problem but we have not gotten it\nHard to take your next question here the fall of course yeah I was just curious about it if you could assert the reasons for why you would support that resolution in favor of ice which I mean there are many Democrats who favor abolishing and there have been concerns about sort of overreach by that agency in particular\nI think the problem here is mostly with Congress and our failure to address the legal status of all these people that are living here in our country and contributing ah and we have not given people the path to citizenship that they should have a if a government agency is not doing the right thing\nThe answer is not to abolish it these are hard working men and women who are part of law enforcement they're just like the people I used to work with we need a change at the top or near wouldn't abolished the marine corps if they lost a certain value or you didn't like how they perform you'd relieve the general and appoint somebody else and that may be what we need to do here in the last\nWord and I want to spend with that because uh um we take a look at what what we did for DACA in this particular piece of legislation it provided a legal status twenty times President Obama said he didn't have the authority to do this well he went and did it without legal authority we actually gave legal authority\nAnd if you want to have a path to citizenship to be fair\nYou have to treat people the same from their native country and I think I just heard Muslim talk about a broad based a honesty program if he wants to take people who are not legally including folks hundred doctor right now and just say yeah you can come on and give them a path to citizenship that is not fair to people have been doing it so legal way\nBy giving people a legal status right now\nYou're you're you're allowing them to be here come out of the shadows pay taxes contribute to this economy and if you want to become a citizen it's very simple\nLook to see what folk singer native country are doing and you can participate in there and one of the things we did with the with the piece of legislation is to convert a fifty five thousand visa lottery program to a skills based program which many talk of people would qualify for it and\nIt's hard to move on to our next question this is for Terry gripping for Mr lamb\nTo land let's talk about coal our current administration is committed to helping the coal industry rolling back the number of environmental regulations in imposing tariffs on imported solar panels\nThat question is what role for the call and they play in the energy sector and for how long and would you be willing to sponsor legislation and the next Congress making the renewable energy tax credit permanent if so why not\nSure I'd have to look at that specific piece of legislation but it sounds like something I Would support as I've said I think the government\nHas a role to play in creating a market for renewable energy people are demanding it and we can assist just the same way that the government helped create a market for aviation after World War two based on the technology we develop the same way that the government helped out trucking by doing the interstate highway system and the same way\nScreaming on W. E. N. appointed by Nike Mellon University integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu last I I I\nUh I'm not someone who opposes coal in all forms right now uh because at the top of my priority list are the jobs and livelihoods of our working families\nMany of whom still work in the fossil fuel industry and so what I Believe is that if we're going to address the changing market which is already going in favor of renewable energy sources we need to be serious about the job training and job opportunities that we are going to provide\nA one of the critiques I had a President Obama's plans and regulations as I don't think they did enough to preserve jobs and create new jobs I didn't they talked about it but we've seen before these job training programs that end with the people piece of paper they need and with the job we need to be bold and we need to be serious about the job the middle class families Missouri was your response\nThere's some three hundred families right now have you ever county I worry about whether that plants out there is going to stay open a this is the legacy of a long sustained assault on the industry yes natural gas is a success story and that is helping to [noise] to ah the provide more power more abundant power but\nCheap abundant reliable electricity is what power as power that the rising of living standards across this country and across the world\nAre you mentioned the renewable you know we've been waiting since Nineteen Ninety two I think for the wind industry to actually turn a profit without being heavily subsidized by the taxpayers\nThat's the problem here we we continue to pick winners and losers in the industry we know what happened was cylinder a there's a a huge solar projects out to California desert called Ivan ... again subsidized by the taxpayers and it's not producing\nWe know that cheap abundant reliable electricity is what powers ... uh I have supported research on clean coal of the national energy technology laboratory bike here in the south hills is doing great work we want to continue to fund research to make sure that we can continue uses great resource that we have our thank you our next\nQuestion is from all of it though and this one is for Mr office\nThis raw says that endorsed by the national Rifle Association your opponent Mr lamb has taken positions on the gun issue that are consistent with those taken by the end All right can you or Mr lamb get any examples any specific examples where are you differ with the n._r._a. on its approach to preventing mass shootings in America\nWell number one I think the an array supports me because I support the second amendment\nAnd we have taken steps this Congress we're fix the background check system there were the records that were not being uploaded this was the case with the Virginia tech shooter or we have added funding for the background check system\nI voted for the stop ... stop school violence act to make sure our schools can have more resources to identify where there might be a problem and it take measures\nAnd significantly the mental health legislation that was so needed to make sure that people who who are having trouble from a ... perspective or getting the resources they need before we start to criminalize the behavior of responsible law abiding citizens we want to make sure that a law will have an impact\nUm ... I I I recall was a ton of the lambs first ad in the ... election you know using a gun and an ad you know this isn't the context of the shootings that we're going around the country I don't think that was responsible look gun ownership is serious and we want to make sure that we're keeping those guns out of the hands of people who should not have them\nFor slim we agree that law abiding gun owners should be able to keep their guns and should be able to use them safe way at firing range is like I did and I I there's nothing wrong with that at all\nThe difference in our positions is that I favor commonsense gun reform which the n._r._a. has long opposed are there examples one of which is the public safety in second\nScreaming on W.
