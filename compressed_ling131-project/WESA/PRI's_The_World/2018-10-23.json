time\nHappy to talk to you Michael\nYesterday President Trump announced that he would make cuts in U.S foreign aid for three Central American countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThey've been receiving the said since twenty sixteen and it's expected to go down by nearly forty percent in twenty Nineteen that means cutting tens of millions of dollars in financial assistance to the region we wanted to know what that eight actually goes to\nSarah appears is with the migration Policy Institute in Washington so what has this aid been used for what what was it earmarked for and how was it used\nTo use very wide variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the northern triangle country and the alliance for prosperity this is a program that arose out of a separate migration crisis that we had in two thousand fourteen when a lot of company and child migrants arrived at our southern border\nPresident Obama at that time and knowledge that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root cause and and look at what's going on in these countries to cause people to to flee and and really have this mass exodus\nThe alliance for prosperity is designed to increase economic prosperity and other countries and strengthen institutions they consider it a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into this country is and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to it to end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador Ken the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress just slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but now he cannot do that you know laterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries have really need to wait until they come back in session after November\nAnd Sarah how political do see that this move being ...\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet the Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nYeah absolutely\nPresident Trump ran on immigration he saw that issue when him the election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the mid term\nSo this caravan effectively as a political gift to him and Republicans in that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country to quote unquote from this care of and\nA Trump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala ... about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle country and Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we have a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think will will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those reforms to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for certain reforms to the asylum system including changing asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like this care of and so that and it operates more efficiently 'cause right now if if anyone in the care of and apply for asylum\nThey'll likely be placed in our immigration court backlog which stretches on for years so waiting in the United states and then way down the line\nAnd immigration court judge will have to pick up their case and started from scratch and see if it's insincere asylum application\nIn reality we'd like to see it a more efficient system operating at the southern border so where we're working really hard to to
