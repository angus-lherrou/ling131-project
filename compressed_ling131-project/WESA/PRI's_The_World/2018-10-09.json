sexual assault and harassment that may have helped some women in the hotel industry achieve that goal they've been fighting for for a long time getting their employers to do more to protect them from sexual assault\nThis made headlines a few years back when a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss Kahn the former head of the IMF of sexual assault that case was settled out of court but the problem never went away here's the world's Alison at at a\nImagined that you're a woman working in an office and you're in the middle of the meeting all of a sudden your meal coworker starts to undress it's hard to imagine that happening right well if your hotel housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not three times and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm gonna

every day\nWith Tony and other housekeepers in the union set up to survey more than five hundred women about their experiences on the job\nNearly sixty percent of women they talked with dealt with some form of assault by hotel guest that lead to action last year house keepers in Chicago successfully lobbied for a device to keep them safe it's called the panic button\nAnd it was part of a city wide campaign known as hands off pants on\nSo this is one solution [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's it's send a message this I was in danger in the room\nThat's already full Hoge she's the head of housekeeping

worked at the housekeeper\nHer story is not uncommon according to a study done by the American immigration council the top occupation for foreign born women here in the U. S. is housekeeping\nWith nearly nine hundred thousand women working in this sector\nFor judge having the panic button has made her and her staff safer I honestly think is a great team 'cause it is great the Chicago hotels are required to give this device to housekeepers but sexual assault in the hotel industry is a global issue so what are some of these larger\nChains like Mary auto tuned to keep their workers safe say in Paris or Dubai\nThere's such heightened awareness around safety and security so we're dialing up in the space but I think it's important to remember there is no one magic answer\nThat's Erica Alexander she's the chief lodging services officer from Marriott International she's talking about the new devices they're rolling out in the U.S and Canada but the company has no current plans to put panic buttons into the hands of their workers in other countries\nThat are a huge problem because we understand that you know the Mariette brand should be doing the right thing whether they're here in the United states around the world\nThat can be fined gold she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers from Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working in South Africa and around the globe to push for hands off pants on campaign\nHappening here in the United states and Mary I can do it here in the United states they can do it in China where they had a ... they can do it throughout Asia Latin America\nBefore the me too movement last year house keepers like with Tony I didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety on the job [noise] they've been trying for years to get their employers to protect them\nAnd then all of a sudden all of this stuff started showing up in the news and I'm just like this is incredible on my because ... like we we all have to say like we've started something\nAnd they have five of the major hotels\nDreaming on W.

...\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\n[noise]\nOoh [noise]\n\nGathering intelligence can take you to the far end of the earth remote villages in Russia for example but getting into can also be as easy as going online and doing a few searches the investigative news website spelling cat and the insider did both\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity a one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G argue Russian Army intelligence\nOur told her as one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had really about the cover daddy said this guy so we now know his real name is Alex ... before he was ... and I was out on her Petra which was his cover it and it was totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under\nUm and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is a very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise] I'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information or discover identity from his real identity [noise] so we looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they are to link the databases\nFrom driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find a few years now where to look inside cross referenced everything we can try and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan at the same birth dates and disarm roughly the same village in the middle of nowhere and northern Russia\nAnd after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to this tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ on before he went to medical school yeah he was he a DJ at the local club one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village\nSo we once these hunters in these databases of cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think would probably matched the true identity of Michigan\nI got to say some of the steps in in your process uh you and your investigators are really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of um any vulnerabilities of what would leave a paper trail from a spy on Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all been forged in his new way forever but again these spies have real lives to they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to them so\nYeah I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy Ware it but it was very very basic routine research on this stuff you wanted and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for an interesting details a cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the ... which went first glance it's absolutely insane like why would a secret spy lift his public address like on a driver's license that address of the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA [noise] well he did it because uh you know if you get\nScreaming on WGN

as the headquarters of the ... which went first glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy lift his public\nAddress like on a driver's license to address the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA\n[noise] well he did it because uh you know if it gets pulled over in his car the cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually you know everything's me up and up you can just go you know\nYou're fine so um that we ran the address um traffic database we found that three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nWho all have the same register to address for gift says one address in Moscow so all these men to almost certainly are often you that you are you\nAnd they all listed their vehicle registration as his address who they just don't want to get traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get pulled over for drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services so really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news and treat me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy knows so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and us but intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose that always possible right because we know every time any investigation or make Russia people always chimed in and saying well they wanted you to find the right well if they want us to find a wife no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registration traded vehicles they're looking to share your headquarters\nYou know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agency address same like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\nA few weeks ago your website building cat identified as a second person allegedly involved with this ... poisoning I have authorities in the u._k. or anywhere else been in touch with you about your findings\n[noise] uh no no no not really I mean I don't really have any I don't think Elliot our founder has any contacts with UK police either um\nSo we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in Salt completely news and then we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spy and the digital age\nIt depends I I again I I have no idea I've never worked in the intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's much much harder than ever been before\nThat was our solar with the new site a
