minister Austin spiritual Santos and just as in those areas in Brazil are clear majority Brazilians here cast votes in the primary earlier this month for both so NARAL\nMr Bush so NATO is a tapping on

ahead of the midterms they're concerned in some states about efforts to suppress living\nNorth Dakota for example that's where the stand and vote campaign comes in it seeks to encourage turnout and voter registration among Native Americans\nActor mark ... is part of the stand and vote campaign American part of the protests and sit ins that went on in North Dakota against the Dakota access

W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nI worked with uh in in New York were native people and when Standing Rock was happening or I was invited to to come and stand with my native brothers and sisters to protect their water\nSo now you've given it a bit uh still working with with a native ... and getting out the vote I Know standing voting it is a campaign geared toward native populations in the U.S and in a a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota vote voter id law what does that law sang\nIt basically says that ah unless you have a a street address on your id in North Dakota you aren't a lot about\nMost of the people who live on reservations don't\nActually have a a a physical street address they use PO box is\nSo now that the Supreme Court has upheld that law what can people on reservations North Dakota do are coming up on midterms say\nYou know they can they can give them the general St ... a street address 'em through the uh the NATO council through the tribal council in each reservation\nI I'm just curious if you're an actor and I I just wondered you call on different strengths their talents or in your activism than than in your acting career\nThis is a function that are just are just seven starkly perform bringing light to uh those issues that um that are in the dark and um whether you're doing it on a on a stage or with ideas of play right you're doing it a movie with um\nWith the struggles of human beings and storytelling or you're doing it directly indirect\nAction um like standing at Standing Rock Occupy Wall street or getting involved with the campaign or the fight against the war in Yemen\nUm these are part of the functions of being an artist and a something that I I put a lot of good faith in\nMark ... is an actor an activist he's involved with the stand and vote campaign an effort to get the vote out among Native Americans in North Dakota thank you so much mark\nThank you so happy to talk to you [noise]\n\nJefferson I Want to come back to you for this final issue which is about ... eavesdropping something that a German Chancellor Angela Merkel experienced herself\nThe news this week is that China and Russia has been routinely eavesdropping on President Trump's phone conversations what are the parallels with what happened to under Merkel\nThere certainly are some parallels\nI mean what sort of different about the reporting is that uh with ... it was almost like how\nCould are good friends and allies be doing this to us if you talk to people off\nThe record you know not on camera they would say yeah we all know that this sort of stuff goes on all the time we know that all major countries eased drop and spy on one another but they shouldn't be doing in such open crass ways\nThat seems to have gotten a bit last year you know it's sort of being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody and hasn't generated nearly as much heat as say the letter bomb story which is\nThe reaction that Kristof described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that happened here where they're saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension that's generating a lot more passionate way each than the thought that someone's a hack Donald Trump's I saw\n[noise] now I Can't have a journalist from Germany and eternal is from Greece in an interview without asking above you know your two countries have had some tensions in recent years you know over ... and that kind of thing I mean how how your country is getting along these days [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I I think it's\nA love affair slowly slowly liftoff from our prime minister miss the cheaper who um was elected in two thousand troops theme with tens of thousands of people gathering in the center\nOf options on the repeating off him he's very famous Chun ... go home\nHe hates to\nAn end at the beginning of this kind of relation between ... cheaper was ah was always at the core of our attention as journalists how easy possibly going to run through when you first meet in the European Union um\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nBegan between them and it was not of course a lot of the book there by any means but it was certainly a kind of a mother towards the child so she she\nToo hard to educate him in the way it used to live stroke peacefully come here come to this room ... by also sometimes their lives to it\nWe know knowledge you respect true very very much the situation of the relationship between the two countries I think it was um quite good\nJefferson how does it feel in Berlin yeah I I Would pretty much agree\nWith that so I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany so just commands or tension here probably as much as we command there the tension there but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get their\nEconomic problems under control they basically done what's the Germans have asked to them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou know ... medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know I mean compared to like Victor all bond in Hungary you know I'm a going out for a meal which puts the prime minister of Greece is probably a walk in the park\nIf I may just add another five but I'm sure that are just some news about that as well we we lost from a German my my favorite football team or just lost one by immune to those are really ready\nFor both [laughter] I top awfully that up our\nFuel costs eight million euros but it caused a hundred million so that gives me\n[laughter] journalists Christos ... is in Athens Jefferson chases the Dutch valley in Berlin I Want to thank you both for being with us today I'm happy to know\n\nOur next story is about a part of immigrant life in the U.S that sometimes goes unnoticed is the fact that immigrant workers are more educated than ever before they're just as likely to hold a bachelor's\nDegree as us citizens but often that education doesn't cross over which prevents people from continuing the careers they had back home are part of Ashley clique noticed this imbalance in the nursing world where there is a labor shortage but she also found programs trying to bridge the gap\nFinance handed me the phone was working as a nurse in Haiti and the massive
