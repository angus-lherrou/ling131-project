coordinating their activity either because they're automated like botnets or their little armies of humans trying to spread a message intentionally as quickly and as broadly as possible\nUm and so these are the characteristics that we associated with foreign influence operations but there again being done by folks who I think assume that they're just kind of hustling to get their message out as political operatives even if it's a little shady or a little disingenuous\nAnd in terms of foreign actors or Russia doesn't surprise me but but what are Iran and Israel up to\nVery similar things similar to Russia we see these networks of accounts focused on their foreign policy objective but what's interesting is that when there's a really contentious domestic issues here in the U.S like the capital nomination for example they do\nTurn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue kind of sowing discord which is again really similar to what we saw on twenty sixteen\nOr are these campaigns are targeting specific races and specific states\nEven in races that have been very high profile\nFor example the crews ... Senate race in Texas for a while there is a lot of social media engagement around that rates and there are some\nTactics being used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and in those races\nGenerally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw and the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done\nWhat we're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect\nCertain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that for an actress can operate through real Americans and op you'd skate their activity\nUm and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very divisive and\nAnd the more device if they can make that conversation the better in the cabin on nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course\nThat's been a a very sort of an open wound for

with fact checkers are on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend to our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S\nThey are and I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct\nBut what we think about if this information is actually less about the truth or the authenticity in any given story and more about how it's distributed\nIs the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative at one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify this sort of manipulative distribution [noise]\nI I just want to ask you about the the news today a department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti
