to from the Israeli ambassador to the U.S a Ron ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nOf the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and no advance of anti Semite so usually not neo Nazis on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's on civil rights or whether it's on similar yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews as we know from hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much about a domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic policies and supporting till it was really due to the Trump support Israel to Trump's support the strong Israel so I'm ... comments I think perplexed American Jews than they do Israeli Jews\nDina told me a bit about reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI'm over all although there has been expressions of ... persons of shocking to hire the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand\nThe impact that has had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the plays the synagogue life for American June they don't understand that or American Jews a synagogue is a second home at the place where kids grow up and Hebrew school\nWhere they hide as I did like you know hiding out from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play and kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I put a share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that was when he was shot\nAnd and after the memorial in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream order Scottish which is a Jewish prayer memorial I think the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the cash and that is traditionally a time and only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day they will\nDreaming on W E s say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\nStood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um that standing out to the standing up together is such a metaphor and I think overall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a cynic I shouldn't Jewish community because they had their just unity\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls of the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nDina this tragedy does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker here\n[noise] me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews are two very different paths right now to say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves\nVery much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant would just\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to not that you know American Jews have done fairly wealthy themselves in in America and feel fairly successful and feel very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lead them to sort of\nBe more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews steal steal under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product of sort of post traumatic has Holocaust world where they look at things very much in terms of the earth on game it times you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know I'm French\nFrom within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think it should just divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlights those splinters\n[noise] reporter Dina crop

passionate defender of coral reefs ...\nWhen you look at organisms and um you look at a coral reef clearly we're losing well Karl ... than we would hope and that means the rates of changing the environments have essentially I'll have the capacity of the calls themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was so gates was one of the very first scientists to make the connection between coral bleaching and global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days when none of us understood what what's going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pay lanes and she was able to tie it to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her death gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adapt to warming oceans friend Virginia was says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI remember her ability to light up a room and make everyone in the room feel like sheep\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nEyebrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of corals and she was brilliant at if she really excelled at it\n[noise] I Know you've described her as an iconoclastic or feel wives\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of\nAssisted evolution of corals to very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster\nTo be able to tolerate the heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and but others led by roots really feel that we need to try a variety of options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly shoes and iconoclast in terms of\nThe way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues decide to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world a coral clients a more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help these coral reefs are in the face of the past few years several major Corey bleaching events\nAnd the rest of the news isn't good I mean coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades and yet Rick Gates remained so optimistic how did she retain that optimism most studying something so depressing well it's\nSuch a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her law she just looked forward and she felt like\nYou know we control our hands up and give up or we can look for solutions than I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates [noise] her laugh\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that field around people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean general and she laughed she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State university and
