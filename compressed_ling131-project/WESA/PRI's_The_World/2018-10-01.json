Africa's security correspondent joined us from Nairobi a really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually crack this case\n[noise] well I think first of all it was just the the shock that gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning\nAnd it began you know just conversations across to each other with different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is so anybody have any idea\nWhat the what the terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started and lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a full on the investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology play in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean there are parts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be any way and the ... which is why it across west in Central Africa a botched\nWith many heads put together a one of them was Amnesty International the rights of group

I\nHad put together at one of them was Amnesty International the rights group which had been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know\nLooking at the uniforms listening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was camera and this was northern capital of course that's also a vast\nRegion but over time trying to match the topography as you could see in the video there said some distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and using those rich lines matching them to Google a digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location\nThat's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that rich fine match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only original and that has that shape and all of Cameron\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy bought the ... so many clues put together so it's not just the rage line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue and you have another clear you sort of bring them together\nAnd that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed was his when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that un adding everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also worked with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experience and this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible [noise]\nWell first of all the government tried to deny initially that these ... soldiers they said you know the uniform on was not watch\nUm the the soldiers would wear up north um they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army also found some of the the uniforms\nBoy indeed calmer when you're in military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and found that does work I'm ruining soldiers but then in the dialogue is well some of the soldiers were saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy\nBut around the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tone and said well they had the rest of it than people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official names and so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details\nOf your parents still you know you've found church on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier called ... and apart from just to Facebook you know we found a will to speak to a former kind of ruined young soldier who also confirmed that this was indeed Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these are women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR

children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to these uh women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated\nBoko Haram and there's a point where I Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of\nA tells this child that um you know sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and\nUm basically saying it's it's your parents' fault that you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers are no forwarding these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback to this investigation has a BBC Africa gotten from the public like from Cameron in Nigeria itself [noise]\nThe feedback has been overwhelming and people of all walks of life from around the world responding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by the message you know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the\nAngle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fired up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that mall can come out a cameraman and people in particular but I've been calling for more to be done to hold their their government and their forces accountable\nVideo or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to uh to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen it festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nThe tent camp is you know pretty remote it's very far\nFrom El Paso which I think the closest city there's not a lot of vegetation is just you know I think the picture's really speak for themselves they're rows and rows of tents that are that children living quarters or they have a couple other facilities on site in dining facilities and the like but\nBut it you know it is remote and it and\nIt feels like you're kind of in the middle of the other\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on that how how does it do the\nYou know let's say that a child was moves from essentially where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty children so much more of a homey environment they have access to education so they'll received some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects learn some English they'll also\nHave regular attention they'll have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist [noise] a lot of these children are suffering you know I may have experienced trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving and or possibly route and so and so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the accent that they need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like twenty or emergency to thirty we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work books but\nThat's not a educate and yet not far cry from classrooms\nDreaming on W. E. S. A. is supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program at\nCMU dot edu flash I I I\nAccept that they need to and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like twenty of emergencies instability we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education um the the kids you know we were told the kids get work walks but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of melt mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc it's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it but you know\nThey've just been transition there from a different ... and they don't know anyone there disoriented you know there possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um it's quite stable I think\nYou're a member of mine kind of boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent\nShelters are provided with an you know no you're right presentation um they receive screening and so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues [noise] um\nYou know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the time came facility and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMinimum the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we have a system we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in the country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment in the system there is a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nOr those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the process doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not a ... it's not a long term it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I I Am hopeful in the sense that I think I'm I'm I'm\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know\nDoing what it is it certainly is a different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from from a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously it's one thing to have that versus\nYou know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsors as soon as possible\nTrouble as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much\nPresident Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency this change what essentially mean anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by access and government benefits\nScreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on the master's program\nAt the end news dot edu flash I I I\nAnd nine months one of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency\nThis change would essentially mean anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen that happening but Lucy is a pediatrician in Washington a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule is a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services\nThat include healthcare Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to childhood family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still in the proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future and this includes even opting out of programs again like snap and even ... or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for since a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you can tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so\nAs recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as with many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so she's also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula if needed or food assistance but she declined I'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S\nSo I worry about this baby and many babies and similar situation to start in their lives without all the support\nThat they could get if their families were not being placed in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either stability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family\nScreaming on W.
