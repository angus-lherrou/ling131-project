was told us that roughly seven hundred hundred had arrived yesterday and so the idea of a caravan as one might think of it is not really accurate it feels to me more like an ounce of thousands of people traveling right now to the Mexico Guatemala border\nI mean it sounds just like a very long line of people as many as four thousand though I mean that that's pretty dramatic\nIt's completely a dramatic where I was last night was at a municipal sports that are that was like a basketball court was bleachers and they were just hundreds of people in it sleeping\nEating and it was loud and it

why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on no one this was a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against their own government and president out on himself so that's why that particularly in range die thing\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which although the sudden diplomatic deference they do have different since considerable difference it\nAnd so now you see in the program columnist quite a lot of\nSpilling out a

supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agency is called to track climate an extreme weather costs by saying no thanks actually they did say all of them are they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not war at that time and money expended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that was correct\nTrevor how there is with the economic research company rodeo group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible but thanks to a lot of research work over the past few years we can do it\nScientists still don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change but they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate change or that Fifteen Percent more main felt during the hurricane\nCombining that new science with big economic data lets people like Hauser estimate how much climate change will cost

Thirty years ago and how much more likely it will be in the future and what the price tag of\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites

not a drop the resolution\nGuardian reporter ... thank you thank you\nSpeaking of things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this t._v. show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality cop show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who are\nWorking against the terms of of their views in Japan and stake out people you're there with them in the car um they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggested to port in the next plane type bang\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\n... which I guess translates a scotch at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show or in Japan called a Tylenol shoe guy which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada where I'm from for example uh we had a show like this but a kind of the border services agency cooperated with with the producers and actually the Canadian government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless\nAnd it was only taken off the air because of the uh there'd be contravene privacy regulations in Canada\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breathless um you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening and it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and and bright and pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to the\nThe dormitory were some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out going to move as sort of marriage\nAnd so it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there is a a camera you know you're driving down the road it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also have\nScreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program [noise]\nThe any dot edu slashed I I I\nConcluded that like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you showed the neighborhood um the people who live there would probably complain and ... criticized and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out images you can't see people's faces voices are describes it was quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is it a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be a because uh the the program did to cooperate with the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to immigration agency and get more resources I assume is going to be somewhere your efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have activists been saying [noise]\nWell I mean yeah I like on line there was considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said why are you dreading those into the entertainment like why why are you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstay their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it'd be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and taking our jobs type thing so I I personally I sure like uh I think it's just a kind of aware of sensational kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing\nYeah I mean I I guess you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for\nBrexit or invasion of Crimea so many people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country and so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that\nSomeone's doing
