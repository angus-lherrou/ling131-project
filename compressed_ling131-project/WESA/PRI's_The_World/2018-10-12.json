am eastern time and then about two and a half minutes into flight we got indication that\nSomething had gone wrong with the booster and if you're watching a live stream you could see that they were joking about kind of violently and there was some kind of break up in flight and that\nInitiated the emergency abort sequence and the capital that they were writing on performed what's known as a ballistic reentry and that's when you come in and much steeper angle when you land on earth\nI think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth's gravity so pretty intense flight

ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start throwing up and I believe they're about\nThirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to do with the fact that there were\nNo longer connected with the

the earth or yeah they are [laughter]\nGod I've done what is known as a parabolic flight that's when you see a weightlessness for a moment to time\nAnd during the ... experience ... and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress I didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\nAre there any new details about what might have causes problem I don't know if they've trades\nThe exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separations so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters\nAround the center core and they were supposed to break away but rush into things that maybe there was some contact\nBetween one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the\nMoment [noise] none of us in Russia there frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics enter now it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that\nKind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has\nHad an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station I Would say\nIt's definitely concerning about the nation's future we currently have three astronauts into orbit on the station and they are going to have to come home eventually day got up there and it's way as as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a two hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days\nInto that so there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so\nEither they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty phrase capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen\nIt just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren brushes
