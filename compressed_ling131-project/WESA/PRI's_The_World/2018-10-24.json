been pretty tense between the U.S and China and not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nThere contesting America's geopolitical advantages and trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie rights which I go on column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nIt doesn't have to be on China is extremely keen that it should not be they don't even want to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one and work out what\nAmerica wants but it used to be just a few hard liners here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiated with the America wanted to contain China and still China's rise\nThat fringe of hardliners is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints\nThey look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether there was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great soup or are the top of his of economic chosen poll America

Beijing last week and it was all off the record like on the name but he was a kind of a household name in this day and he comes to trying to ... for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having interview Trump the times about China went understood in\nDC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there was something to this that\nThe problem is that the machine in Washington has kind of systematic structural things that it wants China to do differently to play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco to you know to what was something like the TPP where everyone opens their markets that will\nDonald Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ID so I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if\nYou know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent\nTo the rest of the world to access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump stock in his real estate bases he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states and it's time to review the rent and it's not very pleasant so the guy on the other side of the table\nBut there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you paid a lot more rent I I think that's the core of walked on Trump is up to right now\nWhat is China's vision for the world\nHe's a really interesting thing the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China China is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly\nClear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and go and you know broadly that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nThat's the go how'd they get that is not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one policy looks block they'll try another if there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries\nAnd and for a long time they gave me the world trading system in and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months several trade tensions and you get this when he talked to a European government leaders who've been talking to the Chinese because it's in Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike\nMorals and an American led worlds trading older is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gave me the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they do want to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are quite in the order of reforming the WTO no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of\nThis will be moving costs where you could actually see something quite positive\n... is the problem is that you can also see some very negative kind of forces that crude feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction or I'm absolutely confident that the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ...
