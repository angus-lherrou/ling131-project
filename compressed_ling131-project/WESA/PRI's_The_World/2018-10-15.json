more you realize you don't know\nThis kind of thing happens to all of us this moment when we learn something new that makes everything so much harder and more complicated than we thought and then we have to decide if we're going to take that in our turn away\nThis happens a lot with climate change as we learn about how our own actions are impacting the climate for some of us it can get so overwhelming that will grab on to any alternative story anything that helps us just to turn away\nAnd one of those stories is actually related to this story it's a narrative that says the planet is heating up because of changes in ... and other natural processes not our carbon pollution\nYou may have heard this yourself and wondered could there be anything to that so let's take a quick look first of all\nThe earth's climate does of course change naturally the planet has always fluctuated between ice ages and warmer periods and changes in ... are part of what drives that pattern\nBut those changes play out over tens or even hundreds of thousands of years\nThe warming we're experiencing now is happening at lightning speed in comparison we can measure it in decades and the cause of that warming is clear it's us burning fossil fuels moves carbon into the atmosphere and not traps more heat this is a fact\nSo we have a choice do we try to push it aside so that we don't have to
