they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on rent some rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nI mentioned the John Day you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember about that myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands\nAnd the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as evil as you might think even though he had seen them murder somebody very much a\nLot of them as victims of circumstances the way the specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and

of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and to fight his throat just teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the

this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nHe started imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was and we took gases and it turns out I had been five minutes\nAnd I I think that's probably one Tommy change completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on our chief or super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than adults hungry sleep deprived men they get off the communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said here's the deal I'm going to go back up to you guys in Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain among with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nKind of set in a weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously meant that he has the story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook

anyways has Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out he he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain\nNow it was for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there is just as\nBall of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted a scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and the anger named a knife and era move like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of training especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find [noise] uh\nI'm trying to always kinda directs to away that looks like the easiest way but

then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going
