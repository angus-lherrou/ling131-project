swept away entire neighborhoods with an eight to twelve foot storm surge\nMichael is the third strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the continental United States it passed through quickly

nine had lower barometric pressure is a key measure of hurricane strength\nAnd even some storm experts were surprised by\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... found of a free from\nFour and just twenty four hours here to talk about this unprecedented storm and it's possible Climate Connections we welcome another Michael back to the show Michael Mann is a climate expert at Penn State University Welcome back to living on earth Michel\nThanks deep it's good to be with you so why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees\nCelsius above pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or we're looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat wave and an ocean heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the planet\nA hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into the storm surge these days\nWell you know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast has been somewhere between half a foot and a foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy and twenty twelve at at at a ... foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge\nMight sound like a modest amount a one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of coastal flooding it meant several billion dollars worth of additional damage um same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina I got about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will be storms be particularly the hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quick pop up\nOne of the things that we're seeing with warm and warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we've seen this now so many times where a storm balloons\nFrom a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane over the course of a day or two and that only happens over very warm sees and are we getting more\nOf these very intense storm these category ... you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest\nIn fact there's a relationship for a category five storm you get an increase of roughly seven percent\nIn the maximum wind speeds for each degree Fahrenheit warming of the ocean and now that seven percent increase in wind speed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm\nGoes as the third power of the wind speed\nSo it was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential up the storm that's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures if you do the math\nThat means it was probably twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of human caused warming you know the\nIn a governmental panel on climate change report\nIs saying that the world faces perhaps more severe climate impacts of\nGlobal ever surface temperatures rise more than one and a half degrees Celsius both the pre industrial temperatures what do we know now about how hurricanes could behave with the world it's more than one and a half degrees warmer than before the industrial\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAre part of one degree Fahrenheit\nRight there that's a Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storms\nThat means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius you have a about four percent\nMore moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting uh lots of other weather extremes and global sea level rise and all of these other attributes of climate that we are sensitive to\nIn the past the PCC has been the conservative that when the data comes into the projections have been uh been lower than the actual numbers how do you think this report will fare or when the actual data comes in\nYeah so I I criticize this latest report or for once again being overly conservative and its portrayal of the science and and I'll tell you it has to do with a very specific criticism in this case it's the way that they measured the warming that has happened and the PCC has chosen\nTo measure the overall warming that's taken place\nUsing a baseline that starts in the late Eighteen hundreds and and the reason for that is well that's how far back to their mom and her measurements go here's the problem human caused warming began back in the Seventeen hundreds when you know industrialization began so every tenth of a degree Celsius\nOf warming that's happened makes it that much more difficult to stabilize below one point five maybe it's impossible now one point five\nTwo point oh or there's still a clear a path toward stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius but it turns out that if you look at our budget how much carbon do we have left that we can burn in avoid two degrees Celsius if you take in what might sound like a small\nThere's a lot of humble pie each here I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of

story that unfolded in the same New Jersey town over a century earlier\nVineland New Jersey was first settled in the late Eighteen hundreds of utopian experiment and the social issues there as a magic than Barbara Kingsolver his book on sheltered resident equally with America's reality back then and today she joins us now welcome back to living on her\nHi thanks for having me\nBarbecuing so but this is your first novel and what six years so what brought you the idea of writing what became on sheltered now\nWell it's one of those books that took a while to cook\nI spent several years thinking about\nHow to write about paradigm shift that's what I think\nWe're doing right now I think we're in the moment when so many things that we've always believed in as truth unquestionable are suddenly starting to feel not true anymore it's a moment that feels like crisis like\nThe end of the world as we know it and want to say permanent truth things like\nWell like\nThere will always be a job at the end of the college degree or tenure at the end of the track or or a a pension at the end of a career or good health care or even things like ice on the polls\nThat will stay frozen or that there will always be more efficient ... we're reaching a moment in history when\nAll those shelters are failing us\nSo your device if I can use that word of course is to have to families yeah living more than a century apart yeah in the same house\nAll right and of course it's falling down [laughter] you literally is literally falling down and that's another thing that is ...\n... free to pursue the
