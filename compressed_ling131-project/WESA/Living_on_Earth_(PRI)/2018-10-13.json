gasoline primarily for transportation and\nProbably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere\nThat even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards the ... century\nIt seems we going to need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was called for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of\nScientists were skeptical that there would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half two degrees but because the government's call for the report a lot of scientists went out\nAnd started doing research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nAnd flooding that they were big differences between one and a half into degrees I mean give me an example\nAlready by one and a half degrees there are places are particularly islands in the Pacific and megacities all around the world for which the incidence of the benchmark hundred year storm or a hundred year flood event I should call it\nIncreases markedly even by one and a half degrees so that you're getting at that level what is today a one and a hundred year event becomes a yearly event think about that we don't deal with those kinds of events effectively now even though they're very rare what happens when they're happening all the time\nWhat's missing from this report and and tell me why\nThere really isn't much of a\nSocial and political analysis there isn't much discussion of the political and social obstacles there is discussion of the need for transformation but not that much discussion of how you go about it\nIn particular place and this and why it's difficult to do and the reasons for that our number one it's different in every place in the eye PCC can't do a special report for every place on earth\nAnd number two many political leaders had already guarded this as an unpopular thing to do and they don't want to start digging into some of these very basic political reasons so I see the sea did the best they can do given its charge\nWhat gives you hope what makes you an optimist Michael Oppenheimer about climate disruption\nMost optimistic thing is that we've seen a revolution start to happen in the energy system of the world and particularly the U.S where coal for reasons that have nothing to do with climate change by and large\nIs decreasing and important as a fuel in the U.S and increasing penetration of renewable energy into the bark at we're seeing rapid development in the storage capacity particularly for electricity\nFree to explore free to pursue the tree Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nBy the world and particularly the U.S where coal for reasons that have nothing to do with climate change by and large\nIs decreasing and important as a fuel and the U.S increasing penetration of renewable energy into the bark at which the rapid development in the storage capacity\nParticularly for electricity so we're in the middle of that revolution now and with some push from government both of the regulatory front they do the research and development front we to make this happen even faster than it's happening right now so that's one reason for optimism\nAnother is if you step back and look at human history human beings are\nVery clever recreating dangerous masses and then almost as good as cleaning them up afterwards\nAnd allergy which is the most promising one is what happened with the nuclear arms race where we have to put the genie back in the bottle and something could still go wrong\nBut we significantly reduce the risk of a large scale nuclear exchange which is essentially bake the earth on inhabitable and so you know you can look at that it's a way that encouraging I think yeah it is\nThat human beings are smart sometimes that are able to see their mistakes and act collaboratively as countries in the same soup the get out of the soup\nMichael Oppenheimer is a professor of
