over seven point magnitude on the Richter scale\nEvery year at least every year it's vulnerable also to sue nominees and volcanic eruptions so this is a major challenge for the country\nAnd of course I'm a little more than a decade ago there was a huge catastrophic phenomena event there in Indonesia\nYes two thousand for a sitting on me at the tip of northern Sumatra ... and ... literally one in three people in that city were killed\nI was there two and a half months after the tsunami that seeing the devastation and still it was the stench of dead bodies two and a half months it's just sobering and\nIt's this kind of experience that has made me so intent on trying to do what is possible to support decision making for the public managers that these these horrifying situation\nSo I understand that the proposal to get the sensors installed in western so much a stall in fact just a few days before this latest tsunami hit a I guess it was due to funding concerns how did you react

when you heard the news\nI was profoundly disappointed profoundly disappointed\nSo there were two parts to this project one is the undersea network that provides the initial near real time warning and then the second is the network of electronic devices essentially\nA cell phones handheld cell phones that enable people in the community to communicate as they evacuate or move to safer ground\nWe had planned to do the deployment this fall September October the Indonesian agency the M cagey was very interested in this proposal you know unfortunately the project is currently on hold until more funding comes in\nSo it's like that everybody agreed that people should wear seatbelts but that wasn't enough money for everyone to have one unfortunately that's exactly the case as I understand that there was a system of bullies there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful parts of this project um Indonesia\nSupported by the U.S in Germany had twenty two movies that were operating and designed actually to provide a similar data from the ocean floor a change in the water pressure in the water column\nBut those do is actually had been vandalized\nAnd we're not functioning and as a matter of fact the Marines survey agency BP tea they managed to movies actually cancelled that program\nBecause they were not able to keep them operational so the boys had not been operating since two thousand sixteen\nNow what are the advantages of the system that you helped to develop over this now defunct system of bullies\nThe major difference is it is anchored to the ocean floor so it cannot be vandalized and it uses a very interesting scientific phenomenon\nOf the ceremony kind of warm equatorial waters to enable who's the communication that is underwater communication where the data is transmitted from the sensors to another communication center\nTo another communication sensor and then picked up and transmitted via cable to land station that transmits the data via satellite\nAnd of course the coast of communication in the water is what the whales Jews huh exactly that's exactly right to what extent has perspective now the Indonesian government changed given this recent disaster\nWell I Hope that his change right now I'm certain that\nThey're full attention is on the immediate recovery but you know I Do hope that the agencies will
