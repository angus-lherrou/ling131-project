[noise]\n[noise] no I I don't think so so a governor Rick Scott is the Republican Senate candidate this year was he bearing the brunt of the blame over these red tide bloom\nYeah this is a is a rough time for Governor Scott or as he is now becoming known on on social media they're calling him red tide Rick\nI mean look I think it's partly because he is he's sitting in the chair right he's been governor for eight years and suddenly there's an ecological meltdown happening on his watch he's also he's a Tea Party Republican and he's described himself as the jobs jobs jobs as governor\nAnd part of his push for promoting Florida's economy has been dismantling some of its environmental regulations and particularly regulations that have to do with nutrients and he actually signed a law repealing inspections of septic tanks that have been sending some of these these nutrients into the waters and he actually\nSpecifically asked the federal government for relief from nutrients standards and\nHe is really gutted some of the environmental agencies that were doing enforcement and regulation of of the nutrients that are in the water so there is a pretty plausible case that keeping nutrients out of the water has not been his top priority\nAnd that pollution right and how it's creating these really serious not just environmental but economic problems\nAnd when you say nutrients we're really talking about things like poop fertilizer excesses so it was such like that\nYeah exactly we're talking about an nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients sounds great because they make things grow right there nutritious unfortunately they also happen to be nutritious for algae and uh that's why you're seeing these super charge blooms on on both coasts\nYou know we talk a lot about small I'm In politics but this is one of the first time I've ever talked about it literally\nHad well I Would say like you you generally when you're a politician you don't want to be a mean and you definitely don't want that seem to involve skunk\n[laughter] so to what extent are the candidates here for Senate addressing or maybe they're not addressing the issue of these booms\nWell it's been a huge issue for senator Nelson who of course is saying that basically this is Rick Scott's pollution that he is directly responsible\nWhen Governor Scott has already put twenty million dollars of his own money into campaign advertisements and he's taking this head on\nAnd are making this kind of circuitous argument that actually this is senator Nelson's Paul's and his argument has to do with Lake Okeechobee in the\nIn the middle of the peninsula which it's known as the kind of liquid heart of Florida and Ninety percent of it this year was covered in toxic algae when the lake gets too high the Army Corps of engineers has to blast that filthy water east and west into the estuaries\nThat have had some really serious toxic algae blooms and Governor Scott has argued that because the Congress has not provided enough money for fixing that died\nThey have had to let the water out at a earlier time than they would've had to otherwise and that therefore that's why it's happening and then senator Nelson who has been in the Congress for too long hasn't done enough to get money to fix that died\nWhile of course most people are sort of saying like well yeah but the water's dirty is not supposed to be dirty and the state is in charge of water quality in a in Florida and every state\nSo how much is is hurting the campaign of Rick Scott\nOh it's definitely not helping one of the problems he's facing is that the brunt of the toxic algal blooms are are largely being felt and really staunch the Republican coastal areas when we're talking about action\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W E s a Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press [noise]\nCancel an event that he was supposed to do there because they were going to be so many protesters he got chased out of a restaurant in Venice oh another staunchly Republican area on the west coast\nAnd over and Stewart on the east coast where you know President Trump got sixty six percent of the vote he hasn't been able to get out of his car because uh they're been so many protesters yelling at him about the glove and the water so this is a real problem for him that's one of the reasons that he's fighting back so hard with his campaign ads\nSo nobody's protesters or the trolls that had been hired by the opposition are these folks in neighborhoods were really upset\nNo people are really bad and you can see there's all kinds of evidence that a lot of people don't like flying in their backyard now do Republicans ended up coming out and and voting for Scott anyway just because he's a Republican or because they liked what he says about taxes or because they don't like Chuck Schumer\nThat's certainly possible but every election in every statewide election in Florida is close Governor Scott won both of his races by one point\nSo this is something where if the slime you know it's just flip a few voters or if it persuaded a few voters to to leave the Rick Scott states blank that could really tell the difference between losing and winning\nSo how have the environmental issues featured in past elections in Florida\nYou know Florida is you know in the last Twenty years Republicans have won the governor's race have dominated the legislature it's obviously a swing state\nBut it's definitely filtered read but it is always tilted green the story I like to tell is that Jeb Bush in Nineteen Ninety four when people were talking about him that he was sort of the Arab parents who his dad\nWho is most likely going to be president someday that was Nineteen Ninety four huge Republican year and jet ran as a right wing conservative he was actually making fun of environmentalists on the campaign trail and he turned out to be one of the only Republicans to lose that you hear\nAnd his brother became the kind of Arab parents four years later one of the first things he did after he lost the election was he joined the Audubon Society he ran and Jeb ran in Nineteen Ninety eight as a green Republican any one of his ... in a landslide\nSo this is something where it's not always the deciding issue but it's an issue where you don't want to be on the wrong side of\nAnd so far in Florida that really has been lacking and that's become a really big issue in the governor's race where you see a Democrat Andrew Gillum who is talking about making it a top priority and in the Senate race where democratic incumbent Bill Nelson\nWho is not anybody's idea of a particularly inspiring or effective leader mobilizing action on climate change but has been at least on the side of doing something and Rick Scott has its and he's trying to make that an issue by\nThe way what about climate change as governor Rick Scott is famous for totally agencies not to use that phrase it if you guys have been horribly slashed by hurricane Michael I'm a game you know down south and Florida pretty tough time last year how does climate figure into this\nKnow I Lived until a couple of years ago in South beach and we'd have sunny days where Biscayne Bay was rising through our storm drains at high tide climate change is with the possible exception of Alaska\nIt's a tangible in Florida as it is anywhere else you know we've got most of our state as long as we're very close to the coast we're a peninsula jutting into the Gulf Stream we're\nRight in hurricane alley these are all incredibly
