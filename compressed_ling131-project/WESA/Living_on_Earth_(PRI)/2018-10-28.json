Stanley studios at the University of Massachusetts Boston this is living on Earth I'm Steve her with a major study published in the journal if the American Medical Association has found what many people have long suspected eating organic food appears to reduce the risk of cancer\nAmong some sixty nine thousand people tracked by French scientist over several years those whose diets contained more organics had about twenty five percent fewer cancers overall with thirty five percent fewer breast cancer as an older women and the more than Seventy percent reduction in lymphoma is\nThis study suggests but does not prove that pesticides and other chemical residues in foods cause cancer but there's no reason to wait for more research when it comes to making food choices advocates say including the president of the environmental working group can cook Ken welcome back to living on earth thanks Davis great to be here\nSo when this study came out it showed strong evidence in support of the long held belief that organic food is better for us how do you feel now that the study is out there\nWell you know I guess I feel as if we should have been doing studies like this a long time ago we really do need to be much more careful about the low levels of carcinogens that we still have in our diet the fact that several cancers here\nDid show or a market decrease to me tells me the organic food is probably targeting the mechanisms that are associated with those cancers and the other thing that's interesting\nWhile they speculated about pesticides there are other chemicals in non organic foods that are not allowed in organic certain chemical dies a certain color rings a certain flavorings that simply are not allowed in organic food manufacture\nThat in addition to pesticides may be another reason why there's lower cancer rates amongst these are mostly women who are eating more organic food\nAnd of course if the product is made from genetically modified organisms it's not allowed to be labeled as organic\nIs true as well and there really are not very many chemicals that are allowed in organic manufactured are packaged food\nCompared to conventional where there are thousands so there are lots of questions raised by this study but to me it goes back to the basic point a cleaner set of ingredients closer to nature fewer additives\nFree to explore read it for the
