{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WESA", "content": "Explicit direction from Congress when it comes to rules that impose costs on American businesses he's quite pro business\nAnd he's quite strict when it comes to interpreting environmental laws against broad protections\nSo what's an important or an outstanding case that Brett Kavanaugh has ruled on regarding the environment from his perch in the circuit court of appeals\nWell he recently ruled that EPA does not have the authority to require a substitute\nChemical that's used in refrigerant and a fire prevention devices that is a very potent greenhouse gas that chemical was adopted because it doesn't deplete the ozone layer so it was one of these non\nOzone depleting chemicals but the problem is that it's a terrible greenhouse gas any PA tried to say well we're not going to substitute a greenhouse gas for an ozone depleted let's find a different chemical\nCabin all looked at the language of the clean Air Act and said no it's it's limited ... Doherty is limited to substituting one ozone deplete or for another but it can't take climate change into account\nUh when it looks at alternatives that's kind of a convoluted case but that's an example of a very strict approach\nTo interpreting the law the net result of which is that they're a very virulent greenhouse gas is now on the market that was supposed to be a remedy for ozone depletion but now it's going to cause climate change\nAnd what does this do to the balance of the high court and interview\nWhile it solidifies the conservative wing of what the Gorsuch and cabinet appointments it's now clear that on any of these really close statutory\nQuestions constitutional questions the balance of the power on the court\nWhich we've seen a number of times the Massachusetts versus CPA case ruling that greenhouse gases\nOr a pollutant under the clean Air Act was a five to four decision there been any number of really important five four decisions involving environmental laws and now that conservative wing that strict\nApproach weighing is is in control solidly in control for at least a generation\nSo which environment related cases are coming to the high court in the near future and how do you expect justice Kevin up to vote to rule on those cases\nThey have a very important clean water act case pending it's out of Hawaii\nAnd it involves the underground injection of sewage which then gets right into the ocean waters\nAnd the question is whether or not when you inject the waste into groundwater which then goes into the surface water does that require a permit the Ninth Circuit said yes the county of Maui in Hawaii has a a asked the Supreme Court to review it\nIt will probably come up in the next what they call a conference of the justices coming up very soon and now that Kavanaugh's stairs you'll have a chance to vote to review it it's exactly the kind of case\nWhere the question is gonna be how broadly do you interpret the reach of the clean Water Act you interpret it narrowly to mean there has to be a direct discharge\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... NPR News the sound of a free friends\nOf the justices coming up very soon and now that Kavanaugh's stairs you'll have a chance to vote to review it it's exactly\nThe kind of case where\nThe question is gonna be how broadly drew you interpret the reach of the clean Water Act you interpret it narrowly to mean there has to be a direct\nDischarge the pollutant to the surface water or can it also include an indirect discharge via groundwater so it's it's a classic case where you can expect Kavanaugh to rule against a broad interpretation of the clean Water Act\nUm what does the confirmation of justice Brett Kavanaugh I mean in terms of the United states dealing with the threat of climate change global warming and the years that\nOh I think we have to be realistic if we're going to make any progress on climate change in the United states is going to have to come through the legislative process and that of course means a change in the makeup of Congress both the house and the Senate\nUnder the current majority there really is no realistic hope I don't believe of meaningful action on climate change it it's going to take a major change in electoral politics in the United states we may begin to see some of that and the mid term elections in November frankly I Hope we do\nBut time is short and I don't think we can rely on the courts in the United states right now to deliver the kind of relief we need\nBut what can you tell us about the youth climate law suits against the federal government\nWell the good news on that front is that despite the desperate really efforts of the Trump Administration to stop the trial it is going to start on October twenty nine\nAnd it is going to take several weeks of testimony the plaintiffs in the Giuliani case our children's trust case have come up with a a stellar group of experts scientists economists technology experts so they have a very strong powerful case to present we haven't seen\nWhat the Trump Administration is going to present by way of a case because they'd been desperately trying to run away\nFrom this trial and not show up but I don't think there's any way for them to escape so we're going to see some pretty dramatic\nTestimony in a court of law solidifying the need for immediate action and it's coming at exactly the right time with the elections coming up to twenty twenty elections right around the corner\nI think we're going to see for the first time a really robust\nCross examination tested evidence of of what exactly we need to do and how we can do it the important thing of course is not how bad is the situation but are there are solutions can we actually accomplish the things that we need to do and the answer to that is yes we can\nIf we get busy right away and work as hard as we can we can do it or say many many experts so the trial I think is going to be a show piece of what we can do and must do\nLet's say that um the climate lawsuit against the federal government to prevails at the trial level what chances there that a ruling from the lower court saying that the government has to act would be upheld by the president Supreme Court we have well\nI suppose conventional wisdom would say the odds are against that I think you could probably look at maybe winning and the Ninth Circuit but it's hard to see five votes for some of the theories that the youth plaintiffs are advancing that there's a constitutional right\nTo a sustainable climate the current state of the law is not\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAs opposed conventional wisdom would say the odds are against that I think you could probably look at maybe winning and the Ninth Circuit but it's hard to see five votes for some of the theories that the use plaintiffs are advancing that there's a constitutional right\nTo a sustainable climate the current state of the law is not what we need and not where we need to be and it may well be\nThat this unprecedented threat of climate change will itself change the law is certainly a brown versus board of education moment in our constitutional history maybe the Supreme Court even as curves serve it as it is\nWould be up to that I I suppose you could say it's doubtful that it is but on the other hand nothing ventured nothing gain I think I met the point and a lot of frankly law professors and lawyers are at the point\nOf saying we don't have any other options you know we've got to push this argument as far as we can possibly Porsche and hope for the best\nThat

devastating category for storm as it entered warm waters in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico is yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientists with the inter governmental panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael was only seemingly small increases in the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty Fifteen Paris climate agreement called for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees will be beneficial but this new report finds that half degree difference poses huge risks\nKeeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal was going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer professor Oppenheimer has been a lead author Frye PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back to living on earth Michael\nGo ahead to be here again let me cut to the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the IPC see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and uh if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering\nMessage apart and reading this report\nThe effects of climate change her ready here\nThey are projected to worsen over time the point at which the risks related to climate change that is the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not\nToward the end of the century but very close to a matter of a decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nSo what's the basic premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nReport has an unusual origin the
