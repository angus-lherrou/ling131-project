speed on this issue what are these red and green toxic algae blooms and\nAre they impacting Florida's coastline and the first place\nWell as you mentioned we have two different types of algae blooms one is this kind of neon green guacamole collapse\nThat it's toxic and has been linked to cancer and various testicular problems and then you have these sort of rust colored red tide and that's where you've probably seen on TV the millions of fish are rolling up dead on the white sand beaches of the west coast\nAnd essentially a you know you're talking about microorganisms that as a Rick Scott's administration is always pointing out they are\nNaturally occurring but they feed on nutrients the crud that human beings put into the water and\nThat's what really super charges them and make them bloom and right now we've got a real nutrient problem and that's why you've seen it really you know taking off and destroying the tourist economy on both coasts\nHow important is the health and safety

... diverse in North America are covered with this blanket of\nThanks deep it's good to be with you so why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees Celsius\nAbove pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or we're looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans have warmed up and it's an ocean heat wave and the notion heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the planet\nA hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet and some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into storm surge these days well\nYou know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast has been somewhere between half a foot in the foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting of the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy and twenty twelve at at at a ... foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge might sound like a modest amount a one foot while it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding it meant several\nBillion dollars worth of additional damage on the same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will be storms be particularly that hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quick pop up\nOf the things that we're seeing with warmer in warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we've seen this now so many times where a storm balloons from a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane\nOver the course of a day or two and that only happens over very warm sees and are we getting more\nOf these very intense storm these category you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest in fact there's a relationship for\nA category five storm you get an increase of roughly seven percent in the maximum wind speeds for each\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nCent increase in wind speed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm\nGoes as the third power of the wind speed so it was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential of the storm and that's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures\nYou do the math that means it was probably twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of human caused warming\nYou know the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report is saying that the the world faces perhaps more severe climate impacts of\nGlobal every surface temperatures rise more than one and a half degrees Celsius both the pre industrial temperatures what do we know now about how hurricanes could behave with the world it's more of the one and a half degrees warmer than before the industrial age\nYeah so for each you know half a degree Celsius it's the better part of one degree Fahrenheit\nRight there that's a Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storm\nThat means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius you have a about four percent\nMore moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting uh lots of other weather extremes and global sea level rise and all of these other attributes of climate that we are sensitive to\nIn the past the PC has been the conservative that when the data comes into the projections have been uh been lower than the actual numbers how do you think this report will fare or when the actual data comes in\nYeah so I I've criticized this latest report for once again being overly conservative and its portrayal of the science and and I'll tell you it has to do with a very specific criticism in this case it's the way that they measured the warming that has happened and the ISI the has chosen\nTo measure the overall warming that's taken place\nUsing a baseline that starts in the late Eighteen hundreds and and the reason for that as well that's how far back the thermometer measurements go here's the problem human caused warming began back in the Seventeen hundreds when you know industrialization began so every tenth of a degree Celsius\nOf warming that's happened makes it that much more difficult to stabilize below one point five maybe it's impossible now one point five\nTwo point oh or there's still a clear a path toward stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius but it turns out that if you look at our budget how much carbon do we have left that we can burn and avoid two degrees Celsius if you take in what might sound like a small\nFactor the use of an earlier more appropriate baseline for measuring the warming relative to the pre industrial you have about half as much carbon that you can burn so it was for that specific reason that um that that I criticized uh this report as being overly conservative again\nIt made some choices that in my view understate the amount of warming that's already happened and and us over states the amount of carbon we still have left to burn\nSo let's talk about the carbon budget how many ... tons of carbon as a modern society tossed into the atmosphere on an annual basis and how much more room is there\nSo we are burning right now are about ... thirty ... thirty billion tons of carbon dioxide every year and\nScreaming on W. E. N. site it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt the end news dot edu flash I I I\nToo left in that budget it's all a question now about how quickly do we bring those emissions down here's the good news they sort of flattened a few years ago\nBut flat lining isn't enough we've now got to come down off the other side of the mountain we've got to come down dramatically bring that admissions curved down dramatically if we are going to avoid committing to two degrees Celsius warming if we keep the missions flat at their current level there is no way we get their\n... professor man that means we've got five years to get this right\nYeah if we continue with the current rate for five more years and here's another controversial choice by the ICC PCC um their scenarios the scenarios that they put out for stabilizing warming below one and a half or two degrees Celsius invoke what's known as negative carbon emissions it means we're up over our budget\nSo we now have to take carbon back out of the atmosphere those scenarios allow us to continue to burn carbon now\nUnder the assumption that decades from now we will be able to remove it from the atmosphere it's a faith in unproven technology that I consider foolhardy professor man how scared are you I'm certainly frightened of the possibility\nThat we will not act in time I hold out cautious optimism for the scenario that we do and let me be specific\nDo I hold out much optimism for\nStabilizing warming below one and a half degrees Celsius no I don't at this point do I still see two degrees Celsius stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius as possible I Do but we need to again dramatically reduce our carbon emissions not ten years from now now but\nIt isn't a cliff that we go off of at one point five or two degrees Celsius I'm it's much more like a minefield that we walk out onto into further out onto that minefield\nThe more likely it is that we um set off these devastating destinations and that is why we have to limit the warming as much as we possibly can\nMichael Mann is a distinguished professor of atmospheric science and\nDirector of the earth system science center at Pennsylvania State University thanks so much professor man for taking the time today I think he was my pleasure Steve\nLiving on earth is produced by the world media founded\nOur crew includes Naomi Aaron Burr Bobby basket and Briscoe savannah christiansen Jenny during Jamie Kaiser Don Lyman lives mulloy aims Leo Neal Jake ... go Sarah Rapaport Appalachian and you'll on to Omar Tom tiger engineered our show Alison there is dean composed our theme\nYou could hear as anytime but Louis dot org I tunes and Google Play like these on our Facebook page the our eyes living on her and we tweet from ... living on earth and I'm Steve her with extra listening\nFunding for a living on earth comes from you our listeners and from the University of Massachusetts Boston in association with the school for the environment developing the next generation of environmental leaders and from the Clinton Foundation for the protection of the environment supporting strategic communications and collaboration insulting the world's most pressing environmental problems\nSupport also comes from the energy foundation serving the public interest by helping to build a strong clean energy\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News the sound of a free press\n\nIs the sound of a free press freedom to explore free to challenge free to present the facts Ninety point five W yeah say Pittsburgh's NPR News station", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "20"}
