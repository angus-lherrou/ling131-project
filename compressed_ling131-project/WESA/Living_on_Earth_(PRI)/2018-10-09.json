I was hearing from people\nThat Chinese we're increasingly upset with the quality of their water they're upset with the quality of their air we were posting the daily or quality on the embassy in Beijing\nAnd people were tuning in like crazy to our embassy to find out what the air quality west and the giants they love it but we did it it had an impact\nSo they wanted to take care of their people is that simple they really knew but they did it because politically it's survival they knew it was important to their ability to be able to meet the people's interests which is basically politics we haven't been doing that America\nScreaming on W.
