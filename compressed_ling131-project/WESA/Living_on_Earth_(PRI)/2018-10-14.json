in the country for going on eleven or twelve years he's written three hundred different opinions of which\nProbably for the navy and dealt with either environmental law directly or administrative law issues that relate to environmental laws so he has quite a track record of writing opinions and environmental cases\nSo typically how has justice Kavanaugh ruled on these regulatory cases involving environmental law\nWell he styles himself in the manner of uh the late Justice Scalia who has a textural less a strict construction is and what that means of course is that he looks to the text of a statute when he was asked to interpret it\nAnd if the tax isn't clear enough oftentimes he will rule against and agencies interpretation and an environmental arena that oftentimes means\nThat rules

report\nWhich is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets\nThe report that just came out is on the question of what is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high\nThat we made just as a group of societies not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest I PCC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reach the net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there and I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people and the report they frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has has put on it\nSort of like twelve years of we don't do what we should do the world comes to win and that's not the case reality is at every step you do the best you can if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to win and costs that is the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually\nThat doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands states by they'll make life just miserable extensive\nAnd uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of limiting warming to a degree and a half centigrade\nContrary to what most people think ah the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological the costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible but\nThe real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organized to actually reinvent themselves to be not independent of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what impact do we need to do than as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nThe most general level what we need to do is abandoning using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means\nGetting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible reducing and eventually eliminating our dependence on\nPetroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and probably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere\nFree ... freedom for the the Ninety five ... yet they it's for NPR News station

primarily for transportation and\nProbably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere\nThat even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards the ... century\nIt seems we go in and need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was called for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of\nScientists were skeptical that there would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half two degrees but because the government's call for the report a lot of scientists went out\nAnd started doing a research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees
