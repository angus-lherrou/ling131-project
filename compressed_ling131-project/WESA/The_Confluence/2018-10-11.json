P. M. C. and you can see what the thunder of Carnegie science center actually had their name on the first sports works exhibit\nThat opened in two thousand one and it was through that process that I first met Ron I was ... and he was at the science center\nScreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt the end news dot edu flash I I I\nMy career in marketing and communications at U. P. M. C. and UPN see was a funder of Carnegie science center actually had their name on the first sports works exhibit that opened in two thousand one and it was through that process that I first met Ron I was still at U. P. M. C. and he was at the science center\nWhen I later left UPN see\nI still had this love for the science that are kind of fell in love with it I'm back there before ... two thousand six cents so as I when I joined as the director of marketing I we began to work together as colleagues on the senior leadership team\nOkay so now as the senior leaders as co directors or do you take a while to sort of build up a trust because you're coming from different backgrounds different approaches\nWell we we had worked together as piers ... I was largely on the education side and was on the marketing side so we sat at the same senior leadership table for a for a number of years before we started to work together as co directors\nI think we knew that we were very complimentary and our skill sets and what we brought to uh to to the planning and the leadership\nAnd it actually didn't take very long ah we were going to give it a try and we're going to see how it works and a lot of people were telling us you know there's never works I Know that photo record will never work uh we heard that uh but it never really became a challenge for us it actually became very smooth very quickly\nWe began the ah the prior directors that what you're going to want to do is draw a line and say animal do these things run you'll do these things\nAnd we learned in about the first two weeks that that doesn't really fly uh we both needed to have our hands and just about everything and and that's the way we have approached it over these ten years\nAll right and you can curb you're going to disagree with your partner and I absolutely\nConcur and what we realized early on as as Ron said within the first two weeks I was thinking it took about a week and a half\nBut um we knew that we had to communicate fully um there was no such thing as playing games and holding things back we we knew that we needed to um to let each other know all of our communications that occurred and we also knew that we needed to present a unified front to the rest of the staff we didn't want staff to feel that\nThey could ask one question and get it yes and the other question and get a no um we we decided that we would we would stick together on all of this decisions okay so what's the joint retirement plan as well\nAnd if so what is it because you have some major projects that had you know come to fruition whether it was a very successful capital campaign or the completion of PG or science petroleum\nIt was planned we uh we had this conversation and really it started a couple of years ago when we when we started the project on the horizon horizon and we said you know let's think about what our benchmarks will be\nFor when we exit the organization and we knew that there were things we needed to accomplish we needed to raise all the funds to build our new expansion we needed to open that expansion and run it for a few months and get things up and running and also begin to nurture the next generation of leadership at the science center before we'd be ready to depart but we're approximately the same age\nAnd so we ... we would be ready to retire at about the same time and we just pick the date early on but didn't tell anybody\nSo whether it was during your leadership or while you were the first few years as a director of marketing and run your three decades of experience I wouldn't know did the mission the goal of the sign\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nAnd we just pick the date early on but didn't tell anybody [laughter] [laughter]\nSo whether it was during your leadership or while you were the\nFirst few years as a director of marketing and Ron your three decades of experience I wouldn't know did the mission the goal of the science center change to broaden\nYou know what it's really interesting because when bill planetarium open in Nineteen thirty nine they were the fifth planetarium in the United states you know and the others were all named planetarium if he has a planetarium the Hayden Planetarium I'm\nThe team that forms the planetarium in Pittsburgh ... made the name you'll planetarium but they added Institute of popular science they always had this vision of wanting to be a place where current relevant popular science topics would be accessible to our visitors\nSo that goes all the way back and so as they became a science center it was really trying to live into\nThat same vision to broaden science and so it has broad and quite a lot over the years uh one of the beautiful things about science center is we we don't really draw the line about what we can and can't do related to science we couldn't talk about anything that's relevant and meaningful and uh is of interest to our visitor and so we do\nHear scientists drew lines would be in a lot of trouble I mean that's that's\nTrue it it's really true and we we fraud and our topics on when you when you talk about how we evolved I think with this new expansion we've come to think of ourselves not just as a place for kids and families to come and have a wonderful a visit\nBut also for people of all ages to learn about science and then our extensive educational outreach reaches many many people who don't actually visit to center city I'm Wondering if\nThey get into that so the mission the goals but the role within the community of the science center\nA ... you know always a fascinating cultural attraction to bring people in business and you alluded to more and more about education and educational\nPartner yes well we see about five hundred thousand people onsite at the science center each year we are the number one does it add museum and the pitch in Pittsburgh region\nBut we also see an additional almost two hundred thousand kids each year in educational outreach programs in schools throughout the entire region and we go actually we've gone across the country but the the main places we are a western Pennsylvania and down into West Virginia\nSo we take a simply programs we have microscope workshops wave classroom programs all kinds of activities to interest kids than excite them about science\nAbout the the excitement the mystery of science or I you're making science fun Ron\nAbsolutely I mean that has been the goal uh always and you know as we work with young people especially I'm too often we find young people\nAre kind of turn off the science and math or early on in fact research tells us run fourth grade so we work with early learners I mean we have we have it early learning classroom for the Pittsburgh public schools on site at the science center a it's a great classroom imagine having the science center as your classroom every day\nAnd that's what this class has and uh that's because we want to continue to nurture that interest and the fun and the enjoyment of science and exploration and discovery and curiosity\nWith this ah this this next generation that's coming up\nHow how do you view that evolution and the important growing role as an educator as of education partner if you ... and the need for it\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ...
