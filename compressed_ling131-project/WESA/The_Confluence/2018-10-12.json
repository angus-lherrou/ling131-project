to nine five five were on line at W. say God asked him\nIf the confluence or the news comes together on Ninety four and five W we essay I'm Kevin gap in\nThe city of Pittsburgh as some old streets many of them narrow to help residents safely navigate the city the department of mobility and infrastructure was created I'm not not even two years ago joining us in Studio ... is the director of that department career Rick welcome to the confluence thank you glad to be here\nAll right so how do you make the streets safer for all users when you have cars do have mass transit buses you have a ton of vehicles you have both cyclists and don't forget the ... on those streets how'd you do with all those different folks and vehicles\nAre what part of it is to really I acknowledge that we are sharing the streets with each other and that we do need to raise awareness a of the travelers that are on the street we need to make sure that we're sort of embracing everyone in our community I Know that everyone has an a big hurry to get where they are going and\nUh sometimes really just focusing on their own travel means but um we do need to uh teach people to share those share the road\nAnd we do that by making the streets more predictable more legible if you will so creating\nUm crosswalk that are easy to see that are high visibility that are easy to navigate by creating a bicycle lanes bicycle facilities that give bicycle users they lower stress place to travel\nUm someplace that drivers can anticipate generally the movements that they're going to make by by highlighting our transit stops on the bus stops making sure that vehicles remain clear of those places so that the buses can get to the corners\nAnd unable every one to two board and to move around so really looking at the street so that they are designed in a way that it's intuitive that it's understandable that encourages the kind of behavior that we want to see from our travelers\nSo would signage be a help I mean far in advance of you mentioned that crosswalk if you would maybe a sign whatever would be appropriate fifty a hundred yards of further ahead of that saying basically saying cross walk ahead so that you just don't see it when you come upon it\nSo it is funny thing about science more of them that you have um the less visible they actually become they became a sort of that background noise\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOf you mentioned that crosswalk if you would maybe a sign whatever would be appropriate fifty a hundred yards of further ahead of that saying basically saying cross walk ahead so that you you just don't see it when you come upon it so it was a funny thing\nAbout science more of them that you have um the less visible they actually become they become sort of that background noise of the street I'm so we do try and be a little bit more judicious about where we're putting signage out\nUm so that people are really drawing their attention to that when we need them to but other than that we really want to design streets that we call a having felt and forcing the designer self regulating design where the street itself\nUm the place that we place the lines that the curb lines um the the the angle of the street and that that is more instructive to the travelers than relying on an signage at the curb side of the road\nHim oh what am I W E s a college spoke with you at the end of last year December of Seventeen and he said one of your priorities for twenty Eighteen was to improve street design make Pittsburgh are safe place to live work and walk\nAnd you use the term vision or excuse me versions zero [noise] what did you mean by that and have you made progress toward those goals that you outlawing do nothing about ten months or so ago\nSo vision zero as the ... school um that really is a existing across many countries of the world which is the notion that we really can eliminate fully ... and ... severe injuries on our city streets and the travelers have the streets\nUm we have not quite reached that goal a vision zero I'm yet nor did we anticipate that we would in ten months but um we are making great progress in slowing travel speeds down we do know that the the speed of travel when it crashed occurs um relates very strongly to the severity\nOf that crash and the likelihood of a fatality or serious injury coming out of it so just bringing travel speed style and we've initiated neighborhood traffic calming program I'm working with many neighborhoods across the city to um put in place interventions that will help manage travel speeds and will help us behave better\nOr as neighbors to one another and really move forward we've made different and improvements an intersection as that you can see in Oakland and squirrel hill and and my Washington and other places of the city\nUm that improve the crosswalk improve the shortened the crossing distance improve the visibility of pedestrians all of these are in service to this notion of a vision of zero traffic fatalities\nThose costs Walker improvements they part of the ... redesigned the design of some of the streets and how do you uh the second part of the question is how do you do that as I mentioned you know we're in old city we have old street so how can you accomplish\nThe redesigning and still make them a beneficial to all users\nSo old streets are are a major assets to oh okay so many of the newer cities if you travel to the west coast or the other\nUm newer cities in the U.S you'll see big broad streets designed for speed really oriented around automobile travel that is not the way that Pittsburgh streets were were designed Pittsburgh streets were designed around walking and horse drawn carriage as street cars\nAnd that is really one of the strengths that we have is really embracing the history that we have restoring the history um we do have narrow streets and that does introduced um some conflicts between ... and vehicles but it also maintains lower travel speeds shorter\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nWere designed around walking and horse drawn carriage as an street cars\nUm and that is really one of the strengths that we have is really embracing the history that we have restoring history um we do have narrow streets and that does introduced\nUm some conflicts between ... and vehicles but it also maintains lower travel speeds shorter crossings we are putting in a more cross walks I'm sure you've seen all across the city higher visibility cross walks\nUm and and we're doing more paving than we've done ever before so improving the quality of the streets\nA Ernie Pyle describes a city in an old Pittsburgh Press article as being designed bought a bunch of hungry really goes uh would you say\nWell I I've heard it described by by any number of people uh uh\nAs being a very confusing downtown as a having um just some really contorted configurations of our street frankly I think we could use more belly goats and they don't manage some of the vines and and an invasive species that we had a growing around our hillsides but\nUm no it's it's a great street it really is a city that\nUh we have meandering streets where you really almost are forced to enjoy the place that you're in you're surprised as you come around corners to see remarkable vistas to see wonderful kinds of new discoveries in our city\nUm it is not a city of rigid grids like Chicago or or some of the other plane a city but we are a city of a very a circuitous streets but that's part of the charm and the interest that we have here\nWhere you were you were talking about the some of the younger cities and the roads and streets that were designed for motorized traffic yeah that can be an all this task looking across six or eight lanes I've got a ...\nRight yeah I mean some sometimes I I did come from Washington DC I think as we've mentioned and and I go back often and I\nThink while on occasion it would be nice to have a slightly larger streets because we can do a little bit more a broader sidewalks better bike facilities um dedicated transit lanes I'm but I'm very glad that we do have um the narrow streets that we do have a as part of the charm of the city\nI Want to talk more about about your plans were yarn certain stages and the future a book how have your plans in general been impacted by the year of the landslide spurts and elsewhere but within the city of course\nUm well I can say unequivocal a that was unplanned um we really didn't anticipate having more than two dozen landslides that we would need to respond to in the single year\nI'm In addition to the landslides we had over six major flooding uh events and those continue to occur particularly along uh sawmill Ron industry trying on some of our other um waterways we also had the train derailment um which was which was an interesting encounter so it did a\nThrow us off our game a little bit to a need to uh uh address all of those events that we had I Will say I'm very very proud of the team that we have here across many departments\nAre in the city who really came together responded to these on anticipated events in a very quick way by and large we kept the city face and kept the city operating um through all of these are still work to do is we address those those a slight events now but\nUm they were a significant disruption in our plans for for other investments but we were able I think to um respond to these uh major events and sort of keep rolling if you will on some of the other ...\nDreaming on W.

I'm Sorry forty percent of those are trips of less than a mile sixty percent of those mile long trips are driven and an automobile", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Confluence", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "12"}
