catastrophes from global warming and we have to do it more quickly\nThose who doubt the idea of cutting emissions that much might point to engineering solutions things like carbon capture to take carbon pollution out of the air and story instead\nBut is new technology on its own a real stakes Scott Waldman reports on climate change for any news he says it's important to remember tech got us here in the first place\nThe two biggest sources of pollution in this country our power plants and vehicles so\nWe're looking at both of those and we have technology to bring down the admissions for both of those but they're still tremendous potential and they're still you know demand in the marketplace\nWe've also seen a tremendous increase in solar power people putting panels on their houses and the last decade and there's far more potential there um but it's not going to happen without some sort of government a subsidy I think to shift the marketplace even more strongly\nWhat role does the government has any kind of sparking this kind of advancements\nGovernment has a tremendous role here and if you look at\nYou know some of the earlier or places where government invested in our infrastructure um or even where it's doing it now you can see how important that is so if you look at the electrification of rural areas a century ago and that\nReally created the market place for the government had to be the one that actually paid for the lines to be strong all around the country I'm for that marketplace to exist\nSo there's plenty of areas where the government could subsidize the actual infrastructure that would help us address climate change\nAnd then there's also just simply going back to research and development the battery storage that we need to be able to use to store the power created by solar panels in wind turbines\nDoesn't exist at the level we needed to right now so that there's tremendous areas where you see the potential but the matter of whether or not the political will is there is is an entirely different question\nWhen talking about the tax to capture carbon and store it there is fears that too much stock is put into that kind of technology\nRight yes exactly I think uh people are worried that\nThe concern about focusing on carbon capture technology for instance is that it could then spur a wave of\nYeah absolutely so every one of our ah programs are really customize will I mean we really try to fit the need of the community the group the university I'm across the board a lot of the bar centered under trained to do our on universities and sometimes with schools as well\nBut so this time it was really sort of interesting for us 'cause [noise] I Know myself included haven't had the opportunity to really\nDo any work in sort of a larger community aspect so I thought it was really important to tailor it because I mean have they have different needs there's um and in many ways it's it is vulnerable space not everybody knows everybody in the in the in the room so we want to make sure that we ... so that everybody in their God somebody out of it\nAnd really started the conversation\nLike around how do we even think about stepping in or saying something or respond to you as an actor virus was occurring\nA few hundred people signed up as interested on their Facebook page advertising that training how many people ultimately came and what was the reaction that you had in the room [noise] uh we had\nAbout sixty people actually show up which was really great um and it was sort of a good mix of both residents and visitors and visitors of the neighborhood um and I think everyone was just really happy to be in a space where we could talk about this openly safely and productively\nThe early ... the piece were overwhelmingly female that many men attend\nAh there were men in the in the room a and actually a lot of them and they came came with their partner or in some cases with like a mom even um which is interesting we saw a lot of people come in kind of as a family unit and addressing this together I mean at the table that I Would that for instance\nUm there was a whole family there that was kind of engaging in this conversation together which you know was was really interesting and and and pretty meaningful I think\nWhy is it important to have something approaching gender parity in something like a group bystander intervention training\nOh I think it's critical that there's um that there has to be representation from all genders all people um the reality is um let me sexual violence happens to everybody from you\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd and also too I mean if men aren't involved then\nLike it's not gonna it's not gonna grow people aren't going to be able to feel like they can stop and if it just sits in like in some sort I think for a while people talked about it as a women's issue which is not real I mean it's a community issue it's a it's a it's a it's a people issue\nAnd I think men are involved in that we don't start stepping up and I'm getting involved in having conversations are real that um that it's just the prevention isn't going to grow and so it makes sense\nAnd it's important for for a meant to be aware of of what women deal with on a daily basis I think that was um one of the things that I saw in the room was uh for for men who live in the neighborhood they very different experience\nUm to hear that you know women experience cat calling on a daily basis in the neighborhood\nThat's pretty that was ... opening I think for some folks and and you know understanding that your experience as a man or in the neighborhood can be radically different from what I'm other identities experiencing I'm walking down the street I\nThink it's important to with um mail but as far as you know a lot of them will come to me in and say like my space and seen is safe to some people you know what can I Do to fix that and personally their spaces in Pittsburgh that I like can't or won't go to for those reasons I think it's really good that a lot of our business owners to sort of making an effort to try and make their spaces as safe as possible for everyone also\nIn terms of designing a training and creating a safe ... how do you add create a conversation that doesn't put too much of the mental load on women and to share their experiences in a way that men can understand what's going on\nYeah so um we spend a lot of time before a training speaking about space right how we could have safe space where people um the reality is these trainings aren't really set up\nTo and I think we we make a point to make sure that we not only have advocates in the room that if something does occur somebody needs if they disclose or they're filling triggered of overwhelmed they can step out and have like a talk with somebody want to want to make sure services there um we try to incorporate um\nSome [noise] in in perfect perfect or we try to incorporate some breaks in their own people to kind of have that but also um oddly enough I feel like\nThe the the the way that we try to ... or the way we try to structure it so that everybody has a voice there and they feel like I feel like the load isn't always on women there and maybe it's just natural like I mean it might be a man a man thing but I feel like men want to talk\nAnd I think they want to help and I think they want to jump in and and um and\nAnd be part of it so I think we really try to make sure that people aren't in a space that's unsafe and it all the way doesn't come on them to share their experiences\nUm a lot of what we do is we we have an air base the way we take it out of that we were really to ruin out there to hear their experiences obviously come up and obviously we deal with that when it happens but I'm In space we tried to make it safe by making sure that they\nHave sort of the removed from somebody that I made very experiences\nAnd I think part did a really good job of having counselors on hand during the training a separate room that folks can go to if the again if they\nIf they started to get too emotional or they take a break a and then they were extremely intentional along with our co facilitator Heather manning and really setting up some community agreements at the at the start of it so we could kind of ground some of that conversation and and with some expectations\nUm and really making sure that we're thinking about the intersection too of um of of sexual violence and other forms of harassment\nAnd the reality is I mean it's a I mean it can be a heavy heavy room and I think it was a heavy room at times but\nFree to
