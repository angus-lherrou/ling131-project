community\nMention Keystone crossroads\nAnd joining us now is Keystone crossroads reporter Emily ... who spearheaded this project on the public defense system in Pennsylvania and thanks for joining us Emily thought to be here come in and we will get to the basics what really got you interested in this whole subject matter\nSo we were surprised to learn that Pennsylvania is the only state that doesn't provide at least some state funding for its public defender system um the majority I think about thirty states either exclusively or mainly\nFund their public defense systems and the rest kick in at least something\nAnd all this despite the fact that seven years ago when there were still more states not funding or overseeing their indigent defense systems there was a legislative report that came out that pointed to how much is unknown and pointed out that there was no real guidance for things like\nThe attorney caseloads requirements or a qualification guidelines for people who were hoping to\nGet the services of public defender's office so we took a look at that report realized nothing had been done since then and decided to try to take a closer look\nYou also reported that data is difficult to find them they'd be piecemeal at this how did you go about the collecting what UVA\nIt was basic budget data but of course that's\nKept differently in every county it's not really reported anywhere in one file or anything like that I mean the ... the the department of community and economic development does collect\nSome county budget data but it doesn't break it down by department which is obviously what we would have needed to know to look at how the system is funded currently\nAnd so it really was first going online looking to see what we could get from budgets and audits and things like that that were on line and we've got some information that way but most of it was\nWas not accessible just by going to count as websites would fall right to know requests and then those would come back wouldn't have it we were looking for\nSo we'd say okay you know it wasn't on your payroll records so maybe it was an you're meeting minutes or something along those lines and we did this for both the da and the public defenders offices\nTwo thousand date and to thousands of teen in every county we were looking for each departments total budget their expenses in revenues they're stopping level so that's full in part time attorneys or support staff\nAnd we were also looking for salaries so chief public defender or the district attorney him or herself on down

herself on down to a starting salary for an assistant district attorney assistant public defender\nParity and salaries between assistance on in those two offices as a more straightforward way to assess in combination with other metrics whether county is making a good faith effort to try to provide an adequate\nUm defense for people who cannot afford an attorney within you know the scope of dot counties resources\nOften when a reporting project such as this is a negotiated there's obviously to inform the public but also maybe shine a light do you expect to any change in the data collection process as a result of your reporting or other efforts\nNow you live in Pennsylvania you know how quickly the legislature moves how response of they are and this is just an issue that doesn't seem to inspire any action on the part of our legislature\nI think that you know you are seeing more bipartisan support for criminal justice reform bills about other issues like mandatory life without parole sentences\nAnd they're getting more backing from conservatives are than they did in the past and typically that was more of something that was like a liberal issue um but they are getting bipartisan support to a greater degree than they\nHave in the past I'm In one example of an issue that I think could have direct bearing on Pennsylvania and other states public defense systems is Dale reform\nThat seems to be picking up a lot of steam nationally\nAnd if representation of bail hearing becomes a requirement imposed externally Pennsylvania will have no choice but to overhaul and increased funding for public defense system even if the data isn't there to back that up\nYou mentioned uh the um the bell was used in other states and addressing the affordability of bail argue models used by other states Pennsylvania might consider adopting regarding the uh the funding of a public defense system\nIt really does run the gamut as far as how much oversight how much funding other states provide or if it's simply a state level system on the American bar association has consulted on caseload studies and I think for other states at this point their goal is to do twelve\nAnd then do a study of those twelve collectively to come up with caseload recommendations and I'm bringing up caseloads because that's a very much tied into\nFunding and overstay 'cause that's what this all comes down to write the public defenders perhaps not having enough resources to provide an adequate to science so\nThey've only done those studies in states that have a more centralized court system not a decentralized court system Pennsylvania has however when I talked to the states former consultants who have worked in other states are criminal justice issues on a cutting costs or prisons improving operations\nThey said that Pennsylvania actually does have a pretty good set up shockingly as far as data collection compared to other states with decentralized court systems versus you know statewide state run\nUm Texas could be a model because they also have a decentralized court system and have relatively recently made some reforms and strides related to indigent defense\nNew
