Meyer Daniel welcome more to Kevin [noise] All right so the orchestra is a half century old [noise] so what need was there for a symphony in this community when it started I Know you haven't been around that long you\nKnow it's interesting because a lot of these orchestras started off as to some degree a community orchestra and an orchestra of people that loved to play music maybe had some will definitely have some form of music training and may have even had a a an undergraduate or graduate degree in music\nBut pursued other careers or how to their lives and wanted to get together and perform symphonic music having Westmoreland something is is one of those\nYeah yeah and it um it from a very earnestly because I'm a lot of folks in the community felt that there was such a void because at the time Pittsburgh's company\nWas doing regional concerts all around the area and um you know but they would come you know say in January and come back in December whatever have you and uh but they felt that the void in between that they thought you know this is something we really need for our community\nUm that we need to have to have this asset uh and that's that's basically the\nThe gist of how we we were birthed if you will\nPrint some sort of sort of small in terms of the number of performances but then it just continue to grow because of the demand\nWell that's true and then it also morphed into a fully professional orchestra some now everyone on the stage as as as paid a wage and I'm with the expectation is that everyone on stage will have taken a competitive audition in order to gain entry into the orchestra so we\nWe roughly have three or four openings every year because we have musicians ... coming in and out of the Pittsburgh region\nAnd uh when we have an opening we do it all call and we have a competitive auditions and people come in and sometimes we have as many as sixteen to twenty five candidates for one one spot Westmoreland symphony\nYeah and the nice thing is that that you know the these are people who are very well you know extremely talented in what they do I mean we're not you know we're really getting people um the whole way uh you know people who are really really high tears what I'm trying to say I mean so were you know it's really really great\n[noise] there are a lot of folks through the years who has spent long periods of time working for and with the orchestra crystal Horner\nA cofounder of the orchestra and let it as I Believe exec you director ... one of your predecessors twenty five years if I keep roast mark who served as a conductor for thirty one years that's amazing so what is it about this orchestra that people won't once they get there they want to stay\nWell from my perspective the musicians loved playing with each other yeah they love taking the stage at and playing this incredible repertoire\nBecause um you know many of our musicians are freelance musicians in the Pittsburgh region and they play in the ballet pit they play for the opera is they play a lot of different musical ensembles around western Pennsylvania\nAnd some of them even spillover into some of the other groups I work with like the ...\nOf the blue ... stern in Cleveland or they might play the Akron symphony the wheeling symphony but often they are playing ballet scores or something like that so when they get a chance to place the Bailey a seventh symphony yeah they're really excited and it's a it's a real attraction for some of those musicians to together to to play that that specific repertoire\nYeah I think it's really a testament to I'm just the the camaraderie you know I think in the community spirit that although we you know we have moved into a regional orchestra\nUm is very much you know ... we are here people come to the orchestra because they know they're going to get quality music and the other musicians are at the highest caliber but they want to be there just as much as the audience wants to be there
