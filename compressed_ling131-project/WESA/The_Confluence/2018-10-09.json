and responsible way to include our resident\nYou have banded together in various stages but one of the first really public moments that people became aware of your working together and collaborating\nI had to do with a letter that you wrote are urging state attorney General Joe Shapiro to take up the case against these Pittsburgh Police officer Michael Rumsfeld after the shooting\nThe death of a teenager Antwon Rose tell us how you came together on that particular issue and what did you want to convey\nOh if I may because actually the week before we banded together to write a letter um about the illegal detention and separation of families of immigrant oh okay so that you know there's obviously been so much happening our society so that letter first came\nAnd then after a while I'm with the initial hurt the devastation with the murder of Antwon Rose I reached out to my fellow millennial mayors and said hey can we band together for this this is heavy on my heart especially in a community like Wilkins bird\nAnd they were very receptive and you know I'll let you guys take it from here but\nAnd I mean really I were in charge of our police departments this is something that's so important to us to make sure that we have our police departments that are focused on the best for our community is the best for all people in our communities and that we're focused on making sure that they're anti racism and they're\nDoing what's best for everyone ...\nWe've been given a platform and we have a duty to use that platform to affect good and change in our communities I think the three of us have done an excellent job of engaging residents and visitors on Facebook on Twitter and on social media\nAnd as I said with that platform we can project that message and in particular in sharp spurred our we have time standing general orders and the first two orders there or community oriented policing and I took that to heart because the best way to prevent crime is to stop it before it even happens\nRight so let's follow up a little bit on that police accountability is an overarching issue and even the quality of the police forces how well

came from the city of Pittsburgh ... exactly\nExactly so you know first of all more than fortunate to have her on board so it's been great to work with her to amplify some of those initiatives we've already had that when people come out of academy offers has come out of academy\nAs the bare minimum for training we have where they have to do at least Fifteen additional hours in training so it's an investment\nIn our part on what uh our our police chief in Belleville Matt sat in our he's he's done a great job of making sure that our officers have an exceptional amount of additional training and have opportunities open to them whenever one may arise to further their education\nFor me it's been creating an open line of communication with my police chief on a regular basis if something happens that maybe I don't understand or I feel should have happened in a different manner\nWe just start that conversation so that maybe I can understand better or maybe he can understand my point of view are better at so really for me it it's been that communication with not just the cheap but also the officers that allowed us to write best\n... how do you make sure your officers are accountable shore I come from a unique background when it comes to the police department my father served as a police officer and trucks for for forty one years and he served as the police chief for twelve of those years until his retirement\nAnd our current chief Tom ... I've known Tom my entire life he's been with the force for Thirty years I'm thirty two years old and promised on a great job since taking over\nUh we've invested a lot of our police department over the last couple of years we bought for new cruisers all new radios on your side arms or we instituted the canine in that department we have a handler and a canine our officers are also getting trained\nA and they're taking specific duties so for example we have an officer who works with a youth and the community and we sent him to training once a month we have an officer that's now specializing in the special response in with a north hills\nI we've officers that focus on traffic duties and with that investment we're\nSeeing the department grow and without growth are also engaging the community more again like I said community oriented policing is number one on my plate and if kids are playing ball or from football or the officers are going to get out of their trucks and\nMean shoot hoops or play ball or they're going to walk to knock on doors and check on residents are checking the business district\nOr at the start of this conversation I ask you about what was the was there an issue that sort of prompted you to run for mayor\nI'm going to turn that I wanted Vance that now so you're each now months or more into your tenure what one goal now is most important in each of your communities and we want to start with you this time\nOh my goodness um it's been so multifaceted really in the beginning it was about taking on as much as I could and seeing what we needed to do\nA at this point going back to public safety um my biggest goal is making sure\nThat we're we're being as effective as possible and right now I'm taking an initiative on with our volunteer police fire department excuse me we have a bit of a unique situation we ... do happen next department we have three paid\nFried ... free to pursue the truth\nNinety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAt this point in going back to public safety um my biggest goal is making sure\nThat we're we're being as effective as possible and right now I'm taking an initiative on with our volunteer police fire department excuse me with a bit of a unique situation we ... do happen next department we have three paid firefighters\nAnd the rest volunteered so that's that's my big effort right now is to create a structure that we can operate under that where the safest we can be\nAre worried a top of your list right now go\nRight on top of my list is really looking at crime prevention initiated a one of the things that Matt had touched on as being proactive and preventing crime so we have restarted with the police department and myself we started our public safety forums that will happen on a monthly basis\nAdditionally we spoke with police chiefs of Penn hills\nEdge wood forest hills was failing Churchill to really discuss\nThis surge of the crime and shootings that we're seeing in our region\nThe connecting thing and that is that a lot of these actors and the victims are teenagers so now we're really looking at getting into the root of the problem in addressing gun violence as a public health epidemic", "show_name": "The Confluence", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "09"}
