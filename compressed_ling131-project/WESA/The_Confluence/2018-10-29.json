our deepest condolences to you in the community that you can\nTell us what role was tree of life ... eat in your life\nWill treat life uh it is a synagogue that uh I uh why didn't attend and didn't belong to was a place where I did uh go to Hebrew school when I was eleven years old\nUh to train for my bar mitzvah um because at that time uh my a synagogue did not have permits which today that do road show\nBut a ... in a independent of that I've spent many times a a on a Saturday morning\nAt the services a tree of life or at a a friend or family members a bar mitzvah than at weddings a shot spent many many times there I've spoken that some of the\nBrotherhood for a brunch as a over the years so it's a it's a synagogue unfamiliar with literally is five blocks from my home [noise]\nWhat's your reaction response have you been receiving from around the Pittsburgh area and elsewhere\nUh you know an ethic is as many of us are our phones have blown up with Texan emails from friends and family I've heard a from a my colleagues across the state uh both Republicans and done\nDreaming on WGN appointed by emailing university integrated into the detail on a master's program\n... di ... last night I\nOr if a community to heal a it's very reassuring particularly as you look at us as well around the state that the visuals that are taking place in different communities I've had colleagues of mine sent\nA photographs of of of their communities a visuals and ah I think it's really unfortunate that an event like this\nUh you know it is something as a vehicle to bring people together but again it's also reassuring\nOr that the people of diverse community and fabric of Pennsylvania a recognizes that this is a time to support Pittsburgh to support squirrel hill or in our community and to speak out against violence and hatred\nAnd we're we're too well aware that this kind of violence and hatred has manifested itself in too many places across our country but was there a sense of false security or maybe just plain hold then it wouldn't happen here\nWell you know I I I Know our community or try to prepare as best as possible as the United Jewish Federation or has a a a security arm that tries to deal with many institutions I mean we have\nDozens of synagogues a we have you know a agencies that the deal like true family children's service that you associate of aging\nOr other agencies in the community or resources that serve\nThe Jewish community and the broader community and it's always been a concern I think for us that we make sure that if we secure them\nParticularly in this day and age because we've seen an extraordinary uptick in the in the number of anti Semitic acts of fifty seven percent increase in the number of anti Semitic acts across this country in one year [noise]\nUm so so we uh uh ... well we are optimistic and uh you know and feel pretty secure\nA I think we have tried to be prepared as possible and I think we're going to have to redouble our efforts to prepare the community uh and in our institutions to strengthen them in order to be able to be prepared for anything like this that might happen again\nAnd final quick question for years you've been a leader in the Pennsylvania house pushing for stronger protections for all or do you\nThink the tone in Harrisburg is ready for any changes\n[noise] I I I think there there is a sense is maybe there's some something brewing hum you know with respect to a number of things uh you know I've been working on civil rights legislation so that we don't discriminate against\nA community of the ... of folks in our state um and that's important because what happened here today's we had a specific community specific group of people that were targeted that's really disturbing and we saw\nAlgae beauty people are targeted in Florida so ... when these acts of hate that target specific groups take place we need to be able to address it at the at the state level so having an anti discrimination law that is comprehensive uncovers everybody\nHaving a hate crimes bill a law that we we had a we do not have it Pennsylvania there's a federal one that we are one of the few states that does not have the hate crimes bill and then looking or to have reasonable uh controls over uh the ownership of firearms because when you blend\nYou know the level of hatred that we see
