north American free trade agreement and while NAFTA's better known for say blue jeans avocados and cars the United states Mexico Canada agreement as it is known is updated for the digital age\nFor example they would protect Internet companies like Facebook or Google from being sued over material that shows up on their services the way the U.S does now\nIt also addresses how Internet services and future five gee networks might work in all three countries and it would make it easier for digital goods and data to cross borders\nVictoria Aspen is on the White House trade advisory committee and she's the CEO of a trade group called the software alliance I asked her to define this idea of digital trade\nAt essence digital trade is often about data and how data moves around the world\nAnd the reason that this new agreements is really important is because right now even the data is very important to our economy into the global economy there's no international consensus on data and how they should be treated at what the rules are around data\nAnd so it is the first step towards trying to create the international consensus that we clearly need on how data's used and how Davis treated so what's\nIn there let's dive in to that new trade agreement how does it change how data moving across borders and and what are some of the provisions that it makes\nSo I'll give you a couple of examples one of the things that it says is that as a default rule data can move back and forth across borders there some circumstances under which can't but generally speaking that's the default rule and what that means in concrete terms\nIs that if you are providing cloud computing you don't have to build a data center at every country in the world in order to provide cloud computing\nIt also means that countries can't force data to stay within their borders in order for companies should be able to do business there\nAnd that's really important when you're talking about emerging technologies like cloud computing or data analytics or artificial intelligence because they don't work and less data can move across borders fairly easily that's obviously important the software companies but it's really important for the customers with software company over everything\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a

county public defender's office typically ran surpluses of more than four hundred thousand dollars each year from twenty Thirteen to twenty sixteen that bothered ... far more than his caseload\nThe solution was to hire more attorney solution will to hire more investigators we had the ability to do that\nChief public defender Eliot how's he doesn't see a problem he says his office has simply become better managed\nIn terms of resources in terms of our ability to effectively represent our lives wherever we need [noise]\nHere just across the street from the Allegheny county courthouse is devoting more resources than ever before to its clients [noise]\nHe says the office gets clients out of jail before trial three quarters of the time\nAnd that it's getting record numbers of cases dismiss before a trial\nHe sent letters from inmates confirmed the office has improved dramatically\nI first of all my position of the complaints would be that I haven't seen the Tony I don't know what's going on now the the letters are geared more towards information you know what should I expect next you know can you are expert I my my court hearing you know can you please contact the family members things like that\nAudi agrees the office has made strides but he says those improvements aren't sustainable without more attorneys and that current public defenders are being asked to do more for low salaries that aren't keeping pace with inflation\nAnd it creates a situation in which there's high turnover there's\nOften just satisfaction with the work environment and to claim it that's not going to have any bad effect\nOn representation I think it's fanciful\nChief defender how's he acknowledges turnover is a challenge and it says recruitment and retention our priorities he says three to five attorney positions are vacant at any given time but how's he says public defenders today have far fewer cases than they used to\nHe says in twenty eleven and attorney could be assigned more than a hundred fifty cases\nRegardless some say staffing and resources alone can't solve the fundamental issues that came to light in the Nineteen Ninety six lawsuit here it's a big ball check of ACLU\nStick to progress that we had hoped for never materialized but at some point the litigation can't do it all it really requires leadership within the office and when you don't get that you don't get the progress or the reforms that are needed\nAnd ... there was another limitation to the zoo in Allegheny county\n... county by county approach or sixty seven counties in Pennsylvania what we

reporters Winston sea run and Brad ... who joined us from the print newspaper that caucus in Harrisburg Winston Brad welcome good to have you with us morning yeah morning so to Egypt and we'll start with Winston what got you interested in the legislative caucuses\n[noise] so uh for a different story I had interviewed a former Senator Mike fruit Baker who said that he had actually never seen a list of ... says despite asking for one for many years\nUm he said in the eight years he served he had actually thought never been able to get somebody to give him a copy of the list of caucuses and uh so you know we started looking into it we asked\nTo see a list of ... and we're unable to get them\n... ... ... you know what what were some of the challenges that um Winston day just alluded to\nI'm you know getting records of the ... which caucuses exist was was difficult much less you know what they've been spending of it you know spend any tax money or have outside interest groups spent money on their behalf which we found out the answer was yes in both cases to some of these caucuses\nBut just to back up a second you know Winston got intrigued by this because of a brew beggars comment and to be honest with you I didn't think it was particularly good idea a story because at that time because of course we've heard for ... about caucuses for years and years and know that they don't\nActually voted on anything they don't really determine anything are almost more in many cases fraternal or some policy making this you know a um efforts on their part but they're not\nFried ...

actually vote on anything they don't really determine anything they're almost more in many cases fraternal or some policy making this you know a um\nEfforts on their part but they're not\nOfficial they don't get things done and God Knows there's enough\nCommittees that do vote on things to keep track of around here that that they're sort of at the edge of things at least that's the way I thought of it\nAnd I think that's the conventional wisdom around here why why bother with caucuses are so much else because we've had a tag American caucuses and manufacturing caucuses you name it so they haven't been a high on our horizon Winston I had just started with\nThe caucus this year and she worked for Harper's Weekly before and it it it took as my one editor said someone from the outside coming in to look at this\nTo realize what a good story it is because uh it it and she started to peel back layers of it and ask more questions about it\nIt got me interested in ... this this is a really good story and uh that that realization came with the first right to know a request that came back showing they had spent a some tax money in one case where they claim no tax money had been spent that was with the tax payers caucus\nSo um anyway that's the background of it and I'm a Winston can maybe tell you a little bit more what she did from their\nBright and ... to clarify\nI'm there are for political party caucus is the ... the Republican Democrat and of course all the standing committees um so what types are these the bride was mentioning or they social political trading based\nWe we found that there were sort of two different types of a lot of these uh non party caucuses there is the sort of fraternal caucuses that Brad just mentioned um caucuses like the\nUh Italian American ... and a cigar caucus I and the Sears sucker caucus these ah groups that are that meat you know less frequently and are more about camaraderie and\nI'm a member of sort of coming together and and sharing a meal or across the aisle and then there we found that they're actually um you know another very different type of caucus there's the policy oriented caucus ... says these are a sort of\nGroups that even set their own agenda at the end at the beginning of the air they draft legislation they review legislation they're much more organized and um so so between these two they they they look very different these two different types of caucuses\nThey some of them ... almost like booster clubs from high school or their cool Koch issues nerdy ones I no one knew lawmaker or a told you that had gone looking for a master list of ...\nUh when he arrived in Harrisburg were never followed one was that just to have or maybe he was looking for a fun or a productive called to join\nI
