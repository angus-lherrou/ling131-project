just think of\nJust a joy of lights in the context of Ireland ... music ties in with that\nAnd I also remember you grew up in Detroit yes a Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl gets so just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nFrom my father was a singer he came from Tipperary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous\nAnd my mother was a musician at harsh so she always had music on the stereo playing chopping down member vinyl one after the other plop down and also we were members of the gay the league and the Irish American sub in downtown Detroit ...\nAnd that was our community that was where we socialize and so I sang my first son into a lake there when I was seven\nFor my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that session singing sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing song\nAnd people don't know that about Detroit it's uh it's got a very very strong Irish population had a\nBit of Ireland in Detroit absolutely\nAnd then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my grandmother's kitchen and my grandfather's kitchens no television the news came on the radio otherwise it was off everything was generated by us and it was all song and story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like higher\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it's things to something larger disparate\nIt bullied the spirits of the Irish who have left through the centuries have no choice of their own to make a living in other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the heroic people and pride of place every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is the way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive Rhode Island does a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about added\nTo I don't want people to run off the bus

Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell\nYou were subjugated by the the English for centuries you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about

to\nA valid history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most except that it was Thomas Davis who is one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and Conor Lamb and Plunkett\nWhen Ireland was starving during the great hunger Thomas Davis was writing

between Catholics and Protestants knows the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted Ireland to be its own nation but he wrote songs and he believed that the best way to serve the history of the country was through its ballot tree\nAnd I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are extant they still exist were still singing them\nThey keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of the struggle or this this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up in that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about off it's not the culture of celebrity that sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the June\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great song or two and it was there before us and it will be there after us so we're just playing our heart and continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear her street musicians and your music and the\nPubs you actually hear

after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one up\nAnd we traced rocket covers German combed through our times and interviewed I witnesses to come to his own conclusions which he writes about in Savage Harvest a tale of chemicals colonialism and Michael rocker colors tragic quest Carl good to have you back on the show\nThanks so much so did I said that Rockefeller story up correctly there\nYes no question I mean Michael graduated he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and\nWent off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called then a few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were\nIncredible ... and she determined to go to as Matt and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick to sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and are on that trip pie banished\nSo Michael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one and you're studying up this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to the his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nI think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was a young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around our you know the way I'm not\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... NPR News the sound of a free friend\nJust started of of the world he was enamored of ... and fascinated by asthmatic culture and has met carving it means you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were you know twenty three twenty four foot high a poll kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he you know got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd this is in New guinea this is a huge island down them between Thailand in Indonesia is one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find the artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics of that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road loose swamp\nIn the inner villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top and with a Dutch miner or thirty four year old anthropologist named Renee waltzing and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff\nAnd people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one as Matt was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and uh\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence of which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an circle part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and\nMichael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world and he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nTime and you know you could be very wealthy sophisticated but from a cultural point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into a society where one of the great\nIronies of the story is that you know this is a a man from who represents you know the most powerful family and the most powerful country in the world in and asked mad at the crucial moment he was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy and power and it's all about taking somebody's power and\nThe head hunting and you know when the as men men who killed them did so they were taking back their power sort of a desperate bid to take power back that had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and dodge efforts to pacify them and take away their culture and [noise]\nAnd they consume them and there's no more [noise]\nArticulate display of of power than that so\nDid they eat Rockefeller thinking they were just eating a white guy that represented colonialism or did they know they were eating a man from the most powerful family in the most powerful white country\nThey didn't know anything about the Rockefeller's the Rockefeller name meant nothing to them I mean it's a complex\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friend\nThan as I said the Dutch we're trying to pacify the ads mad and in Nineteen fifty seven\nThere was a war between two villages and many are men were killed in a local men you know they killed each other and a very aggressive or racist Dutch Colonial patrol officer went to the village specifically to teach the village the lesson as he wrote in his report said he\nWas afraid and he brought a lot of armed policemen with them and he arrived in to this village of ... which was a\nLegendary a you know traditional place to place that had resisted the incursions of the Dutch and didn't want to change its ways why should it why would want to\nHe ended up opening fire and killing five people and that left the village with a sacred obligation to you know everything was arriving spiritually and it left the village with a sacred obligation to reciprocate the man's death than Michael kind of swim into that as it turned out so he\nGave them the opportunity to reciprocate basically by stumbling into their world he did\nCarl Hoffman spin on assignment to more than Seventy countries has a report today on travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he discovered about the plight of Michael the Rockefeller has he investigated his disappearance Hynden deadly clash between cultures in the jungles of New Guinea his book is called Savage\nHarvest [noise] no I I don't want I guess I'm focusing on kind of listen it's fascinating and apparently it's it's a reality but I guess when these tribal people decide to eat a human being is not a matter of nutrition it's not like the Donner Party it's a matter of um power and symbolism is that right\nYeah it's not like you know we're hungry let's go get a Big Mac or anything it was easier to get an animal\nIn that regard but you're just searching yourself by symbolic\nWell I mean it's rare to all this theory somebody yeah it gets very complex but no cannibalism is with in a is a sacred to act with in a complex Web of\nObligation and ceremony and customary laws and that has great meaning and important\nIs there a ritual aesthetic way to actually cook the person\nYes very much so which I won't go into a here but I Do in the book\nThe Rockefeller family are maintained that their son was was not a victim of chemicals\nHe was actually on a boat crossing the mouth of a river that engine trouble and then flipped over and drifted and Michael said you know I think he violated the first law ... which is to you know never leave the boat as long as it's still flowed and he said I think I can make it and\nRene ... Singh who was older and wiser said then you know if you go you're on your own I'm not leaving and Michael did and he swam way in the boat and he was never seen again\nAnd there was a massive search and of course Renee was rescued the following day by Dutch patrol planes there was a massive search for Michael you know Nelson then Michael sister Mary both went to New Guinea immediately and", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "27"}
