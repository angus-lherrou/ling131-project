got the same challenges in the United states and\nIt sort of disarmed us to go back to the fifties and and look at it and how how it was dealt with in that time\nAnd then to sort of be haunted by the fact that we're still struggling with it today talk for a minute mark too about the whole idea of the adjustment for a society where women all of a sudden are going to be more respected and at the same time expect more in the same time I had that sense when I saw you even when you were feeling\nFrom Britain back to Australia after the war in in a place to go home the sense was you were going to march right in there and this is a new age and women are going to be respected\nWell that's what I had always been very family by swimming in the kitchen men out to work it really had begun that way I feel very very long time and as I say much demand left so the women had to fill those roles they were pushed out of the kitchen and into the workforce\nThe thing about Sarah she comes way they'll say
