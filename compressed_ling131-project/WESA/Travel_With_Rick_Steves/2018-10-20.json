entered into Africa in the nineteenth century and Shakespeare's presence is still very much alive there today his plays had been translated into Swahili and South Sudanese Arabic to become a point of cultural pride for many in East Africa\nEdward Wilson we grew up in Kenya and he now teaches Shakespeare at Cambridge gift blurs the universal appeal Shakespeare in his book Shakespeare in Swahili Edwards thanks for being here thanks for having me on right now this is so fascinating to think of Shakespeare breaking out of\nWestern culture especially in the East Africa can you first of all tell us about your passion for Shakespeare in your work at Cambridge\nI have been obsessed with ... and say you know a fairly young age I spent my childhood in Kenya and wasn't one of these children who had a ... in the book\nThe entire time I spent my childhood or off pretending to be here is rather than reading about them a but certainly um since my teen years off in a difficulty of Shakespeare and I went on to\nRead that University in and then teach at Cambridge but it wasn't until I happened upon this project that I managed to connect these two very disparate parts of my life\nNow the subtitle of your book a Shakespeare in Swahili land is in search of a global poet it's kind of like elevating Shakespeare to be more than just a a hero of western literature but global how could he be global without being merely cultural imperialism\nYeah well I think a part of the story is suddenly about cultural imperialism um it's about a British rate is taking Shakespeare to East Africa as a kind of ... to protect them against the dock continent\nButs what few people realize is that very early on in his history Shakespeare became detached from Britain from being simply a British possession\nAnd was translated into a wide number of uh of languages so for instance one of the great discoveries in this book was to find that Indians who had taken Shakespeare from British culture back in India but had been proved type to build the railways in East Africa in the twentieth century\nHad is extraordinary culture all performance of Shakespeare in Mumbai in nearly twenty century I at one point shake it was being performed a more in Mumbai southern in London's west that and\nThese were you know glorious Lee irreverent productions much like Shakespeare's own day you know shake it was that was no released his check first day was a mad at the state has to do what's necessary to get bums on seats to entertain the audience and these were very much\nShakespeare plays but taken in re made 'em to speak to the people who are performing them in Mumbai, India you're twenty century so I think you know as long as things that become\nPetrified as long as we you know we didn't put things on a pedestal and insist that they don't change in order to understand them in New ways than set knees Shakespeare can and has come and live in very very different places than than where he originally wrote the place\nThat's an amazing image immigrant laborers from India working on real way in Kenya adapting Shakespeare plays to entertain themselves and and make life jolly is another example of our Shakespeare sort of a appeals to people that several levels were these players when they're used by for instance immigrant labor is from India in East Africa\nAre they adapted to fit the culture or the amped up to be more entertaining or on their level or are they just\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nDid uh getting is a wonderful twelfth night where instead of being shipwreck off the coast of bohemian as happened in Shakespeare's play the opening scene sees a train wreck which sweeps they are the main characters down or with a into a movie called kingdom and I'll take that's going to speak to people\nWho are themselves working on a very dangerous set of uh of of railway construction projects\nYou know the hamlet settled ... called ... Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation against spoiler alert here since anyone who's never see for me and Juliet uh instead of stabbing herself at the end of the play she uses a poisonous

reimagining of the plate and one that pact out houses or the U.S.'s\nWith five hundred people every night of the week at these corrugated on shacks in a fledgling city of Mumbai on you know I think it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East Africa in cities even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land\nIn search of a global poet Edward is it safe\nTo say I mean your focus is East Africa but would this be\nEast Africa as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and we're going to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet\n... they're extraordinary Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he used as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the explorers he's used by that mission race to create a written culture of Swahili language\nIs now a spoken by a hundred million people\nHe's translated into Swahili he's you know he's performed by these Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flashpoint but talking about the extent to which these countries in the aftermath of colonialism want to be open to the culture of the people who had been ... over ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYeah so Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to and it's one which hopefully capture has a set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda\nParts of the Congo allowing him which Swahili is either the main or one of the major languages\nThis also in the region was government as a kind of a single entity by the British as a colony so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices and mission rage landed on the coast which is why I asked what he has spoken Swahili is\nKind of very Arabic influenced onto language and\nAs the colonial governments moved inland and uh they would damned if they were going to speak I learned more than one language so they made everyone else learns why he has they moved inland and while he is just\nHappens to be a convenient language for the cloning overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise precisely\nSo it it is a legacy of ... but on the other hand it's also I like to see that it's created to shed culture between all of them are African culture within an order\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say

chest cold ed wood ... who was the the mission ... to Central Africa sent out from Britain\nHe arrives in Zanzibar in Eighteen sixty seven and he is a missionary and it's his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity but he sees it as central to lead to create electricity so he actually spends a lot of the time\nTrying to understand local cultures translating Swahili\n... into English and trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili is a translation and the off chance and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational tax to the school children in Kenya and Tanzania to almost a century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their face and in order to do that people had to be literate and missionaries had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a ... a you believe that one guard has

each corner the island nation that has made many local friends he's talking studio now to share his passion for one of the hottest traveled destinations anywhere these days and it's music seems Kevin thanks for joining us and thanks so much for having me Rick appreciate that of all places to take a radio crew to broadcast live\nWhy would you choose Iceland and why be going back for so many years in a row\nOne reason is they have an incredible music scene has some ...\nA little history on K XP were a Seattle based radio station with a global audience and we're committed to finding a discovery in great music no matter where it's being created\nWe had been going to music festivals in the United states like south by southwest in Austin, Texas and see I'm Jay in New York City but to the first trip to Iceland as a station I really wanted to make a point to the K XP would travel to the\nFarthest corners of the earth to find the great music to share with our listeners worldwide really ... you know music is like travel in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power of music and bring people together\nIt helps create a more tolerant an understanding world as we get to have those experiences through music and get to understand each other through various different types of music and uh you come to realize that\nThe world is a lot smaller place a than sometimes we think it is even when it's far away and there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use is your entree into a more ...\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd a music certainly it's almost a cliche but it's international language you can sit in a pub in Ireland or or I suppose in a small concert hall in in Reykjavik and feel like you're celebrating the same thing with local people\nAbsolutely and I and I think that's part of what drives K XP and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music there is that magic spark sometimes\nI've been in in traditional music or sessions and Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really yeah\nTransformation ours is such a great word to describe a\nWhen you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and not tell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was\nI wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch different places but there was a band called secret rows and they uh had an album called I'll get to us here in the [noise]\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that um I was like I Want to go to the land this Mueller that came from where that came\nYeah I Want to try and understand that there's something about that if I listen to some music for Greek if I wanted to go to the fewer and look at the view where his cabin was when he was inspired to write that you have the music is sometimes so unfair and you want to be translated it then\nYou want to go to the to the place from where it blossomed guess music and sometimes it inside the U.S travel okay so you're organizing this now in the sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yeah so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back [laughter]\nOh you didn't want to go back because you thought you'd be ruining it ruining ... yeah I you know it's so hard to replicate something of reality about\nIt yeah if I go back with a TV crew in history where is the magic I was your last year was incredible do it again yeah and\nSometimes it doesn't so I did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of ice on my radio show I ended up hooking up with their trade commissioner and general counsel if you're in North America leaner good Johnson\nAnd that to a series of events ended up culminating in is actually going to Iceland and broadcasting live and I had to do a scouting location or your trip before\nAnd I've been fourteen or Fifteen times now and every time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and we would not keep going back in broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year over year which is remarkable for a country of three hundred and twenty five thousand people\nBut it is this music that comes out of Iceland or is this a celebration of many cultures that go to be together in Iceland well it's a bit of both now well the music fest we broadcast from its called ice on the airways and it's a showcase for Icelandic end Nordic\nBans new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries along with a beautifully curated selection of international bands sevens and gathering of

right now in travel with Rick Steves is Kevin ...\nHe's the program director of Seattle's noncommercial K.
